Malaria prevention depends on two important measures -- taking a drug that combats the parasite prior to infection, and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito.
Chloroquine has long been used to prevent and treat malaria, and it is still used in areas where the parasite has not yet developed resistance.
An alternative, melfloquine (trade name Lariam) is extremely effective but very expensive and has numerous incapacitating side-effects.
Another effective alternative, doxycycline, has milder side-effects than melfloquine but be taken more rigorously.
A newer drug, Malarone, a combination of atovaquone and proguanil (an old therapy), is in the process of gaining approval.
It has numerous side effects but they are less serious than those of melfloquine.
Researchers are now widening their focus to different aspects of the parasite's life cycle, and are developing a multi-pronged vaccine to help the immune system at various stages of the disease.
Protective clothing, insect repellents, and curtains and netting (preferably insecticide-impregnated) are used for avoiding mosquito contact.
People are encouraged to destroy mosquito habitats by cleaning their surroundings and removing stationary water ponds.
Malaria is curable if detected early and treated appropriately.
Fansidar is a standby treatment, and only used in emergencies when patients develop malaria symptoms and are far from medical care.
One of the best hopes is a Chinese plant, ching hao su, which is being used in Asia as a very effective treatment, but has yet to meet international standards.
Funding is continually sought for educational and early response programs and supplies.
