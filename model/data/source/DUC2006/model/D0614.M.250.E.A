Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960's, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain some momentum in recent years.
A 1995 a referendum on Quebec independence was defeated, but by a much smaller margin than previously.
The Quebec Premier resigned and the new leader, Lucien Bouchard, vowed to keep the independence movement alive.
In a 1998 provincial election Bouchard won more seats (but slightly less of the popular vote) and did not get enough votes to permit another referendum immediately.
Polls also show support for separation had declined, although there was feeling that just the threat of separation is enough to bring about change.
However, even without a referendum Bouchard's re-election could increase tensions and uncertainty in Canada.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court decided against the constitutionality of unilateral secession.
However, it did say that if a majority of Quebeckers voted in favor of secession, federal officials would be obliged to negotiate.
Bouchard is now in a position to work any attempt to provide changes to his advantage.
One is for increased power in managing the health care system.
If his proposals are rebuffed he can open the way to another referendum, which he said he would do if "winning conditions exist".
So Bouchard may or may not bring about another referendum, which he may or may not do if there are winning conditions, although he won't specify what they are.
That's why there is still uncertainty in Quebec!
