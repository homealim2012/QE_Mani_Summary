Signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are preoccupation with details, rules, lists, order, organization or schedules; perfectionism; excessive devotion to work and productivity; inability to discard worn out or worthless objects; and being over-conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible.
Symptoms include panic attacks, obsessive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares, and frightening physical symptoms.
Hallmarks are senseless and repetitive thoughts and behaviors that typically deal with grooming, contamination, or danger.
Examples are excessive hand washing or wringing, constant fidgeting, twitching, discomfort in crowds, or repeated checking to make sure doors are locked.
Anxiety disorders can be treated through targeted psychotherapy or medications.
Drugs work best when combined with cognitive or behavioral psychotherapy.
Drugs approved for use with OCD are sertraline (Zoloft); clomipramine (Anafranil); and the antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox).
Clomipramine's side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation.
The antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) also works but may make people feel they have lost part of themselves.
Prozac's other side effects include sexual dysfunction and sleeplessness.
Paxil (also FDA-approved for treating OCD), Prozac and Zoloft are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and take several weeks to become effective.
Fluorextine is being tested for OCD use.
Half of OCD children respond to drug treatment.
A possible OCD treatment is implantation of electrodes into the thalamus to break abnormal oscillation patterns.
OCD sufferers often have overlapping problems with depression, anxiety, or eating or body dysmorphic disorders.
OCD is in the class of anxiety disorders, which also include panic, post-traumatic stress, and phobias such as social phobia.
Animal hoarding may involve OCD.
