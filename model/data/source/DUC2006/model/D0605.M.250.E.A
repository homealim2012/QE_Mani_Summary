Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) drugs are for pain, inflammation, and disease modification.
An acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) is used to treat pain alone.
Aspirin, motrin, and steroids are used for inflammation.
Paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and topical medications are for pain and inflammation.
Older NSAIDS include Advil, Daypro, Lodine, Naprosyn.
Three new NSAIDS containing COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors have been developed - meloxicam (Mobic), Celebra, and Vioxx.
They are painkillers that cut inflammation with no stomach distress.
Hyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk) are new injectable drugs.
For disease modification doctors prescribe sulfasalazine, chloroquine, penicillamine, gold, and methotrexate.
Weight loss and exercise are recommended.
When other methods fail, patients may have joint replacement.
Nutritional supplements -- particularly glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate -- have become trendy for treating osteoarthritis.
Other non-traditional treatments include ginger extract HMP-33, bee venom, copper bracelets, Chinese herbs, acupuncture, tai chi, stinging nettle, Thunder God vine, Ayurveda, qi gong, and electromagnetic resonance.
Research led scientists to develop drugs that treat the pain/inflammation-producing enzymes but not the stomach-protecting enzymes.
This led to COX-2 inhibitors.
Research shows HMP-33 and SAM-e (S-Adenosylmethionine) give relief from pain with no negative side effects.
Meloxicam causes few gastrointestinal complications.
Glucosamine and chondroitin sooth knee pain as well as ibuprophen but without side effects.
However, there is not enough data on them.
Electromagnetic resonance is still being tested.
There is no evidence to back up claims of copper bracelets, shark cartilage, and alfalfa.
Studies on acupuncture and arthroscopic surgery suggest improvement may be psychological.
