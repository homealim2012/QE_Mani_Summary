Many organic gardeners feel pests mainly attack stressed or sick plants.
They keep plants healthy and stress-free by careful tending including good light and moisture control.
Methods of controlling insect pests in organic plantings include natural predators such as spiders, wasps, praying mantises, ladybugs, ants, jumping spiders, chickens, and parasitic nematodes.
Organic gardeners also use fauna such as garlic, aromatic herbs, French marigolds, plants in the onion family such as chives and garlic, basil, natural and developed fungi.
Other insect pest control methods include repeated defoliation, hot pepper spray, row covers, sticky traps, vacuuming, avoiding beetle season, and the use of "trap crops" like alfalfa to lure bugs away from "cash crops" like strawberries.
For moth worms that eat cranberry crops farmers use replicated moth pheromones in liquid form to sexually confuse the moths and prevent the mating and subsequent laying of eggs which become worms and eat cranberry plants.
Organic farmers also use trichogrammas, whatever that is.
For fungi pests organic farmers resort to pruning, "cooking" the soil with solar heat via plastic ground covers, and biodiverse planting.
Approved pesticides for organic gardens include botanical pesticides like neem, rotenone, and pyrethrum.
Spray applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var.
san diego or var.
tenebrionsis have been developed for organic gardens.
A "balanced farm ecosystem", as recommended by the philosophy of biodynamics, will control pests.
