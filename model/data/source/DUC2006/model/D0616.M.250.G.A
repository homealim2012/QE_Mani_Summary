In December 1994 Russian troops were sent into Chechnya to crush a separatist drive led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. In March 1996 Boris Yeltsin halted the offensive, initiating a partial withdrawal from Chechen areas, but warned that more terrorist attacks would be dealt with severely.
He promised free and democratic elections and suggested amnesty for some combatants.
At this time Chechnya won de facto independence and could run its own affairs, but was left devastated and lawless.
To prevent the spread of violence Russia spent the next year strengthening the border areas but did not send troops into Chechnya itself.
Yeltsin expressed support for Chechnya's government and intended to resume negotiations.
By 1999, under Putin, Russian air raids continued escalating along the Chechen border to combat aggression.
They first bombed suspected rebel bases, then economic installations and civilian communications facilities.
Chechens blamed Russia for many civilian deaths.
Russia began its military operations inside Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate of terrorist acts in Russian cities that killed over 300.
Russia was determined to liberate Chechnya from the terrorists and restore normal life and by the end of 1999 Russian troops occupied over 60% of Chechnya.
However, the rebels geared up again and during 2000 launched isolated attacks, turning to bombings and the hit-and-run tactics that were effective in 1994-1996.
The turbulence resulted in thousands of Chechens trying to leave the republic, and many human rights issues came under examination .
