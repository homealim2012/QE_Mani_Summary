Obsessive-compulsive disorder, (OCD) is one of many anxiety disorders with emotional, psychological, and biological underpinnings and can be treated through targeted psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of the two.
OCD affects 2% of adults but the first signs often appear in childhood.
Symptoms are senseless and repetitive thoughts and behaviors that typically deal with grooming, contamination, or danger.
An example is excessive hand-washing.
Animal hoarding (keep excessive pets) may be a symptom.
Three similar drugs which have worked well on children in large trials are sertraline (marketed as Zoloft), clomiprimane (marketed as Anafranil), and fluvoxamine (marketed as Luvox).
They all buoy brain levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger between nerves.
Also, the anti-depressant fluoxetine, marketed as Prozac, has worked well in small trials on childhood OCD.
Paxil, another drug used for OCD, is from a class of psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that includes Prozac and Zoloft.
Cognitive Therapy, the moderation of our moods by manipulating our thoughts, has shown to be useful for treating OCD.
Sufferers of OCD often have overlapping problems with depression, eating disorders, or other anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks and BDD (body dysmorphic disorder).
One theory is that OCD, depression, tinnitus, chronic pain, and Parkinson's symptoms (shaking and immobility) all stem from the same basic brain defect -- a decoupling of two brain regions that normally fire their cells in symmetry.
