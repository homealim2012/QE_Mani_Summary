Steroids have been in increasing use since first observed in international competition in 1956.
Used legitimately for some diseases, steroids are used to build up muscles, strength, and endurance, and are taken by female as well as male athletes.
The relative newness of women's sports allows countries to make inroads more quickly than in men's athletics.
With the lure of scholarships and professional ventures there is more at stake now than ever for female athletes.
Use of steroids by 8-12th grade girls has gone up 100% from 1996 to 1998.
During the 1990's they were in widespread use in international competitions, affecting women athletes from many nations and sports fields.
Steroids increase the amount of testosterone, which is dramatic in women because of the small amount in their bodies originally.
However, there are many side effects, including liver damage, increase in facial hair, voice changes, acne, sterility, enlarged Adam's apple, shrinkage of the uterus, gynecological problems, elevated cholesterol, aggressive behavior, and stunted growth in younger users.
The consequences of steroid use, physically, are strain on liver, kidneys, and heart, leading to vascular damage and risks of blood-clotting, stroke, and heart attack.
Abnormal incidences of cancer, birth defects, and depression have also been associated with steroid use.
Legal and professional consequences include suspension and banning from competitions, dropping from teams, fines, loss of promotional contracts, and loss of awards and medals.
Coaches and doctors who administer steroids to unknowing athletes risk fines or prison.
