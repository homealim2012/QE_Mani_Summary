Most auto safety experts believe the seat belt is the single most effective auto safety device.
Some states are enacting laws to require seat belt usage and some auto makers are installing audio and visual signals to show when belts are not engaged.
Seat belts are being improved and some are adjustable to accommodate the size of the user.
Side and rear seat air bags are now available from many manufacturers in addition to front air bags.
One maker offers a curtain-like side air bag to add a measure of safety during a rollover.
Dual inflation levels for air bags are proposed since some bags inflating in low speed crashes have been blamed for killing several people, mostly children.
Improperly installed child seats have been responsible for children injuries and fatalities.
Some governmental units and some auto dealers are offering free advice and assistance in the proper installation of children's seats.
Crash tests, including tests with dummies in the rear seats provide valuable information for safety planners.
Researchers have suggested using "black boxes" in cars like those used in aircraft to record data pertinent to an auto crash to lead to safety improvements.
Anti-lock brakes are a very important safety factor and some autos have adjustable pedals so that drivers are not too close to air bag deployment.
Other safety devices in limited use are reverse sensing devices to warn of the closeness of objects behind the car and sensors to warn of low tire pressure.
