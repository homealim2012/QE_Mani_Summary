ADHD, a common psychiatric illness that affects 3-9% of all children, is difficult to diagnose because there is no easy test like a blood test.
Outward symptoms generally include impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty in learning, and restlessness.
Type A is characterized by inattentiveness and distractability, Type B by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, and Type C a combination of the two.
Type D patients have symptoms that can disrupt everyday life but none that clearly fit the other three forms.
Brain scans show a chemical abnormality.
If approved, a 90% effective biological test monitoring activity in the front of the brain will be the first laboratory procedure for diagnosing ADHD.
Behavior-modification therapy is the primary treatment in Britain but in the U.S. drugs have been found more effective.
One treatment is methylphenidate (tradename Ritalin), a mild nervous system stimulant which may boost levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain.
Adderall, a mixture of two kinds of amphetamines, is effective for treating ADHD and is used largely for children who don't respond to methylphenidate.
Concerta can be taken for once-a-day dosing.
Clonidine is also used.
Alza Corporation is manufacturing a one-a-day pill based on methylphenidate.
Claims that dietary supplements help are questionable.
Controversies surrounding ADD/ADHD treatment are that no one knows the long-range effects of the drugs.
Some critics think the drugs are over-prescribed and suppress a child's natural spontaneity rather than correcting a brain chemistry imbalance.
They also fear an increase of recreational drug use amongst teens and pre-teens.
