WASHINGTON May 6 (Xinhua) At a time when the opening of the 1996 summer Olympic Games is drawing the host city Atlant was rated as the most violent city in the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics.
The FBI figures revealed Sunday show that while crime nationwide fell 2 percent in 1995 crime in Atlanta rose 4 percent in the year.
The figures make Atlanta s crime rate the highest among U.
It topped the rankings in both violent and non violent crime.
However officials from the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) said said A.
ACOG has mounted a massive security operation to protect the Games with more than 25 000 federal state and local law enforcement officers and military personnel.
They will be assisted by thousands of agents from the FBI CIA and other secret services.
In preparation for the worst security forces held a series of anti terrorism exercises in the city last month and law enforcement officers uncovered a underground bomb factory in central Georgia and arrested two men.
Reports said that ACOG security officials have travelled to foreign countries to get advice on anti terrorist tactics.
Survey Shows Violent Crime Drop in U.
WASHINGTON November 15 (Xinhua) Violent crimes fell 10 percent in 1996 in the United States says an annual U.
Justice Department survey of victims released Saturday.
The overall victimization rates from all crimes were at their lowest level since the survey of victims began 23 years ago the survey said The 1996 violent crime rate against victims was down 16 percent from 1993.
Property crime was down 8 percent last year and was 17 percent lower than 1993.
Other crimes against persons including rape attempted rape other sexual assaults and aggravated assaults also were down dramatically during the 1993 96 period.
Likewise household burglary motor vehicle theft personal theft such as purse snatching fell 19 percent 29 percent 35 percent respectively.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics says the victims survey is in general agreement with the FBI figures released last September.
Crime Rate Drops with No Definite Reasons Known.
LOS ANGELES February 2 (Xinhua) California and the rest of the United States have reported continuing drop in crime rates but it seems difficult for police as well as criminologists to explain why.
California state law enforcement authorities point to community policing and tougher sentences as the primary factors for the drop of crime.
But even law enforcement oriented sources note that increase in police staffing levels and hard line enforcement and prosecution policies fail to totally account for falling crime rates.
Perhaps there is not a single soundbite that has the answer.
Nationwide the recent improvement in the economy age demographics gang war cycles the waning interest in drugs like crack and community policing are often used by experts to explain the decline.
Violent crime nationwide declined by five percent in the first six months of 1997 according to FBI statistics and property crimes dropped by four percent.
Department of Justice shows violent crime down nationwide by 10 percent and property crime down by eight percent.
Some types of criminal activity had dropped by as much as 44 percent in the past four years.
Many academics and law enforcement sources note that crime always seems to drop when employment rates are high.
A study of declining homicide rate in seven cities by the National Institute of Justice also found a potential connection between employment and crime.
But this hypothesis does not apply to some cities where economic conditions have improved since 1992 but some crimes climbed steeply.
The country s aging population is also a common explanation for falling crime rates.
According to this hypothesis the number of people between the ages of 18 and 40 an age group in which most potential offenders are to be found has declined by more than seven percent since 1990.
Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in the nation s crack cocaine problem which is associated with large increase in violence crime among young people in the 1980s.
Law enforcement advocates tend to credit the recent apparent decline in crime to a nationwide tougher sentencing laws and more aggressive policing strategies.
Attorney General Janet Reno noting that crime had decreased steadily since 1994 one said that tougher sentences and hiring more local police officers are California s "three strikes " which dealing with repeated offenders with heavy prison terms is often cited as an example for tougher sentencing laws.
Under the "three strikes you er out" law which was enacted in 1994 a person who has two previous violent or serious felony convictions must by sentenced to a term of 25 years to life in person for each new felony conviction whether or not violent or serious which must by served consecutively.
Critics of the law say that it has had a minimal impact on crime rates but has tied up public resources on prison expansion and construction that could have been used on other governmental programs.
The National Institute of Justice in a study of the national "three strike" movement also says that it is still too early to tell whether California s tougher sentencing law is having any substantial impact on crime rates although it has had a major effect on the state s prison capacity and criminal court caseloads.
"Three strikes" is not the only thing special in California.
Politicians and police through Southern California are pushing architects and developers to tailor their projects with subtle crime fighting features such as better lighting strategically placed thorny bougainvillea bushes and even pouring rose colored concrete for walkways.
The system is known in government circles as The idea is that troublemakers don t want to be seen and buildings should be designed so the owners can see them.
Now Los Angeles is in the forefront of promoting the system on a metropolitan scale.
PATAKI PLANS CRIME FIGHTING SYSTEM MODELED ON NEW YORK CITY PROGRAM.
Borrowing from a crime fighting tool used in New York City Gov.
George Pataki has announced a pilot program designed to help counties share crime data map trends and nab more criminals.
The program is modeled after New York City s successful Comstat system which turns dry crime statistics into maps of criminal hot spots.
Within a year the state hopes to institute a similar data sharing system among 10 counties with the hope that this will help the police agencies map county to county trends share resources and confront crime more effectively.
Officials hope to expand the program statewide by 1999.
Criminals don t abide by jurisdictional borders Pataki Republican said in announcing the program Monday.
The pilot program includes the counties that comprise the State Police Troop G area including Albany Rensselaer Saratoga and Schenectady counties.
New York City s crime rate has plummeted during the time it has been using the Comstat tracking system fueling a statistical drop in crime statewide.
Murders dropped by 44 percent statewide between 1995 and 1997 and rapes have declined 15 percent according to projections made by the Department of Criminal Justice Services.
In Rensselaer County for example violent crime increased 33 percent between 1992 and 1996.
Between 1996 and 1997 it jumped another 6 percent according to the most recent statewide statistics.
The police and prosecutors in some upstate areas have said they fear that as New York City s crime rate drops criminals move northward where drugs fetch higher prices.
In 1996 for example 1 226 of the suspects arrested in Albany said they were born in New York City up from 644 in 1991 city records show.
A kilo of heroin that sells for as little as 75 000 in New York City can trade for as much as 180 000 in the Albany area.
There s no doubt that we do get some crime from New York City said Albany Police Chief Kevin Tuffey adding that the problem of dealing with the criminal commute north was the subject of a law enforcement seminar held two weeks ago in New York City.
The Pataki administration s pilot program is called the Crime Analysis Partnerships to Upgrade Regional Enforcement or CAPTURE.
The CAPTURE system which will cost an estimated 500 000 to start will enable the police in one area to tap into a program that will tell them if the police in another jurisdiction have encountered a similar crime pattern.
They (criminals) are moving in the direction of least resistance said Deputy Chief Jack Nielsen of the Albany Police Department.
But the program may require the state to equip the smaller policing agencies with a computer or a fax machine enabling them to provide data to the state on a weekly or biweekly basis.
AS NYC GROWS SAFER CRIME LOOSENS ITS GRIP ON THE NEWS.
NEW YORK It was a slow news day in the depths of summer.
Thirteen Ohio factory workers had won a 296 million lottery.
WCBS TV Channel 2 in New York City chose a different story to lead its 6 p.
Seven women had been harassed over the previous two months on a jogging path in Westchester County.
Several other times someone tried without success to grab one of the women the station reported.
Since no one had been hurt or arrested (police were not even sure if they had one or several suspects) the incidents might seem an odd choice as the top news in the nation s largest city.
In the early 1990s when the New York crime rate was much higher the report would have been unlikely to make the broadcast much less lead it.
The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New York s television news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the city s crime rate has dropped for the last half dozen years.
The crime stories reported by the local news organizations these days are noticeably different having a greater emphasis on sexual attacks and child abuse.
There are more reports on crimes in the suburbs and the outer reaches of the region as well as stepped up coverage of the inner workings of the Police Department itself including police misconduct.
But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime particularly in New York City s three major daily newspapers where change is most pronounced.
In the first two weeks of May 1994 for example there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in The New York Daily News The New York Post and The New York Times.
In the first two weeks of May this year there were only a third as many articles about crime in the three newspapers.
On many days in May there was no crime news at all in The Daily News or The Post where once it was a staple.
On local television news which has been criticized for years for its daily diet of murder and mayhem there appears to be a reduction as well though much more modest.
It is impossible to quantify because news directors at New York s major network owned stations refused to make available videotapes or written records of old broadcasts.
There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the contents of local news four or more years ago.
But many current and former television news executives say that for many years at least 30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on local newscasts were about crime.
The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts on the three network owned stations with the largest audiences WCBS TV WNBC TV and WABC TV over four weeks this summer and crime was the subject of 27 percent of the reports.
On some evenings reports about crime represented a majority of the reports on local news shows and many minutes of air time at the start of the broadcasts were devoted to them.
But on other nights crime news was relatively brief and came late in the shows.
These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable decline of violent crime in New York where the number of killings has diminished from 2 245 in 1990 to 767 last year.
At the current rate there would be fewer than 600 this year the lowest total in three decades.
Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions especially by people who manage local television news operations to adjust somewhat the tone and content of their daily reports.
There is a positive feeling overall and I think reporters and editors come into the workplace feeling that because we all live in the same community said WCBS TV news director Bill Carey.
Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result of police department policies that make it more difficult to get information on crime and access to police officials.
Six or seven years ago when there were nearly six killings a day in New York City on average the basic question for crime reporters was which of the grisly homicides to cover.
There was seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or on the Police Department as an institution.
Crime news often crowded out other subjects on television.
Today there is less and less crime that is worthy of any coverage said Bart Feder news director at Channel 7 WABC TV.
This is an opportunity to fill the shows in a more interesting and diverse way.
I think there is more commitment at all the stations to enterprise reporting to investigative reporting to honest to goodness journalism.
Feder s counterparts at other New York City stations offer the same assessment and on some nights there is evidence to buttress their view.
news shows also offered considerable evidence to the contrary.
Some nights local stations compensate for the murder gap by covering crimes committed in other places and by reporting on local crimes that not long ago would have passed unnoticed.
A few weeks ago for example Channel 7 sent a reporter to Westchester for a long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police cars on highways to counter road rage.
Local stations also reported in recent weeks on the arrest of a man in Freehold N.
accused of stabbing his wife a sexual assault on an employee of a Bronx motel and a double homicide in Bayonne N.
But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism on local stations reports on serious subjects that might have had difficulty getting on the air when television news was overwhelmed by body bags.
28 Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock market s slide might affect New York City s budget.
The previous week a Channel 4 reporter assessed the accuracy of campaign advertisements by Democratic candidates for governor and the U.
nn Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still too much crime on local television.
There s no question that it is still the predominant item said David Klatell head of the broadcast program at Columbia University s Graduate School of Journalism.
Television news has always been a much more emotive and emotional medium than a logical one and so the fear of crime persists even if the reality doesn t.
It s much easier to cover crime than to cover the school system or race relations.
Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to study the content of local television news two years ago.
They analyzed broadcasts in eight cities on four nights during the 1996 1997 television season.
2 percent of the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted to crime well above the eight city average of 20.
A similar analysis of the television season that ended last spring is not finished.
Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News the all news cable station with influencing coverage on the larger network owned stations.
Since it started in 1992 NY1 has tried to balance crime news with beat reporting on everything from government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods.
Steve Paulus the senior vice president for news at NY1 said that his station was devoting less time to crime these days.
Where a police reporter would have covered the crime of the day he said the police reporter is now more likely to be covering police department issues.
Paradoxically the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause journalists to react more strongly to major crimes.
The decline in crime means that those that do occur take on a prominence seem more newsworthy than they did in the past said Daily News managing editor Arthur Browne.
Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another factor in the decline of crime news is that the police share information less readily and are generally less cooperative.
Some police reporters said that they could usually get enough information to report breaking crime news but that it was often difficult if not impossible to learn enough for analytic or other enterprise articles.
This administration has made a concerted drive to keep bad news out of the papers and off the screen said Gabe Pressman the veteran television reporter who is president of the New York Press Club.
Whether it is by design or by chance the decrease of crime news in the city s papers is startling.
On May 4 for example there was a single crime article in The Daily News buried deep on page 24.
a 13 year old Long Island boy had been shot in the shoulder by a stray bullet possibly from a nearby shooting range.
The Times in its local pages had one reference to crime.
The following day there were no reports on crime in The News The Times or The Post.
On May 6 there was one article in The Post on page 7 about the arrest of a substitute teacher in Queens accused of hitting students with a chair.
The News put the same story on page 8 next to an article about an investigation into whether police officers had covered up for an off duty detective involved in a car crash.
The Times carried an article on the substitute teacher on page B1.
That week and the following one the front pages of New York s tabloids where crime once was king were taken up with the Knicks playoff chances new cancer drugs and the final episode of Seinfeld.
There are really two possible explanations for this said Mitchell Stephens acting chairman of the journalism department at New York University.
One is that the reality has changed and news reflects reality.
The other is that competitive organizational pressures in the news business are responsible for the waxing and waning of crime coverage.
Stephens who has a new book on video and television called The Rise of the Image the Fall of the Word said the arrival of New York Newsday in the 1980s led to a brutal circulation war in the city.
In time honored American fashion he said newspapers sought circulation by concentrating on crime.
The death of New York Newsday eased the circulation wars he said reducing pressure on editors to pursue crime.
Stephens also offered a second theory for the diminished attention to crime by the New York news organizations.
Maybe people are feeling less paranoid he said and it is harder to push those buttons.
CRIME RATE FALLS 3 PERCENT NATIONWIDE.
WASHINGTON The nation s overall crime rate in 1997 fell for the sixth consecutive year with the rate of violent crimes such as murders and robberies showing the sharpest drop the FBI reported Sunday.
The nation s big cities experienced the steepest decline in their crime rate with a 5 percent drop while suburban counties saw a decrease of 4 percent and rural areas were down 1 percent.
Criminal experts and law enforcement officials attributed the drop to several factors including the aging of baby boomers increased incarceration of criminals declining use of crack additional police officers and better policing methods.
Overall the rate of violent crimes fell 4 percent from 1996 helping to push down the overall U.
crime rate by 3 percent its lowest level in over a decade the FBI reported.
In the past four years the murder rate has plummeted by more than 25 percent.
Robberies fell 8 percent while aggravated assaults and forcible rapes decreased 2 percent and 1 percent respectively.
It s definitely continues the trend of good news about crime said James Alan Fox dean of Northeastern University s College of Criminal Justice.
In the coming years these declines could turn quickly.
Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are influencing the nation s crime rate.
First the aging of the baby boom generation which makes up 25 percent of the population has pushed down the number of crimes because adults tend to be less violent than juveniles.
At the same time the number of crimes committed by teen agers has risen sharply since the mid 1980s.
The number of murders committed by teen agers increased 145 percent between 1985 and 1995.
And although the number of violent crimes committed by juveniles has fallen slightly in the past two years the number of teen agers will grow quickly over the next decade.
Currently there are 40 million children under the age of 10 nationwide.
Fox said future crime rates will be determined by how society deals with the rising tide of teen agers over the next decade.
Right now crime rates peak in the couple of hours between the end of school and when most parents get home for dinner he said.
That tells you that our children are not getting enough supervision from their parents.
At a press conference Thursday Attorney General Janet Reno warned Americans not to relax their vigilance about crime about enforcement about prevention.
She said the large number of people growing through their teens and early 20s over the next decade presents law enforcement officials with a challenge but that these kids do not have to become criminals.
We ve got to make sure as we have more young people that we have more programs for them more opportunities to give them a strong and positive future Reno said.
All regions of the country saw crime rates fall in 1997 with the Northeast experiencing the largest drop 5 percent the FBI report said.
The crime rate in the West and South declined nearly 3 percent while the Midwest saw a drop of 2 percent.
The FBI report also said the rate of property crimes burglaries and larceny fell 3 percent while the rate of motor vehicle thefts dropped 4 percent.
The report noted that 65 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty during 1997 nine more than in 1996.
Of the slain officers 34 worked for city police departments 20 for county police and sheriff s offices 9 for state agencies and 2 for federal agencies.
In 1997 the South was by far the most dangerous region for law enforcement officers.
Thirty two officers were killed in that part of the country last year twice as many as next highest region the West where 15 officers were slain.
Eleven officers were killed in the Midwest and seven in the Northeast.
CHICAGO (AP) Chicago is the nation s 1998 murder capital despite experiencing a 10 year low in murders according to preliminary data from cities nationwide.
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998 surpassing New York City s homicide totals for the first time ever.
New York has seen a dramatic drop in its homicides.
When looked at per capita Chicago s 1998 homicide rate is more than double that of New York.
The bad news comes at a time when Chicago is witnessing a drop in murders.
The last year murders numbered less than 700 was 1988 when there were 663.
One murder is too many but we are always pleased when the numbers go down Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said.
He credited the city s community policing program for much of the decline.
But once the final numbers are in Chicago is expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest U.
Although the city s violent crime rate has dropped consistently in last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 1997) it still lags behind the other largest cities.
In that same period New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.
It is upsetting and very disturbing that we have now passed New York City in the number of murders.
said Arthur Lurigio chairman of the criminal justice department at Loyola University.
I am at a loss as to why Chicago s reductions are not commensurate to other large cities.
Poverty levels in Chicago could account for some of the statistics said James Alan Fox dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston.
Meanwhile Chicago police officials hope their efforts will eventually pay off.
We are making a long term investment in our communities making them places where neighbors feel safe and criminals feel unwelcome Chicago Police Supt.
This process may take a little longer but the long term rewards are great steadily declining crime rates and increased quality of life.

EXISTING GUN LAWS ARE ENFORCED AGGRESSIVELY AND RICHMOND S HOMICIDE RATE DIVES.
Here on the streets of Virginia s capital Melvin Douglas Smith was known for his luck as much as his troublemaking.
For all the charges brought against him in state courts over a decade from larceny and resisting arrest to illegal firearms and murder none stuck.
When a patrol officer pulled him over for a traffic violation in 1997 the officer looked in the car and found 12 grams of crack cocaine a 12 gauge shotgun and a 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol.
The combination of guns and drugs was his undoing.
Under a new program aimed at gun offenders called Project Exile prosecutors were able to charge Smith in the tougher federal system.
As cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets Project Exile is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime rates in Richmond by moving gun offenses into the federal system where bond is less available sentences are longer and convicts are sent out of state to serve their terms.
Project Exile has not only helped to reduce crime in Richmond but it has also brought together officials from other cities and the National Rifle Association in an expanding experiment to see whether violent crime can be reduced by aggressively enforcing laws already on the books rather than fighting over new laws.
While the Justice Department long an adversary of the rifle association over gun control has held back from recommending Project Exile as a cure all and a panel of federal judges in Richmond has criticized it as a federal intrusion into state matters Philadelphia and Rochester N.
have adopted versions of the program and more than a dozen other cities are considering it.
While homicide rates have dropped across the country for a variety of reasons the authorities in Richmond contend that Project Exile helped cut their rate of homicides by firearms by 36 percent last year to 78 homicides from 122 in 1997 one of the steepest declines in any city.
The program has also helped the authorities solve older cases.
Once Smith was sentenced for example witnesses no longer afraid of him came forward with enough information to charge him with six murders including two that could bring the death penalty.
In Richmond there has been an intense need for people to become believers in their own community Mayor Timothy M.
But Project Exile is driving the crime rate down and that is starting to make Richmonders believers again.
Patterned after federal efforts to fight illegal drug activities the program evolved from a determination to prosecute gun charges in federal courts where the stakes are higher for defendants than in state courts even though federal courts generally regard gun violations as low level crimes.
Many gun offenses become federal as well as state crimes when they are coupled with other offenses like drug possession or when the person arrested is a convicted felon an illegal alien a mental patient a drug addict a fugitive the subject of a criminal indictment or a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence.
As a key element of Project Exile a coalition of business and civic leaders has cooperated with the police by saturating the area with radio and television messages billboards and posters warning that anyone caught with an illegal weapon faces a jail term of five years.
Project Exile is so well known on the street said David E.
A lot of them can t add two and two but they know a gun plus drugs equals five.
attorney here who conceived the program said the first two years of Project Exile have led to the recovery of 475 illegal guns indictments against 404 people on gun charges a conviction rate of 86 percent through trials and plea bargains and an average prison term of more than four and a half years.
And Richmond police officers say the program is convincing some would be criminals to leave their weapons at home.
We re now finding more guns in houses than on the street said Michael J.
Shamus an acting lieutenant on the police department s Rapid Mobilization Team.
Still not everyone is convinced that Project Exile is the appropriate means to attack the gun problem.
In a recent court ruling all three judges of the federal District Court here criticized the program as a substantial federal incursion into a sovereign state s area of authority and responsibility.
And the Justice Department has remained reluctant to promote it as a national solution to gun violence.
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said recently that department officials take issue with the notion that there is a cookie cutter approach to reducing gun violence and added Exile worked in Richmond and can work in other places but you have to look at the local situation the situation in every city to decide exactly what will work.
Holder also said the department had sent additional federal marshals agents and prosecutors to make Exile a successful program.
nn Schiller conceded that more federal agents had been sent to Richmond.
But he insisted that the only federal participants dedicated to Project Exile outside of the U.
Attorney s office are two agents on loan from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and one from the FBI.
Others say the involvement of the NRA which has opposed federal gun control laws has tempered the Justice Department s interest.
The rifle association has contributed 125 000 to Richmond s efforts and has lobbied Congress to get 2.
attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia said I can t answer that as a fact but I suspect it is true.
They consider these nuisance cases and the last thing federal judges want are armed felony cases in their courts he said.
Killing people is wrong and regardless of the NRA it needs to be changed.
Rendell led the effort to establish a Project Exile after a challenge last summer by the NRA to give us one major American city to prove that aggressive law enforcement can make a bigger difference than more laws that restrict gun ownership.
Just two days after the city s version of Project Exile called Operation Cease Fire was announced 15 indictments were returned.
In Rochester where a program similar to Richmond s was begun in late September to supplement other new crime fighting initiatives no homicides were reported in November and just two in December.
I can t say that everything is attributable to our Project Exile it s a little early for that said Denise E.
Police officers on Richmond s streets seem thankful for the help no matter who provides it.
Oliver was hired as chief of police in 1994 Richmond had had a decade of increasing numbers of homicides peaking that year at 160.
We desperately needed a home run something to celebrate he said.
As police chief I see Project Exile as one of those programs that is working.
THE WAR ON DRUGS RETREATS STILL TAKING PRISONERS.
Every 20 seconds someone in the United States is arrested for a drug violation.
Every week on average a new jail or prison is built to lock up more people in the world s largest penal system.
Ten years ago half as many people were arrested for drug crimes and the nation s incarceration rate was closer to those of other democracies.
But in the 1980s crack cocaine scared the country and the criminal justice system has never been the same.
As heavily armed gangs fought over turf murder rates shot up.
Authorities warned that crack was instantly addictive and spreading rapidly and predicted that a generation of crack babies would bear the drug s imprint.
But for all the havoc wreaked by crack the worst fears were not realized.
Crack appealed mainly to hard core drug users.
The number of crack users began falling not long after surveys began counting them.
A decade later the violence of the crack trade has burned out and murder rates have plunged.
Yet crack left its mark in ways that few people anticipated.
Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws lock up a record number of people and shift money from schools to prisons.
It transformed police work hospitals parental rights courts.
Crack also changed the racial makeup of U.
More whites than blacks use crack according to surveys but as the war on drugs focused on poor city neighborhoods blacks went to prison at a far higher rate.
In California five black men are behind bars for each one in a state university.
But the harsh laws responding to crack have not reduced overall drug use.
And now the ceaseless march of new drug offenders and the mounting costs of prisons are moving some of the people charged with enforcing the punitive laws to question the assumptions behind them.
We have a failed social policy and it has to be re evaluated said Barry McCaffrey the four star general who heads the National Drug Control Policy Office.
More than a quarter million Americans in prison for drug offenses could be better dealt with in treatment programs he said saving up to 5 billion a year.
Since 1985 the nation s jail and prison population has grown 130 percent and it will soon pass 2 million even as crime rates continue a six year decline.
No country has more people behind bars and only one Russia has a higher incarceration rate according to the Sentencing Project which tracks prison rates.
Behind the increase is a national get tough mood that has produced longer sentences for all criminals and the end of parole in many states.
Polls show that most Americans favor lengthy terms for violent criminals.
But perhaps the biggest single factor is the systematic jailing of drug offenders.
In the first 10 years after Congress toughened drug laws in response to crack the number of people imprisoned for drugs grew more than 400 percent nearly twice the growth rate for violent criminals.
More people are behind bars for drug offenses in the United States about 400 000 than are in prison for all crimes in England France Germany and Japan combined.
Crack s legacy can be seen in nearly every corner of the land even in the Mojave Desert where the newest federal prison is rising at the dusty edge of Victorville.
In an age of government downsizing the federal corrections budget has grown more than tenfold in a decade to nearly 4 billion yet prisons are so stuffed with drug offenders that this one will be at capacity almost from the day it opens.
that high incarceration rates deserve the credit for falling crime rates.
Putting people in prison has been the single most important thing we ve done to reduce crime Dr.
Wilson the political scientist whose ideas have influenced police departments for a generation has written.
In New York the police and prosecutors say locking up thousands of drug offenders was a major factor in the city s turning the corner on crime.
What plays havoc with a neighborhood are the low level dealers said Bridget Brennan the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for New York.
When they take over a street or a stoop everyone else is terrified.
When you put those people in jail it gives the community a sense that order has been restored.
What the prison boom has not done however is reduce illicit drug use national surveys show.
Far fewer Americans use illegal drugs now than in the peak years of the 1970s.
But almost all of the drop occurred before crack cocaine or the laws passed in response to it.
The most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1997 estimated that about 14 million people had used an illegal drug in the last month a number barely changed since 1988.
Of those 600 000 had smoked crack within a month unchanged since 1988.
What s happened across the board is that police started going after small time street dealers and users said Dr.
Steven Belenko a criminologist at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
Crack never became a mainstream drug but the fear of it changed perception and laws for virtually all illicit drugs according to Belenko and others who have studied the war on drugs.
Crack probably had more impact on the entire criminal justice system than it had on the communities and the drug users said Dr.
Franklin Zimring director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California School of Law.
This secondary impact on police and prisons may end up being more negative than anything associated with the drug.
Among governors teachers criminologists and police chiefs there is vigorous debate over how the drug laws enacted at the height of the crack panic have transformed the nation.
But in Congress which enacted the laws without a single hearing there is nothing.
For crack has left one other major legacy.
The policy discussion in Washington on prisons and drugs has been frozen for more than a decade.
nn The Evidence As Crime Rate Falls More Prisons Are Built The little towns tucked into the folds of the Appalachian Mountains in Schuylkill County Pa.
are a world removed from the city streets where crack cocaine was a media obsession in the mid 1980s.
A first year teacher there can expect to make 18 500 a year the state mandated minimum.
The job of watching over the drug offenders and others who are filling three new state prisons in the region is coveted.
Pennsylvania might not seem the kind of place where prisons and jails would be booming.
Crime has never been a particularly big problem.
among the states Pennsylvania has ranked near the bottom.
But every year for the last 14 years Pennsylvania has added at least one prison and the corrections budget has soared to more than 1 billion a year a fivefold increase over a decade.
In 1988 not long before President George Bush spoke to the nation about the war on drugs while holding up a bag of crack Pennsylvania radically changed its drug laws establishing mandatory minimum sentences for people caught with illicit drugs.
Pennsylvania was following the lead of Congress which had set the nation on a course of strict incarceration for drug users with laws enacted in 1986 and 1988.
Ten years later its inmate population had grown 225 percent to 35 600.
Pennsylvania spends an average of 20 000 a year for each one about the national average.
Tom Ridge a Republican has no plans to change the incarceration policy.
Every public expenditure comes with a choice said his spokesman Tim Reeves.
The crime rate might not be so low if the state had not locked up so many drug offenders Reeves said.
Think about the cost to the community the wasted lives and violent crime.
But in building a penal system in which three of every 10 new prisoners are serving time for drugs according to the Pennsylvania Sentencing Commission which tracks prison rates for the state Pennsylvania like most states has not reduced illegal drug use.
I don t think anybody believes it has turned out to be an effective policy said David Sweet a Harrisburg lawyer who headed a special commission that examined the state s prison growth.
It appeared to us that we were using a very expensive way to provide secure housing for people who probably don t belong in prison.
Julia Glover Hall a criminologist at Drexel University and president of the Pennsylvania Prison Society which Benjamin Franklin established to monitor prisons and jails said.
We re locking up all these nonviolent offenders pouring money down a rat hole.
There was this powerful scare in the crack years and all across the country we passed these Draconian laws.
Now we re starting to see how much it has cost the rest of us.
Pennsylvania is typical of what has happened across the country.
California is spending nearly 4 billion a year to operate the nation s largest prison system.
As the state added 21 prisons since 1984 and only one university campus violent criminals fell to 42 percent of the prison population in 1997 from 57 percent while drug inmates grew to 27 percent from 8 percent.
Political leaders have debated whether the building boom was at the expense of their budget s other big discretionary item higher education.
Many politicians said the state would try to fully finance both.
Spending on prisons has grown 60 percent over a decade and pay for prison guards has more than doubled.
For higher education there was virtually no growth and salaries in the state university system stagnated falling behind other states.
A prison guard now makes about 51 000 a year while a first year professor in California s once vaunted university system is paid 41 000.
As the prison budget swelled California raised tuition to make up the university financing gap.
Over the last 10 years as the state s population grew by 5 million people state university enrollment fell by 20 000.
The shift in priorities documented in a number of studies has become a major issue since a new governor Gray Davis and a new Legislature took office.
Most of our buildings are literally falling apart and we ve lost 1 500 full time faculty members said Jeri Bledsoe general manager of the California Faculty Association.
The Convicted 40 Worth of Cocaine Brings a Life Sentence The biggest legacy of crack is out of sight behind the concrete and steel of prisons.
Addicts couriers girlfriends of dealers people tempted by the lure of a quick buck mostly poor blacks these are the dominant profiles of the people jailed since prisons started filling with drug criminals.
Inside the maximum security unit at the state prison for women in Topeka Kan.
Gloria Van Winkle is in the sixth year of a life term for possessing 40 worth of cocaine.
A mother of two and a drug addict she had two convictions for cocaine possession when a convicted thief told undercover agents she was smoking crack and they set up a sting.
Asked about her case the state Sentencing Commission said no one was doing life for drug possession.
Only murderers get life sentences in Kansas said its executive director Barbara Tombs.
Tombs found that yes for a brief period in the early 90s a person convicted of three drug offenses could get life.
I can t laugh anymore I can t cry it s just a slow rage that makes me numb Ms.
Her sentence offers an eventual chance of parole but for now she lives for visits from her children ages 10 and 6 and wonders what they will grow up to be like with her behind bars.
Three fourths of the 54 000 women jailed for drug crimes have children.
Van Winkle should have been aware of the possibility of a life sentence.
They said she was chosen because they thought she might lead them to dealers but no follow up arrests were made.
Because of three strikes laws and other changes made in the last decade people in several other states are serving life sentences for drug possession.
More typical among women convicted of drug offenses are 5 and 10 year mandatory terms.
Tonya Drake a mother of four had no criminal record or history of drug use when she was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for mailing a package that contained crack cocaine.
She says a friend paid her 44 to mail the package which she did not know contained drugs.
But the time does not fit the crime she said in a prison interview.
While I m here my father dies my children grow up it cost thousands of dollars to keep me behind bars.
The children are having considerable trouble growing up with their mother in prison said Ms.
Tonya was taken away from the kids at a time when everybody needed her Ms.
When the children see their mother in the prison visiting room Ms.
I tell my kids I did something wrong that it was a mistake she said.
In Kentucky Louie Cordell a 55 year old father of nine with no prior convictions is finishing a mandatory five year federal sentence for growing 141 marijuana plants.
Cordell was sent to prison under the 1986 law that set mandatory five and 10 year sentences for the possession or sale of small amounts of crack.
For marijuana the law set a mandatory sentence of five years for possession of 100 plants whether they were seedlings or 6 feet tall.
That provision has since been changed to go by weight.
The law punished Cordell but it hit his family just as hard.
He worked seasonally at a sawmill in a poor county in southeastern Kentucky and was growing the marijuana to help make ends meet said his wife Shirley.
Since Cordell went to prison a son gave up plans to attend college on a scholarship in order to help support the family and the Cordells have been on and off welfare.
There s no way to describe what s happened to us except to say that it s been bad in all ways Mrs.
Louie was here providing for us and then they took him away.
Marijuana was never mentioned in the floor speeches in Congress when the drug laws were rewritten in 1986 but the new penalties for crack were accompanied by harsher sentences for most drugs.
Ten years later more people were sentenced under the federal system for marijuana than for any other drug.
Supporters of harsh penalties argue that locking up the Louie Cordells of the world has a deterrent effect and say convictions reduce other crimes associated with drug use.
Marijuana arrests set a record in 1997 695 200 nearly 90 percent of which were for simple possession.
And marijuana remains by far the most popular illegal drug.
18 million Americans used marijuana at least once in 1997 according to the National Household Survey.
And some 71 million 33 percent of those over age 12 have used marijuana at some time.
Asked about deterrence the federal prosecutor in Cordell s case David Marye said marijuana cultivation does not seem to have diminished in rural Kentucky.
I ve been prosecuting cases state and federal for 21 years and we have so many people who keep doing what Louie Cordell was doing that it makes you wonder if we ll ever stop them he said.
The Cities Racial Implications of the Crack Laws One of every 20 Americans born this year will serve time in prison according to a Justice Department study.
3 percent of black men age 25 to 29 were inmates compared with 0.
But the criminal justice system s special treatment of crack cocaine dramatically threw off the balance according to reports by the Sentencing Commission and the Justice Department.
For people convicted of a crack offense the world of justice is unlike any other.
But federal law equates 5 grams of crack with 500 grams of powder cocaine a 1 to 100 ratio that no other country recognizes.
Possessing 5 grams of crack is a felony with an automatic five year prison term while 5 grams of the same drug in powder form is a misdemeanor likely to carry no jail time.
One consequence of the disparity is that kingpins at the top of a drug network who sell pounds of powder cocaine for processing often serve less time than street level dealers who sell grams of crack.
One of the great victims of the drug war is that our sense of penal proportion has been thrown out said Zimring of the University of California School of Law.
In addition a law aimed at one type of drug use has been applied most often against one type of user urban blacks.
A higher percentage of blacks use crack cocaine than whites or Hispanic people.
But in absolute numbers twice as many whites as blacks use crack and three times as many whites as blacks use powder cocaine the national household survey shows.
As the war on drugs set up special penalties on crack however law enforcement focused on the highly visible often violent crack trade in city neighborhoods rather than the larger traffic in cocaine going on behind closed doors across the country.
Nearly 90 percent of the people locked up for crack under federal drug laws are black McCaffrey said.
In state prisons blacks make up nearly 60 percent of the people serving time on drug offenses according to Justice Department figures though they are only 12 percent of the general population and 15 percent of regular drug users.
I don t think we got into this fix because of racism McCaffrey said.
The impact of crack on the African American community was devastating.
The racial disparity would disappear if the law treated the powder and crack forms of cocaine equally said Dr.
Douglas McDonald a senior scientist at Abt Associates a social policy research group in Cambridge Mass.
If enforcement were evenly applied more whites than blacks would go to prison he said.
nn So for many blacks the legacy of crack is not just the violence and high prison rates that have hit so many communities but a heightened sense that the law does not treat them fairly.
You have so many people who feel hopeless who feel that it is extremely unfair that so many low level offenders are going to jail for such a long time said Mattie Compton a black community leader in Fort Worth Texas who is deputy chief assistant U.
We know we re going to lose people in poor neighborhoods but when you see people who are prospects for future leaders going away to jail for so long you wonder if we really are a community under siege Ms.
Asked about the legacy of crack in the Roxbury district of Boston where he works with drug addicts at a community health center Seward Hunter said.
If you re African American you expect to be targeted by the police and you expect to be stopped and searched.
Many in Congress say there is no racial intent behind the disparity between crack and powder.
Crack is punished more severely because of the harm it does and because of the violent crimes associated with it.
No one should forget that crack traffickers deal in death and that they do so to the most vulnerable among us the residents of our inner cities said Rep.
Congress Responds How Congress came to write a law that allows a person caught with 400 grams of powder cocaine worth some 40 000 to do less than a year in jail while a person holding the same amount of cocaine in crack form will spend 10 years in prison is a mystery to people who have tried to research the statutory intent.
One lawyer who was instrumental in rewriting the drug laws in 1986 and 1988 says it came about through whim and attempts by politicians to one up each other as crack seized headlines just before elections.
There was a level of hysteria that led to a total breakdown of the legislative process said the lawyer Eric Sterling who as a lead lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee wrote the laws that established long mandatory terms for several drugs.
Since leaving the Judiciary Committee in 1989 Sterling has worked to overturn the laws as president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in Washington.
In the summer of 1986 crack was just starting to be labeled as an epidemic when a college basketball star Len Bias died of a drug overdose reportedly crack cocaine.
Speaker Tip O Neill whose hometown team the Boston Celtics had drafted Bias ordered an overhaul of federal drug laws.
The death of Bias was invoked in Congress 11 times.
The law the Anti Drug Abuse Act of 1986 passed the House with only 16 dissenting votes.
Despite complaints by some senators that no one had studied the bill it sailed through the Senate and President Ronald Reagan signed it before Election Day.
A year later court testimony revealed that Bias had died of an overdose of powder cocaine not crack.
But by then crack had its special status in state and federal law.
Crack was singled out for good reason according to Edwin Meese the attorney general in the mid 1980s and now the Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow of Public Policy at the Heritage Foundation a conservative research organization in Washington.
Crack cocaine was the scourge of the inner city he said.
The reason laws were changed was to protect the inner city.
In 1988 Congress passed another overhaul of drug laws just before the election singling out crack as the only drug to carry a mandatory five year prison term for possession.
That year a Gallup poll found that 62 percent of Americans surveyed agreed that to curb drug use they would be willing to give up some freedoms.
Crack was on the cover of news magazines dominated television and newspaper coverage and was labeled America s drug of choice by NBC.
The New York Times reported that crack was spreading to the suburbs.
William Bennett the drug czar for 18 months under President Bush said it might soon invade every home in America.
Crack was compared to the bubonic plague and called the most addictive drug known to man in Newsweek.
Today few of the revisionist experts on drug laws dispute crack s link to violence and gangs.
But crack was never America s drug of choice it did not come close.
At the height of concern in the late 1980s the National Household Survey on Drugs estimated that less than one half of 1 percent of the population over age 12 used crack once a month while 10 percent used marijuana.
And three out of four high school seniors who tried crack did not continue to use it according to a national survey of students by the University of Michigan.
Both surveys have flaws underestimating inner city users and high school dropouts.
But even after the findings for high use in certain urban areas are adjusted crack was never the epidemic it was held up to be.
The media attention was so hyperbolic that the Drug Enforcement Administration was compelled to correct the record.
Crack is currently the subject of considerable media attention the agency said in 1986.
The result has been a distortion of the public perception of the extent of crack use as compared to the use of other drugs.
Although crack was labeled the world s most addictive drug 10 years of national surveys have shown that most people who try crack do not continue to use it.
Because of its intense but short lived effect crack does tend to make its users psychologically dependent reported a Justice Department study.
But numerous studies have shown that crack like the powder form of cocaine may be less physically addictive than alcohol or tobacco.
The Pyramid Lower Level Dealers Feel the Sting of Laws Political leaders said harsh sentencing laws were intended to deter use of the most dangerous drugs with crack at the top of the list.
Failing that they said the laws would at least go after drug kingpins.
But statistics show a different pattern among people sentenced to prison for drugs since 1986.
Of the people jailed by the federal government for crack offenses only 5 percent were considered high level dealers according to a study by the Sentencing Commission.
The current policy focuses law enforcement efforts on the lowest level of the distribution line the street level dealer the commission s vice chairman Michael Gelacak wrote.
Unless we ignore all evidence to the contrary the current policy has little or no impact upon the drug abuse problem.
nn Supporters of the crack laws say the numbers are explained by the pyramid structure of drug operations.
by nature they have few people at the top lots of people at the bottom.
But those at the top are often dealing powder cocaine with its vastly different penalties.
And they are in a position to become informers the only real hope of beating a mandatory prison term.
Had Tonya Drake the woman serving 10 years for mailing a package been able to supply what the law labels substantial assistance information on a high level dealer she might have reduced her sentence.
The 1980s drug laws leave discretion in the hands of prosecutors to encourage people to snitch.
Drake identified the man who gave her the package but he was never found.
The fixed sentences have infuriated judges who say they feel their role has been reduced to that of rubber stamps for prosecutors while their courts are clogged with low to medium level drug offenders.
When you re dealing with first time offenders you should have some discretion said Lawrence Irving a former federal judge from San Diego.
I had cases where I was forced to give more jail time for low level offenders than for the kingpins.
District Court judge labeled his sentencings a farce as he sent the lowest and least culpable member of a big crack operation to prison for longer than a supplier at the top.
Monica Boguille the 20 year old mother of a baby girl was sentenced to 10 years for occasionally counting money for her boyfriend a crack dealer.
Godfrey one of the ring s wholesale suppliers of cocaine who was deemed helpful to prosecutors received nine years.
Supreme Court said recently that federal judges should regain some of the discretion they once had.
Five years ago Chief Justice William Rehnquist made similar points in condemning the mandatory minimum sentences established by Congress.
Dozens of federal judges most of them former prosecutors have taken a strong stand against mandatory minimum drug sentences.
For these judges the most significant legacy of crack is a legal system that has left them as little more than spectators in their own courtrooms.
The Aftermath The Penalties Outlive Fear of an Epidemic McCaffrey says he came to the drug debate with an open mind but has become convinced that current policies with the primary emphasis on imprisonment are failing.
The current system is bad drug policy and bad law enforcement he said.
On cost alone arresting prosecuting and locking up all drug criminals at the price of about 35 billion a year is not effective he said.
He now favors long sentences for dealers and treatment for low level users.
concluded that mandatory jail terms are the least cost effective way of reducing cocaine consumption.
For violent crimes long sentences keep criminals off the street it reported but for drug crimes a jailed supplier is often replaced by another supplier.
Drug treatment also has a low success rate.
among regular users of cocaine who undergo treatment only one in eight stops.
But even that would achieve a greater reduction in cocaine use at a fraction of the cost than prison the Rand study stated.
We misread a lot what was going on in the 1980s in that we thought crack use was going to grow and take over society said Dr.
Jonathan Caulkins a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who conducted the study.
The real tragedy is that now that it s clear that crack was not the epidemic it was supposed to be we still have these laws.
But few authorities on crime expect the laws to change no matter how full the prisons become.
For politicians the drug debate is driven by the three R s retribution revenge retaliation and that leads to the fourth R re election said Dr.
James Alan Fox dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
This month the Clinton administration announced a plan to cut drug use in half by 2007.
After years of reduced federal financing for drug rehabilitation it would increase money for treating addicts.
The war metaphor has been dropped by the White House and by some in Congress as well.
But the emphasis on long mandatory prison terms and locking up small time dealers remains the main strategy for Congress.
I believe it is crucial given our continuing struggle in the war on drugs that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all Americans and our children in particular that the sale of illegal drugs is dangerous wrong and will not be tolerated said Sen.
Abraham has introduced a bill that would establish much longer sentences for people convicted of powder cocaine offenses making them closer to crack.
All that bill would do is lock up a bigger batch of small fry said Julie Stewart a former member of the conservative Cato Institute who founded Families Against Mandatory Minimums after her brother was sent to prison on a marijuana conviction.
But with polls showing that most Americans favor long prison terms for drug trafficking attempts to persuade Congress to reconsider the laws have gone nowhere.
Sentiment has remained the same for nearly a decade dating to a time when some politicians predicted that the United States could be drug free by the year 2000.
government will release new figures showing how many Americans are behind bars and the numbers will reveal that the bull market for prisons is still charging ahead.
Nearly 1 of every 150 people in the United States is in prison or jail the Justice Department will announce a figure that no other democracy comes close to matching.
Soon the total number of people locked up in federal and state prisons and local jails will likely reach the 2 million mark almost double the number a decade ago as the ranks of prisoners grow enough each year to fill Yankee Stadium and then some.
For an American born this year the chance of living some part of life in a correction facility is 1 in 20.
Most experts failed to predict that the inmate population would triple from 1980 and now nobody seems to know how to stop the buildup.
By all logic prisons should be experiencing a few vacancies and the cost of arresting prosecuting and putting away an army of criminals should be at ebb.
After all the economy could hardly be better and crime has fallen steeply six years in a row.
At what point does the world s largest penal system hit a plateau 2.
Surely if crime continues to fall the number of new prisoners must also fall.
No matter how much crime plummets the United States will still have to add the equivalent of a new 1 000 bed jail or prison every week for perhaps another decade federal officials say.
Some even believe the prison boom could be permanent at least for another generation.
A big reason is that so many of the new inmates are drug offenders.
In the federal system nearly 60 percent of all people behind bars are doing time for drug violations.
in state prisons and local jails the figure is 22 percent.
Americans do not use more drugs on average than people in other nations.
but the United States virtually alone among Western democracies has chosen a path of incarceration for drug offenders.
More than 400 000 people are behind bars for drug crimes and nearly a third of them are locked up for simply possessing an illicit drug.
Barry McCaffrey the nation s drug czar calls the expanding mass of drug inmates.
But a growing number of them have broken no laws other than the ones on drug use.
In the 1980s Congress and the states passed drug laws that required judges to put people in prison even first time offenders or those caught with small amounts of an illicit substance.
Mandatory minimum sentences as they are called leave no room for a judge to consider special circumstances or options such as treatment instead of jail.
The idea was that more arrests would lead to more convictions which would put more people in jail and the crime rate would fall.
Another dividend was supposed to be a drop in drug use but that has not happened.
Arrests of people who use drugs just hit an all time high the FBI reported.
At the same time drug use has gone up among the young and for drugs like heroin or methamphetamines.
For virtually all other crimes of course the figures are stunning with huge drops in murder robbery and assault.
Whether this is because the United States will soon have 2 million people locked up is subject to much debate.
But many of the authorities who argue that the prison boom has taken the worst criminals out of circulation and has thus been the biggest factor in reducing crime are at a loss to explain the drug use figures.
I am in favor of the federal government ceasing and desisting the war on drugs said Dr.
Morgan Reynolds director of the Criminal Justice Center at the Dallas branch of the National Center for Policy Analysis a free market think tank.
He described himself as being on the conservative side of the debate over prisons and crime.
he says the crime drop can be directly attributed to the prison boom.
But he is less sure that the federal government s war on drugs has an effect on crime rates and drug use.
For liberals and libertarians who have long claimed incarceration has failed to do anything but run up the bill in the drug war conservative cover is welcome.
introduced a bill to restore discretion for judges in sentencing low level nonviolent drug offenders.
We may be getting to the point of diminishing returns the more you expand the prison system the more small fry you put in there said Marc Mauer assistant director of the Sentencing Project a nonprofit group that has been critical of the prison buildup.
Even some of the architects of punitive drug policies now argue that stuffing the prisons with ever more drug offenders is not a wise investment.
Edwin Meese who was attorney general under President Ronald Reagan when most of the drug laws were rewritten has started to look favorably on treatment for low level offenders rather than jail.
I think mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders ought to be reviewed said Meese in an interview.
Beyond the laws that send drug offenders to prison with reflexive certainty there are now institutional incentives to keep locking up more people a trend that some people call the prison industrial complex.
nn The stock price of the Corrections Corporation of America the nation s largest private jailer has increased tenfold since 1994.
has created a popular real estate investment fund to get a return on all those new prisons being built at the rate of one a week.
Unions representing prison guards are the fastest growing public employee associations in many states.
In California last year the union was given a raise of 12 percent which brought the salary for a seasoned prison guard up to 51 000.
It is the rare rural community that rejects a new prison in its backyard with the prospect of permanent high paying benefit rich government jobs.
The prisons in California as in virtually every other state are near capacity even though the state has built 21 new institutions in the last 15 years.
Soon it will cost nearly 4 billion a year to run the state s prison system.
Should the Legislature propose some change in the law that might bring down the growth in prisons they are likely to hear howls of outrage from the union that has most benefited from the growth in prisons.
Once you have a society committed to building new prisons and keeping them it s very difficult to close them down said Mauer.
The states also have an incentive to keep people in jail a long time.
A federal law passed in 1994 provides matching funds to states to keep violent criminals in prison longer by denying parole.
This act and other so called truth in sentencing laws are reasons why the ranks of prisoners will not soon drop even as crime levels off.
We ve got crime going in one direction and social policy going in the other said Dr.
Allen Beck the Justice Department s lead statistician on criminal justice trends.
The one thing that may finally slow prison growth said Beck are budget concerns.
It costs taxpayers 20 000 a year to house and feed every new inmate and that does not include the cost of building new prisons and jails.
The states are spending nearly 30 billion to keep people in jail about double the rate of 10 years ago.
California legislative leaders say they will build no new prisons in coming years but they have not said what they will do with excess prisoners.
In Washington state a bill that would abolish mandatory minimum prison terms for drug offenders has gained support from judges prosecutors and tough on crime Republicans.
Washington was a pioneer state in enacting laws requiring long lockups with no chance of early release or leeway for judges to consider other options.
But prisons now are the state s fastest growing part of the budget even as crime has nearly bottomed out.
But it will be difficult to change the pattern with new prisons rising in depressed rural areas.
Cleaning up after a crusade some lawmakers said has proven much harder than they anticipated.
Clinton Orders Federal State Anti Gun Strategy.
President Bill Clinton ordered his government Saturday to develop a plan for closer federal state cooperation to increase prosecution of criminals who use firearms and to take other steps aimed at reducing gun violence.
In his weekly radio address Clinton claimed the country s crime rate has dropped by more than 20 percent since 1993 and the rate of murders by firearms has fallen by 33 percent.
But he said that far too many people still are killed by guns.
Clinton said adding that disarming criminals should be the top priority.
Clinton put Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and Attorney General Janet Reno in charge of developing a strategy against gun violence.
attorney in Richmond in cooperation with state local and other federal officials.
Clinton said hundreds of firearms have been seized and hundreds of criminals who used firearms convicted.
The key to the project he said is using existing federal laws as the backbone of the enforcement effort.
Clinton repeated what his budget for the next fiscal year is proposing to help cut firearm related crime including 5 million U.
8 million dollars for more than 120 new agents of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.
LOS ANGELES Keeping kids off the streets of the northeast San Fernando Valley through a nighttime curfew has helped drive down burglary and robbery rates there to the lowest citywide police say.
The Los Angeles Police Department s Foothill Division hands out twice as many curfew citations as other divisions and it was the only one with a decline in violent crime during the first three months of this year.
It s a lot of juveniles who burglarize cars and instigate a lot of violent crimes on the streets said Foothill Division Capt.
The division s property crime rate fell by 25 percent dramatically below other Valley divisions.
The Valley s top police officer Deputy Chief Mike Bostic said tough enforcement of the curfew wouldn t necessarily work as well elsewhere in the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown.
The ordinance doesn t work as much in places like North Hollywood where the crime patterns show it s more adults causing problems Bostic said.
I tell the division commanders to use whatever tools they can to reduce crime.
However the numbers seem to tell a different story.
Property crimes which police say are largely caused by juveniles are down only 4.
Rick Wahler said his officers enforced the curfew aggressively and the juvenile crime problem stopped so now there is no need to continue regular patrols.
It didn t make sense to have officers patrol areas where the problem had diminished Wahler said.
They continue to enforce the curfew on regular patrols but we don t do any more special enforcements.
Violent crime in North Hollywood increased 6.
5 percent caused by a surge in domestic violence Wahler said.
In the Van Nuys Division officers have focused on stemming school truancy rather than enforcing nighttime curfews said Detective Craig Rhudy.
At night he said officers are too busy with emergency calls to deal with curfew violators.
The property crime rate in Rhudy s division declined 8.
I think our crime rate would decline even further if we spent more time on the curfew Wahler said.
Nationwide studies show that when police enforce the curfew crime drops said Daniel Glaser a University of Southern California professor who specializes in juvenile crime and crime prevention.
There s more kids getting in trouble these days and if police are there to send them home there s no trouble Glaser said.
Yet the Los Angeles ACLU questions whether curfew enforcement decreases crime said Liz Schroeder associate director of the Los Angeles chapter.
It s easy to attribute crime drops to things like the curfew but it s really jobs and the economy that play a big role she said.
Sixteen year old Jaime Orosco who likes to hang out in Hubert H.
Humphrey Memorial Park laments the fact that his park loitering freedom slips away as the sun sets over Lake View Terrace.
You can t go out at night without getting hassled anymore said Orosco.
Most curfews for minors have been upheld in state and federal courts despite protests from parents kids and civil rights groups that say the rules are discriminatory and don t include enough exceptions.
Supreme Court action of its kind involving curfews justices allowed police in Charlottesville Va.
to continue enforcing their ordinance despite claims the law deprived minors and their parents of their freedoms.
Schroeder also says there appear to be biases against minorities in areas where the curfew is enforced heavily.
Generally we feel that curfew ordinances are enforced disproportionately in minority areas like in the Foothill Division instead of white areas Schroeder said.
The ordinances should be done in a way that they don t interfere with the rights of kids and they aren t used as an excuse to harass.
That argument makes sense to Orosco s 19 year old friend David Misa even though he s of legal age.
Sometimes we like to cruise around and just kick it you know on Friday and Saturday Misa said.
But the cops come and bug us and it gets broken up.
Some people won t even come out because they don t want to get hassled.
Heavy enforcement has nothing to do with race Garner said.
It s about auto thefts burglaries and gang violence attributed to the region s Pacoima gangsters most of the crimes committed by juveniles.
The curfew has been a great tool especially at places like Humphrey Park where we were having serious gang problems said Foothill gang Detective Bob Brophy.
Since we vigorously started enforcing the curfew the gang problem has dropped.
Apart from the drop in property crimes violent crimes fell by 3 percent while the rest of the Valley s divisions have increased.
Foothill Division has issued more than 3 600 citations since mid 1996 almost double the amount written by other Valley divisions during the same time.
While the curfew ordinance has been on the books for many years it didn t begin having an impact until 1996 when heavy enforcement began said LAPD Juvenile Division Detective David Berglund.
The state changed the penal code in 1996 allowing officers to enforce the ordinance by handing out citations instead of taking kids in and getting wrapped up in delinquency court.
Every juvenile issued a citation must appear in traffic court and penalties range from community service to between 250 and 675 in fines.

DETROIT (AP) The city s murder rate already among the highest in the nation jumped 16.
7 percent in the first half of 1999 baffling city leaders who have watched a decline in the number of other serious crimes.
The city recorded 57 736 serious crimes from January through June a 15.
5 percent while assaults auto thefts burglaries rapes and robberies also declined.
Mayor Dennis Archer and Police Chief Benny Napoleon said they were concerned because there was no clear cause and no obvious solution.
The murder rate in the city of 1 million dropped last year.
I wish we had sufficient police officers that we could put an officer on every corner of the streets where we live Archer said Wednesday.
The reality is that the homicides that are taking place are taking place behind closed doors.
Detroit s murder rate still ranks among the highest in the country.
2 per 100 000 people ranking it sixth among U.
In recent years murder has been the leading cause of death among children and young adults.
Crime has been a sore spot for Detroit leaders for many years.
Safety was often cited as a cause of flight to the suburbs.
poverty and drugs were blamed for driving crime rates up.
Making people feel safe was one of Archer s prime goals when he took office in 1994 and since then Detroit s crime rate has gone down mirroring a national trend.
NEW FIREARMS LAW PUTS CRIMINALS UNDER THE GUN.
FORT WORTH Texas By the end of September the warnings will be up on billboards all over this Texas city.
In Richmond Va the signs carry this message.
An Illegal Gun Gets You Five Years in Federal Prison.
you might read a similar warning on the side of a city bus.
You (plus) illegal gun (equals) federal prison.
Behind the tough messages is a new approach to curbing gun violence that is being adopted by cities around the country where officials are eager to duplicate the apparent success of Richmond s 2 year old Project Exile.
Criminals who ignore the advertised warnings and tote guns face tough specialized federal prosecution instead of getting lost in the overwhelmed state courts.
In each city they re selling a promise that if you re caught carrying a weapon in the commission of a crime the local authorities will turn you over to the feds who will use existing law to seek out the longest sentence applicable for your offense.
A convicted felon caught with a gun or anyone caught carrying a gun while trafficking in drugs will usually draw at least five years in a federal penitentiary.
In the federal system repeat offenders get more time federal prisoners serve about 80 percent of their sentences and there is no parole.
There s been a sea change in the criminal community says James B.
Comey criminal division chief in Richmond s U.
Richmond had the second highest murder rate in the country in 1997 the year they mounted Project Exile.
They ended the year with 140 homicides but by the end of 1998 that number had dropped to 94.
The city has recorded only 47 homicides through the first eight months of this year as compared to 67 for the same time period last year.
Richmond was a demoralized city not just in the folks who live here but in the police department.
Exile gets more credit than it deserves some times but it s fired up the cops and fired up the citizens Comey said.
Because the program doesn t require new gun laws and is not gun control in the traditional sense even the National Rifle Association is supporting Project Exile.
That makes it a rare animal a gun program that President Clinton Sarah Brady and the NRA can agree on.
I wish (the Clinton administration) backed this more than the lip service they ve given it said NRA spokesman Bill Powers.
Call it whatever you want but whatever effort goes after armed violent felons on the streets of American cities is something the NRA backs heartily.
Civic leaders are desperate to reduce gun violence in their communities.
Even though the murder rate has fallen dramatically in most major cities in recent years traveling to Richmond to study Project Exile is becoming a civic leader s pilgrimage to Mecca.
There really isn t any rocket science to doing a lot of gun cases says Comey.
The genius to Exile is the advertising because what that has done is sell fear to the potential defendants in ways we never imagined.
It really almost creates a myth in Richmond Comey said.
The advertising people said Look we manipulate culture.
They said Give us a chance to sell fear.
Word of mouth has been important too Comey said.
Bug Smith was a legendary shooter in Richmond.
We popped him with a single gun and he got 16 1 2 years in the fed.
When the word got out that Bug Smith got 16 1 2 years on a gun the reaction was just phenomenal.
Comey quickly agrees there are other factors at play in Richmond that may have affected the murder rate.
For instance Virginia abolished parole in 1994 which means the first wave of criminals put away since then are probably not yet back on the streets.
And the drug trade in his city has shifted away from crack cocaine to heroin which produces less volatile behavior Comey said.
But all the decreases in homicides in Richmond have been in the category of murders by firearm.
Those two clues tell me something has happened in the firearm world of bad guys in Richmond Comey said.
District judges have lambasted Project Exile for crossing the line into a sovereign state s area of authority and responsibility.
Federal prosecution also costs considerably more than state prosecution of similar cases.
And in Richmond criminal attorney David Baugh charges that Project Exile violates the civil rights of Richmond s black residents by sending them in front of federal juries drawn from a larger predominantly white pool.
Federal officials point out however that most Project Exile offenders will never see a jury opting to plea bargain.
The 10th Amendment to the constitution was written to make sure the federal government did not intrude upon those responsibilities held by the states Baugh said And now we have every case and it s momma being handled by the feds.
The federal courts are overcrowded anyway judges who are supposed to be handling the most delicate cases are now doing the equivalent of traffic cases.
Fort Worth s Operation Safe City will work much like Richmond s program as a cooperative approach among the local police department the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and the U.
On a recent afternoon ATF agent Mike Russell delivered his pitch for the program to more than 100 of Fort Worth s Neighborhood Police Officers.
He made it clear that the gun cases will be prosecuted strictly off the arrest reports filed by the local police.
The success of this program is directly proportional to getting these guys prosecuted in the federal system Russell said.
attorney doesn t want cases where we have to come back and interview people.
Their best chance for making a gun case stick is at the point of executing the search warrant he said advising them to write down as much detail as possible about where the gun was found and any comments the suspect makes about the gun.
You talk to them then and they ll probably tell you anything you want to know.
Several Fort Worth officers immediately began asking questions about using the program to get people off the streets who are problems in their neighborhoods.
When Russell got back to his office he had a handful of telephone messages from officers who had specific cases they wanted to pass on for federal prosecution.
Russell has been operating something of a one man Safe City U.
program for the past 18 months wading through Fort Worth Police Department offense reports and pursuing those gun cases he thought he could make stick.
Russell picked up one gun case from an offense report on a man arrested for multiple traffic warrants.
A patrol officer spotted a motorcycle parked between two houses in a residential neighborhood late at night and saw a shortened pistol grip shotgun strapped to the bike.
The officer ran the motorcycle s license tag number and discovered the outstanding traffic warrants.
The officer arrested Nicholas Alexander Martin when he returned to the bike a few minutes later dressed in black a bandolier of shotgun shells strapped to his chest.
He was also carrying a flashlight four feet of telephone cord a four inch lock blade knife and white surgical gloves.
We picked up the (gun) case and he turned out to be a multiconvicted felon in possession of a firearm Russell said.
David Montague a spokesman in the Tarrant County District Attorney s office said Martin probably would have been allowed to plead guilty to 10 years or less had the case stayed in the state system.
And with good time and parole he would serve even less.
The reality is that in the state courts we have so many murders armed robberies child abusers and sex offenders that it s unlikely he would have the maximum Montague said.
When the Safe City program formally kicks off at the end of the month Russell will be aided by six other ATF agents in researching gun cases for prosecution.
When this thing gets rolling we re talking about volume he said.
Volume has been a problem in Richmond where federal prosecutors saw their felony caseload jump from about 139 in 1996 to 404 in 1998 as a result of Project Exile.
The Justice Department is requesting an additional 5 million from Congress to fund about 45 to 50 prosecutors to help with the increased gun enforcement through a variety of programs.
The NRA is lobbying Congress for 50 million to implement Project Exile or something like it in every major city.
In Fort Worth the public relations campaign designed to make criminals leave their guns at home is being financed by local businessmen Perry and Lee Bass.
In 1991 considered the city s worst year for violent crime there were 195 homicides.
But by 1998 there were only 64 and Fort Worth s violent crime rate dropped more in the past two years than Richmond s under Project Exile.
I m excited about bearing down on criminals with guns because I don t want to go back to those days Moore said.
If I can take a gun away from one criminal and one person doesn t get shot or killed man I feel great.
WASHINGTON October 17 (Xinhua) The crime rate in the United States declined in 1998 for the seventh straight year with the murder and robbery rates being the lowest in three decades the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported Sunday.
The overall violent crime rate 566 murders rapes robberies and assaults per 100 000 residents dropped to its lowest level since 1985 according to the report.
The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998 down 5.
4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989 the FBI said.
A total of 16 914 murders were reported last year one murder every 31 minutes but it still was the lowest murder rate six slayings for every 100 000 people since 1967.
Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime rate to President Bill Clinton said in a statement.
But he cautioned that The report also said firearms were used in 64.
Handguns were the type of firearms most often reported used in the killings.
ARRESTS BY NEW JERSEY TROOPERS SHOW ANOTHER DROP IN SEPTEMBER (DW).
Arrests by the New Jersey State Police were down 42 percent in September from the same period last year and the head of the state troopers union said Wednesday that he attributed the decline to low morale and troopers fear of being accused of racial profiling.
The statistics which are published monthly show a continuing trend of fewer arrests since February when Col.
Williams superintendent of the State Police was forced to resign by Gov.
Williams had said in a newspaper interview at the time that certain racial and ethnic groups dominate segments of the illegal drug trade.
In the month after the resignation the number of arrests also fell 42 percent.
Troopers made 1 042 arrests last month 754 fewer than the 1 796 made in September 1998 according to figures released Tuesday.
The number of traffic summonses issued was also down by about 10 percent to 32 567 last month from 36 074 a year ago.
Trooper Edward Lennon president of the State Troopers Fraternal Organization said the decline the largest since March reflected troopers poor morale and fears of being accused of singling out minority drivers.
7 Lennon said that Troopers John Hogan 29 and James Kenna 28 were indicted on charges of attempted murder and assault in the April 1998 shooting of three unarmed men two of them black and one Hispanic on the New Jersey Turnpike.
The incident led to widespread public criticism as well as state and federal investigations of the force.
I think troopers are less likely to take the step further that is required to initiate a patrol related arrest Lennon said.
When they stop a car for speeding they re issued a summons for speeding and the driver s on his way.
There are indicators like a driver s nervousness that might ordinarily prompt troopers to search a car he said but it could be that they are ignoring those indicators.
John Hagerty a spokesman for the State Police would not comment on Lennon s assertions.
Hagerty said the decline could be linked to the reassignment of 40 troopers to flood relief duty last month or to a continuing decline in the overall crime rate.
Let s not forget that in 1998 we recorded a 9 percent drop in crime and the FBI is telling us we re looking at a similar decline in 1999 he said.
With declining crime rates you re going to have fewer arrests.
Hagerty said troopers were also busier aiding drivers last month with 15 127 reports of assistance compared with 14 277 in September 1998.
The State Police began publishing the monthly figures in April at the recommendation of Peter G.
Verniero then the state attorney general to increase accountability and public confidence in the force.
Hagerty said he could not say whether either goal had been achieved.
State Police get letters pro and con on a daily basis he said.
EX POLICE COMMISSIONER RELISHES BEING BACK IN HUNT FOR TERRORISTS.
WASHINGTON Six years after stepping down as New York City s police commissioner Raymond W.
Kelly finds himself playing cop again this time as commissioner of the U.
Customs Service with a mission that includes tracking down terrorists who might try to cross the borders in time for this week s millennium celebrations.
It feels like I never really left the beat said Kelly who ran the New York City Police Department when terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in 1993 the last deadly attack by foreign terrorists on American soil.
In the last few weeks the Customs Service seems to have proved that the potential millennium threat is real.
14 customs inspectors arrested an Algerian man Ahmed Ressam as he crossed from Canada into Washington state.
Prosecutors said his car was packed with a nitroglycerine like chemical and other bomb making components.
he had a reservation at a motel in Seattle near the Space Needle.
Seattle officials later canceled the public celebration there because of security concerns.
And five days after Ressam s arrest customs agents in Vermont detained two people who have since been tied by prosecutors to Algerian militant groups.
Kelly speaks somberly of what the arrests might suggest.
We ve got to be concerned he said his stocky compact frame and thick New York accent bringing Jimmy Cagney to mind.
He recalled rushing to the World Trade Center on Feb.
26 1993 when a bomb unleashed a fireball killing six people and leaving a seven story crater where a parking garage had been.
The thing I remember most vividly he said was looking down and seeing this hole this huge hole.
But every so often the solemnity in Kelly s voice gives way to his obvious excitement at how the Customs Service among the least glamorous of law enforcement agencies has found itself on the front lines of the war against terrorism.
Yes absolutely I feel energized invigorated he said.
He is convinced that the professionalism of his agents in Washington state prevented a terrorist attack.
The arrest prompted President Clinton to announce a heightened state of alert for federal law enforcement agencies.
In the last two weeks Kelly has added 500 inspectors to border stations.
This whirlwind of excitement is a reminder of why he told Clinton last year that he wanted to run the Customs Service.
It was technically a demotion from his last job as the Treasury Department s undersecretary for enforcement a post in which he supervised not only the Customs Service but also the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.
It was a step down but it was an inside the beltway step down he said.
Undersecretary was a policy job and that s fine and I enjoyed it.
There were worries earlier this year that Kelly might have to cut short his tenure.
This was a shock to me said Kelly a 58 year old Marine Corps veteran who always prided himself on staying in shape.
He was back at work within days of the surgery and has resumed his daily visits to the gym in his condominium complex spending 40 minutes on a treadmill before hitting the weights.
As New York s police commissioner Kelly had a resume drawn up by central casting.
The youngest of five children he was raised in a building at Columbus Avenue and 91st Street in Manhattan It s now a McDonald s he says with a sigh before moving to Queens as a teen ager.
His father a milkman later worked for the Internal Revenue Service.
His one sister worked in the fashion industry before retiring.
Like his three brothers Kelly joined the Marines.
While working in the stockroom in the baby clothes department at Macy s Kelly saw a recruiting ad for the police.
He registered at the Police Academy graduating first in a class of 1 800.
His tenure as police commissioner was brief only 18 months but Kelly was praised for his performance both for the overall decline in the crime rate and for his sensitivity to racial concerns.
Jimmy Breslin the newspaper columnist described him as a city treasure.
Kelly said he had long wondered what else he might have accomplished had Mayor Rudolph Giuliani not decided shortly after his election in November 1993 to find a new commissioner.
Giuliani had the absolute right to pick his own police commissioner he said.
He still sees plenty of New York where his wife who sells medical equipment lives in their apartment in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan.
We have a commuting deal and she ll come down to Washington virtually every weekend if I don t go up he said.
NEW ORLEANS (AP) A week after Mayor Marc Morial received a national award for overhauling the city police department and a coinciding drop in crime two teen agers were murdered after leaving a weekend party in an upscale neighborhood.
Four more people have been killed since then the latest victims in a disturbing trend.
There have been 110 murders in New Orleans this year compared with 80 by the same time a year ago.
Selected checks of major cities including Baltimore Boston Dallas Los Angeles New York and Philadelphia found that murders are up over last year.
The increases follow a substantial drop in murder rates across the country during most of the last decade.
In May the FBI said murder and other serious crimes reported to the police dropped for an eighth consecutive year in 1999 by far the longest running crime decline on record.
Murder was down 2 percent in cities over 500 000 and 8 percent overall.
Several leading criminal justice experts agreed that the public should no longer expect to see the same significant drops in the rate of violent crimes that occurred in the 1990s.
But they were unsure whether this year s murder upswing is temporary or whether America s violent crime rate has reached its low point and will now increase.
at some point you can t go any lower said James Alan Fox a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
but the issue of thrill and revenge motivation is still here and remains as American as apple pie and we have not seen an abatement of this type of violence.
Steve Levitt a University of Chicago economics professor who specializes in criminal justice issues actually expects a long term drop in violent crime.
He said unabated prison growth has removed violent offenders from society and is serving as a deterrent.
The murder rate for the first half of the year has dropped in some large cities Denver and Phoenix among them by as much as 28 percent.
Demography is working against us said Fox noting the number of people between 14 and 20 considered crime prone ages is growing.
If we don t pay attention we could see youth violence so bad we ll look back on the 1990s and say Those were the good old days.
When Morial took office in 1994 New Orleans had the nation s worst murder rate.
That has fallen more than 50 percent since then with 162 murders last year.
Conference of Mayors in Seattle on June 10 Morial received the City Livability Award for turning things around.
But now New Orleans is on pace for 230 murders this year the total in 1998.
Police Superintendent Richard Pennington has blamed most of the killing on drug gangs.
The real question may be why the city s 1999 rate was so low according to Al Blumstein a criminal justice professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
He said last year s tally was an anomaly.
Unlike Fox Blumstein sees less of a threat posed by the growing population of young people.
The crime rate for that age group has been falling at about 5 percent he said and he expects violent crime rates to level off.
We ve solved the easy stuff now it s going to be a lot harder to go beyond that he said.
None of the experts found evidence that the increase in some city murder rates is due to an economic slowdown.
M economics professor and director of criminal justice at the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas instead suggested that recent public embarrassments for police in Los Angeles and New York has left officers more gun shy about the way they treat suspects.
We may be seeing something here in terms of temporary drop in police efficiency because of either morale corruption or scandal he said.
CALIFORNIA PRISON POPULATION DECLINES FOR FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 20 YEARS.
LOS ANGELES The California state prison system which led the huge national prison building boom for years has recorded the first decline in its inmate population in more than two decades according to state officials.
The drop although tiny has already caused some officials to say that it is time for California to temporarily halt a prison buildup that inspired spending in other states across the country and had a big effect on the state budget.
At one point in the mid 1990s California began spending more on prisons than for its giant university system.
6 billion on prison construction and with increasingly tough laws for repeat offenders has had little trouble filling the new cells.
Frankly it s a lot of money that the governor and the Legislature can use for other social problems.
We re still going to need prisons but at a much lower rate.
The state s prison population of 161 401 in late June was 360 fewer inmates than in June 1999.
In one sense 360 is a drop in the bucket said Franklin Zimring an expert on prisons and a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley.
The big news is that the bucket didn t get any bigger this year.
This is very good news which we haven t seen nationally Zimring added.
Among the largest states at least California seems to be the only one actually experiencing a decline in the prison population according to officials around the country.
Nationally the prison population continues to grow although the rate has slowed over the last five years.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In Texas which has the nation s second largest prison population the number of inmates increased by 2.
9 percent to 150 359 from June 1999 to last month officials there said.
This rate of increase was greater than it was the year before but significantly less than the 5 percent increase in the state s prison population from June 1996 to June 1997.
Florida which has the third largest prison population had a 3.
8 percent increase from June 1999 to last month state officials there said.
Between June 1999 and last month New York state experienced a 0.
5 percent increase in its inmate population bringing its total to 71 021.
3 percent decrease in the state s prison population then it rose the next year with a 2 percent increase.
Flateau spokesman for the New York State Department of Correctional Services said The violent population is still increasing but the nonviolent population is not.
And any growth is attributable to violent offenders.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Terhune said the growth of the prison population in California has been steadily slowing over the last three years.
Terhune said it was still unclear whether the decline represents a long term trend or simply a short term dip.
Considering what growth was this is significant.
He speculated that several factors played a role in the decline including a decrease in new inmates sentenced by courts fewer parole violators returned with new terms and a slowdown in the rate of parole violators returned to custody.
Officials in California also said they were increasingly turning to alternatives to prison such as drug rehabilitation programs and additional parole.
Zimring said the declines should have occurred years ago to match the decline in the crime rate which has been falling in California since the early 1990s.
The prison admission numbers have finally caught up with the trends in crime he said.
This is a state that has become almost addicted to massive increases in punishment and now it appears it has taken a vacation from that attitude.
Several large cities in other states have also reported decreases in crime in recent years.
California is still going ahead with plans to build a 335 million 5 000 bed high security prison in the town of Delano.
But it will be the last for several years Terhune said adding We can go five years without having to go to the Legislature for additional construction.
Rose Braz a defense lawyer in Oakland and the program director for Critical Resistance a group that monitors prisons and criminal justice issues said the state s new numbers were evidence that the Delano prison was not necessary.
Maybe people are really starting to question the reliance on incarceration as the answer to everything.
But other states such as Virginia have experienced declines one year only to see increases the next.
California as in so many things is the leader in the nation both in things good and bad said Alfred Blumstein a professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
The drop in California is so small that it might just be noise but it could also be an indication that finally we re seeing the first dove after the flood.
NUMBER OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS ON DEATH ROW HITS 24 YEAR HIGH.
If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on Thursday as planned five men who committed murder when they were 17 will have been put to death this year in the United States.
That is more than in any year since 1954 when six teen agers were executed in Florida and Georgia.
Williams now 32 is one of 80 condemned youthful offenders those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes and while they make up only a small percentage of the overall death row population more are awaiting execution than at any time since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
The practice of condemning teen agers reflects the complexity of attitudes about capital punishment in the United States.
While 23 of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution of youthful offenders only a handful have actually carried out such executions since the death penalty was reinstated.
Half of all condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
In South Carolina where four juvenile offenders are on death row Wayne Bailey a district attorney expressed a view popular among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
If you do an adult crime Bailey said the jury ought to have the option to come back with the death penalty.
But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty as well as national organizations that are neutral on the issue are expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were according to most laws still children when they committed their crimes.
The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that permit such executions according to the State Department.
Language prohibiting the practice is included in several international human rights treaties including the U.
Convention on the Rights of the Child which only the United States and Somalia have not yet ratified.
It offends my conscience to execute someone who was under 18 at the time of the crime said District Attorney Joshua Marquis of Astoria Ore.
a member of the board of the National Association of District Attorneys who otherwise supports the death penalty.
Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for 16 and 17 year olds by one vote in 1989.
The previous year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and unusual punishment but legal experts are split on whether that constitutes a ban on such executions.
No one younger than 16 at the time of the crime has been executed and only one person who was 16 at the time of the crime has been executed.
Of the 23 states that permit the execution of juvenile offenders only seven have carried out such executions since 1976.
Texas Virginia South Carolina Louisiana Missouri Georgia and Oklahoma.
Experts say that it is little surprise that most are Southern states since the South has the highest incarceration rate and the highest execution rate in general.
This year Virginia and Texas each executed two men who committed their crimes when they were under 18.
Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders charged with federal crimes and when New York reinstated the death penalty in 1995 it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders last year.
Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in the late 1980s and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
The American Bar Association and the Children s Defense Fund oppose death sentences for juvenile offenders.
In South Carolina several former prosecutors formed a group to protect juvenile offenders last year when they learned their state has four on death row.
Considering all the ways the government failed our children from crack babies to horrible public schools to miserable health care we can at least ask the government not to willfully kill them said Zoe Sanders Nettles a former prosecutor who helped found the group South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Execution of Children.
In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned youthful offender.
Southern black poor male and his victim was white and female.
The six teen agers who were executed in 1954 were all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men or the rape of white girls.
Williams lawyers have asked the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute Williams sentence to life imprisonment and are planning a last minute appeal to the U.
nn (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The American Bar Association and the Children s Defense Fund have condemned the sentencing to death of juvenile offenders and have written letters to the pardons board on Williams s behalf.
Rosalynn Carter the former first lady has also written asking that Williams sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.
As a society we traditionally have given special consideration to children who commit crimes because we recognize that they lack the maturity or the mental capacity to function as adults.
Williams cause has also been taken up by the European Union a measure of the repugnance other Western countries have for the execution of juvenile offenders.
A representative of the union met with the Georgia pardons board Monday to present an urgent humanitarian appeal for the sentence to be commuted to life imprisonment a European Union official said.
While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally the U.
High Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International a human rights advocacy group report that the only countries other than the United States to have carried out such executions in the last 10 years are Iran Nigeria Pakistan Saudi Arabia Yemen and Congo.
The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that time more than the other countries combined according to Amnesty International.
China which executes more people than any other country in the world formally banned the execution of juvenile offenders in 1997.
Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for juvenile offenders include Japan South Korea Singapore and Libya.
treaty the execution of juvenile offenders is also banned under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
Senate voted to ratify that in 1992 but specifically reserved the right to execute juvenile offenders.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647 when 16 year old Thomas Graunger was reportedly hanged in Plymouth Colony for bestiality involving a cow and a horse said Victor Streib a leading expert on juveniles and the death penalty and the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern University.
Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme expression of Americans fears of violence and the attitudes among politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as tough on crime.
The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as adults with their crimes judged as more significant than their youth as a mitigating factor.
Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of juvenile violent crime in the mid 1990s and has continued even as that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that the brain is still developing through adolescence and that with proper intervention violent juvenile offenders can be rehabilitated.
said Laurence Steinberg a psychology professor at Temple University and the director of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice.
I don t think that 16 or 17 seems like a very reasonable answer to that.
Law enforcement officials and politicians who favor the treatment of teen age offenders as adults say the traditional juvenile justice system was not set up to handle the numbers of teen agers who now have access to guns and who commit the types of crimes that are punished with the death penalty.
Alexander Williams was 17 in 1986 when he abducted 16 year old Aleta Bunch from a shopping mall in Augusta Ga.
Aleta s mother Carolyn Bunch said of her daughter s killer in a recent interview I don t care how old he was.
I could pull the switch on him and never have any remorse.
Daniel Craig the district attorney in Augusta said in an interview that he opposes clemency for Williams because the jury had determined that the appropriate response of a civilized society is the death penalty.
Under Georgia law at 17 Williams was automatically charged as an adult but it was the prosecutor s decision to seek the death penalty.
Williams is described in prison records as mentally ill.
records indicate he is bipolar and has schizoaffective disorder which reportedly leads him to worship the actress Sigourney Weaver as god and to dress as the Lone Ranger.
As a juvenile he was charged with several offenses including reckless conduct for holding a knife to a 13 year old classmate s throat.
Williams sister Alexsandriya Clemons and half brother Rodney Blair have both sworn affidavits describing the abuse their mother meted out to all of them as children.
last month where they were visiting their brother on death row they said their mother had beaten them frequently with electrical cords frying pans belts barbells and a vacuum cleaner.
Their brother Alexander they said bore the brunt of the worst abuse.
One time she was hitting his toes with a screwdriver and a hammer Clemons said.
They said their mother Pat Blair held down three jobs while supporting five children.
Collins who has since died did not present any of the details of his client s childhood.
Last week four jurors and a fifth this week swore affidavits stating that had they known about Williams childhood abuse and his mental illness they would not have voted to sentence him to death.
It is for that reason they too are asking Georgia s pardons board to grant Williams clemency.
nn Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families marked by drugs alcohol violence and mental illness.
As children the offenders had to figure out how not to get beaten to a pulp or sexually abused by one of the so called adults who d been placed in charge of them said Craig Haney a professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz who has compiled the social histories of many juvenile offenders on death row for defense lawyers.
That kind of early abuse can lead to aggression and violence Haney and other experts contend.
Haney and other experts also say that the stereotypical image of teen age killers as superpredators who cannot be redeemed is not borne out by scientific evidence.
Even people who are cynical about the rehabilitation of adults recognize that juveniles are different Haney said.
It s not until later in someone s life that you re willing to throw up your hands and say there is nothing more we can do now.
But many law enforcement officials view these offenders differently.
Gary Hart is not a kid the prosecutor said during the trial of Gary Davis Hart II who was 16 when he fatally shot a restaurant manager in Mobile Ala.
Gary Hart who is on Alabama s death row testified at trial that an older man had given him and a friend instructions on how to rob the restaurant.
Once he had cocked the gun he did not know how to uncock it he said.
He said he had taken the gun from the trunk of his mother s car.
Christopher Simmons who is on death row in Missouri was 4 when his stepfather began taking him to bars and pouring him drinks defense psychologists say.
His stepfather would tie young Christopher to a tree when he went fishing.
At 17 in the course of a burglary in 1983 Christopher and a 15 year old friend bound and gagged a 46 year old woman and pushed her into a river and she drowned.
The 15 year old was given life without parole.
Seventeen years old the prosecutor said of Christopher at his trial.
The prosecutor suggested that Christopher s family would be better off if he were executed.
Kevin Hughes had a mother who was a schizophrenic and an alcoholic according to court records.

The mother had a series of violent boyfriends who beat and raped Kevin while his mother laughed according to the affidavits.
Kevin got really bad beatings and whippings because he could not understand things and was mentally slow his oldest brother said in his affidavit.
Kevin Hughes now 38 was 16 when he raped and strangled a 9 year old girl Rochelle Graham.
NUMBER OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS ON DEATH ROW HITS 24 YEAR HIGH.
If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on Thursday as planned five men who committed murder when they were 17 will have been put to death this year in the United States.
That is more than in any year since 1954 when six teen agers were executed in Florida and Georgia.
Williams now 32 is one of 80 condemned juvenile offenders those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes and while they make up only a small percentage of the overall death row population more are awaiting execution than at any time since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
The practice of condemning teen agers reflects the complexity of attitudes about capital punishment in the United States.
While 23 of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution of youthful offenders only a handful have actually carried out such executions since the death penalty was reinstated.
Half of all condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
In South Carolina where four juvenile offenders are on death row Wayne Bailey a district attorney expressed a view popular among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
If you do an adult crime Bailey said the jury ought to have the option to come back with the death penalty.
But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty as well as national organizations that are neutral on the issue are expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were according to most laws still children when they committed their crimes.
The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that permit such executions according to the State Department.
Language prohibiting the practice is included in several international human rights treaties including the U.
Convention on the Rights of the Child which only the United States and Somalia have not yet ratified.
Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for 16 and 17 year olds by one vote in a 1989 ruling.
The previous year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and unusual punishment but legal experts are split on whether that constitutes a ban on such executions.
No one younger than 16 at the time of the crime has been executed and only one person who was 16 at the time of the crime has been executed.
Of the 23 states that permit the execution of juvenile offenders only seven have carried out such executions since 1976.
Texas Virginia South Carolina Louisiana Missouri Georgia and Oklahoma.
Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders charged with federal crimes and when New York reinstated the death penalty in 1995 it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders last year.
Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in the late 1980s and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned juvenile offender.
Southern black poor male and his victim was white and female.
The six teen agers who were executed in 1954 were all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men or the rape of white girls.
While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally the U.
High Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International a human rights advocacy group report that the only countries other than the United States to have carried out such executions in the last 10 years are Iran Nigeria Pakistan Saudi Arabia Yemen and Congo.
The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that time more than the other countries combined according to Amnesty International.
Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for juvenile offenders include Japan South Korea Singapore and Libya.
convention the execution of juvenile offenders is also banned under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
Senate voted to ratify that in 1992 but specifically reserved the right to execute juvenile offenders.
The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647 said Victor Streib a leading expert on juveniles and the death penalty and the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern University.
Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme expression of Americans fears of violence and the attitudes among politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as tough on crime.
The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as adults with their crimes judged as more significant than their youth as a mitigating factor.
Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of juvenile violent crime in the mid 1990s and has continued even as that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that the brain is still developing through adolescence and that with proper intervention violent juvenile offenders can be rehabilitated.
Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families marked by drugs alcohol violence and mental illness.
But many law enforcement officials view these offenders differently.

RATE OF VIOLENT CRIME DROPS 10 PERCENT IN 1999 CONTINUING DOWNWARD TREND.
WASHINGTON The rate of violent crime in the United States continued a downward trend in 1999 with the 10 percent drop last year representing one of the largest decreases in decades the Justice Department said Sunday.
The latest figures released by the department s Bureau of Justice Statistics show a continuation of declines in every major type of personal and property crime between 1993 and 1999.
During this period the rate of violent crimes in general declined 32.
Results of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey begun in 1972 show that property crime rates continue a 25 year downward trend.
Crime rates involving property including burglary and motor vehicle theft dropped 9 percent from 1998 to 1999 decreasing from 217 per 1 000 U.
Americans were more secure in their homes from 1998 to 1999 with the number of completed burglaries dropping from 38.
After a period of slow decline that was interrupted by an increase from 1980 to 1981 the burglary rate fell each year through the rest of the period the Justice Department report said.
The 1999 household burglary rate was about a third that of the adjusted rate of 1973.
Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime rates to a healthy economy crime prevention programs tougher sentences and more police officers on the street.
As with earlier reports of similar declines President Clinton called the figures further proof that the Clinton Gore administration s anticrime strategy of more police on our streets and fewer guns in the wrong hands has helped to create the safest America in a generation.
Ray Sullivan a spokesman for the Republican presidential candidate George W.
It s typical for the Clinton Gore administration to take credit for good things in America.
But much of the credit for the decline in crime has to go to governors and local officials who have passed tougher laws longer prison sentences and lowered parole rates.
The crime rate report is based upon information on nonlethal violent and property crimes gathered during the annual National Crime Victimization Survey.
In 1999 42 895 households and 77 750 people age 12 or older were interviewed for the survey.
Although homicides were not included in the survey the report said preliminary data gathered separately by the FBI indicated that the murder rate declined about 8 percent last year.
Males account for about three quarters of murder victims.
About one in eight of these victims is under 18 years of age and firearms are used in seven of 10 homicides it said.
The report said 44 percent of last year s violent crimes against people were reported to police compared with 34 percent of property crimes.
Robbery was the violent crime most often reported with 61 percent of incidents disclosed while rape and other sexual assaults were the least often brought to the attention of law enforcement.
Males were more likely to be victims of violent crime including robbery and assault than females in 1999.
Males experienced violent crime at rates 28 percent greater and were robbed at rates more than two times that of females said the report.
During 1999 it said three females per 1 000 were raped or sexually assaulted compared with 0.
AUSTIN Texas The Texas prison system grew faster than any other in the country over the past decade and one out of every 20 adults in the state is under the watch of the criminal justice system according to national study released Monday.
The sheer numbers of people in prison and jail in Texas are signs of system fixated on punishment and devoid of compassion said Vincent Schiraldi the director of the Justice Policy Institute of Washington D.
An Analysis of Incarceration and Crime Trends in the Lone Star State.
According to the institute s study Texas also has the nation s largest populations of probationers and parolees.
The report confirms statistics that have long been known to state criminal justice policy analysts and several proponents of tough sanctions for lawbreakers said the numbers represent the sentiments of most Texans.
We didn t have this prison building boom by happenstance said Dianne Clements president of the crime victims advocacy group Justice for All.
It happened because the citizens and taxpayers who live here every day determined that they would no longer abide a revolving door prison system.
That cost was high and will probably get higher.
7 billion in bonds to triple the size of the state s prison system which now exceeds 150 000 beds.
When lawmakers return to Austin in January they will be asked to send a 500 million bond package to the voters for the construction of three maximum security units.
In all 163 190 state inmates are in custody in Texas compared with 163 107 in California according to the institute which supports alternatives to prison.
Tony Fabelo who heads the Texas Criminal Justice Policy Council which assesses prison needs for state lawmakers said the institute s figures include inmates housed in low risk substance abuse treatment facilities and those in county jails awaiting transfer to state facilities.
The Texas prison population s average annual increase of 11.
8 percent during the 1990s was not only the highest growth in the nation but was almost twice the average annual growth of the other states.
If Texas were a country it would have the highest incarceration rate in the world easily surpassing that of the United States and Russia the next two finishers and would be seven times that of the next biggest prison system in China.
Blacks in Texas are incarcerated at seven times the rate of whites and nearly one in three young African American men in Texas is under some form of criminal justice control.
The institute is a think tank of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice and the study was paid for with a grant from the Center on Crime Communities and Culture.
The groups provide programs for families of inmates and look for other solutions to criminal behavior beyond prisons such as substance abuse treatment.
The institute determined that Texas added 98 000 inmates to its prison system in the 90s which is almost 25 000 more inmates than the population of New York s entire system.
Yet since 1995 New York s decline in crime was four times greater than that of Texas the study found.
According to the study the crime rate declined much more slowly in Texas than it did in other large states.
1 percent half the national average and the least of any of the nation s five largest states.
If locking more people up really reduced crime Texas should have the lowest crime rate in the country said Jason Ziedenberg another co author of the study.
The cost of having one in three young black men under criminal justice control is a steep price to pay for the states lackluster crime declines.
Bush the Republican presidential nominee defended the state s criminal justice policies as tough but fair.
Clearly Texas was right to develop strong laws for dealing with criminal activities and strong laws covering juvenile crime to let them know that there are consequences for their behavior said Bush press aide Mike Jones.
What the authors of that study might not understand is that Texas also has been very aggressive in using rehabilitation efforts and faith based organizations to change people s hearts.
Bush Texas has the lowest violent crime rate in 26 years and the lowest murder rate since the 1950s.
Rodney Ellis D Houston said Texas should be receptive to critical assessments of its institutions and open to suggestions of policy changes.
I think it is helpful that groups such as this force us to take a look at impact of our policies Ellis said.
I firmly believe in punishing those who break the law but these are some pretty graphic statistics.
We have to realize that our lock them up and throw away the key mentality is costing us a lot of money.
Maybe there is too much emphasis on dealing with criminal justice issues on the back end of life rather than on the front end.
