AUSTIN Abe Zimmerman had not been to a trade show in years and never to one for booksellers.
But as the new president of Book People he flew to Chicago for a quick total immersion at Book Expo.
the Austin store s buying director Tracey Tarlton and marketing manager David Hutts a veteran of the Book Expos that serve as the American Bookseller Association s annual conventions.
By Saturday night Zimmerman was eating dinner with author Tim O Brien swapping golf stories and talking about store events.
This is an industry that s changing dramatically right now Zimmerman said and I m not so sure how many people know what s going on and how to react.
A businessman who helped start Katz s Delicatessen and was part of a hi tech start up company called Technology Works he said he found the energy at Book Expo less than dynamic.
I felt like these were people who weren t in control of their fate any more.
Those who have lasted through changes in the business continue to quietly look for ways to do better and more efficiently what they have a reputation for doing.
I did feel everyone understands the importance of independent stores Zimmerman said.
Last year several top publishing houses including Random House skipped the convention because of tensions with the ABA which had sued them for making discount deals with chains.
This year most large publishers came back though in reduced numbers and used less exhibit space.
The convention attracted 1 500 exhibitors with 400 authors promoting their books.
In this era when a recent newsletter from the famed Tattered Cover bookstore in Denver warned that the big chains are ringing the independents with stores attempting to squeeze them out and when books are sold at Randalls and Sam s not to mention on the Internet Austin independents face a clear challenge.
A consumer purchasing report released by the Book Industry Study Group shows that independent booksellers experienced a 1.
4 percent market share decline last year down to 17 percent of the books purchased.
Most books are now sold in nontraditional outlets everywhere from car washes to discount stores or through book clubs and electronic bookstores.
It s important for independent bookstores to have a distinctive flavor and still cover the bases said Tarlton to also carry the bestsellers people expect to see.
She spent much of her time gathering galleys from better smaller presses.
At Toad Hall children s events including author readings and special lunches have been a priority to bring customers to the Austin store which is owned by Barbara Bonds Thomas outgoing president of the ABA.
This year the store was singled out at Book Expo and awarded the Pannell Award for innovative children s events.
More and more independent booksellers appear to be facing the reality that increased service the more specific the better is their best chance of keeping customers at a time when sales have been disheartening.
In the last seven years membership in the ABA dropped by almost half to 3 500 this year as independent bookstores closed.
Sales were flat last year and consumer spending on adult fiction and non fiction increased by less than 1 percent.
An independent bookseller manager in Missouri said that she realized that with 55 churches in her area the residents had a deep interest in religion.
Our customers still don t trust the Internet to send them books the bookseller said.
Now she is looking at a process introduced at the convention by Ingram Distributors called Lightning Print.
It allows books to be stored digitally and printed one at a time on demand.
Although conglomerates increasingly control publishing there is still room for specialized service and individual stores.
One bookstore that s enthusiastic can make a book of poetry said Michael Wiegers managing editor of the award winning Copper Canyon Press in Port Townsend Wash.
though he says such a store might be part of a chain or an independent.
The bookseller of the year for the African American booksellers group Blackboard Michele Lewis of New Orleans started a store in her mid 20s.
She has seen her business grow in a few years to a second store and stresses personal service to a niche market.
Accepting the award she thanked God her mother and her family and friends for allowing the business to grow.
Emma Rodgers owner of Black Images in Dallas and a director of the ABA said an African American Booksellers school held in Chicago before Book Expo was well attended.
During the convention the sale of Random House to the Bertelsmann German conglomerate was confirmed and many sellers saw that as bad news.
Avin Domnitz executor director of the ABA said.
Consolidation of books and publishers has never worked to the advantage of the independent.
Increasingly the booksellers association is involved in litigation as independents fight back any way they can against changes they see as threatening their survival in the industry.
A suit by the ABA accusing Borders and Barnes AMP.
Noble of antitrust violations is still awaiting a formal response.
Though they may be tired from fighting for economic survival the booksellers showed their trademark idealism.
They rallied around Bill Kramer whose Washington D.
bookstore refused to hand over the bookbuying records of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky to independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Said ABA board member Oren Teicher.
There s no more important issue than that information about books they have purchased is personal and confidential.
Booksellers have long seen themselves as involved in a marketplace of ideas and as such different from the owners of hardware and drugstores.
The Kramer case gives them an opportunity to cling to that while all around them appears to be changing.

NEW YORK With competition intensifying among electronic booksellers Barnes AMP.
announced Thursday that it would sell shares to the public of its money losing online venture which trails in sales behind the pioneering leader Amazon.
Noble the nation s largest bookstore chain intends to sell 20 percent of the online venture Barnesandnoble.
com which generated 14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon s 147.
The initial public offering could take place in the next 30 days the company said.
They re using the IPO to televise that they have online capability and secondly to enrich the value of Barnes AMP.
Noble stock which is going to retain 80 percent of the online venture said Linda Killian portfolio manager for Renaissance Capital Corp.
While the overall stock market has recently slumped some new issues of Web based businesses like Geocities have risen sharply.
Noble announced its plans for a public offering the company said that its loss for the second quarter tripled primarily because of a 23 million loss from the online venture.
7 million or 8 cents a share fully diluted compared with a loss of 1.
37 million or 2 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier.
The results were in line with Wall Street analysts forecasts.
Citing Security and Exchange Commission restrictions Mary Ellen Keating a spokeswoman for Barnes AMP.
Noble in New York declined to answer questions about why the company intends to make the offering or how the proceeds would be used.
Typically when a company spins off a division it could mean that the unit s executives will get more independence and stock option incentives that give them more of a stake in the company Ms.
Noble hired several top executives for the online venture including a new chief financial officer and two vice presidents in marketing and international strategies.
One of the new executives John Rindlaub Jr.
a PC based grocery shopping and home delivery company.
The chief executive of the online venture will remain Stephen Riggio the vice chairman of Barnes AMP.
The number of users of the company s Web site (www.
com) has continued to grow with 720 000 customers by early August compared with 500 000 last May.
These gains come as the company redesigned its Web site to offer one click ordering.
The online division is also preparing to introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected 1998 advertising budget of 35 million to 40 million.
The New York office of TBWA Chiat Day was named last month to handle the account.
But the competition among online bookstores could intensify with the entry of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG which is expected to open its online store Booksonline in Europe and the United States in the fall.
started its online bookstore earlier this year although the company the second largest bookstore retailer has been concentrating more on overseas expansion with the opening of conventional bookstores in London and Singapore.
BOOK INDUSTRY IN BIG SHIFT FOCUSED ON PRODUCT DELIVERY.
The flat sprawling warehouses of Nashville are leagues away from a New York literary lunch and repartee with a prominent author but this prosaic side of the nation s 8 billion consumer book market packing shipping and delivery has become a key to its future.
With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of Internet bookstores gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big Macs.
The announcement this month that the nation s leading bookseller Barnes AMP.
Noble will buy the leading wholesaler the Ingram Book Group for 600 million is just the latest move in a shifting field of distribution networks.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year the conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to squeeze as much savings as possible from back office functions.
com are looking for ways to make electronic commerce profitable and competitive by sending more of their orders through their own distribution centers.
For consumers this means that delivery will become swifter setting a standard of 24 hour service for online bookstores but also increasing the speed at which special orders are filled by stores on terra firma.
While top publishers troll for new alliances to share distribution regional distributors are on a spree of buying smaller independent publishers to spread their costs and to secure a customer base.
com the e commerce pioneer is preparing to buy a wholesaler of its own.
Meanwhile the Yankee Group a technology research organization forecasts that online sales of books will climb to 700 million by the end of this year.
Worried that they will be left by the wayside restive independent booksellers fret that a wholesaler owned by Barnes AMP.
Noble could be manipulated to reduce service to them or to tap into their records.
They ll be able to find out what our sales are what the profit margin is and then find out just how vulnerable these stores are and then move in said William Petrocelli the co owner of Book Passage an independent store in Corte Madera Calif.
He is circulating a letter among booksellers to challenge the sale with regulators.
The Borders Group bookstore chain started building up its distribution network long ago and now owns nine centers including four new ones in Nashville.
Last week it also announced the hiring of a new chief executive Philip Pfeffer who when he was chief executive of Ingram Distribution Group presided over the expansion of the company into the largest wholesale distributor of trade books in the world.
We have always viewed distribution as a strategic asset but frankly we used to get hammered for it because our competition didn t pay much attention to it said Robert F.
We ve got to become more efficient as an industry so I m not surprised that everyone is moving in that direction.
Noble s purchase of Ingram is just the most visible example of the industry shift.
According to several top publishing executives Amazon.
com had also been talking with Nashville based Ingram about a sale and remains interested in a purchase of Baker AMP.
Taylor president James Ulsamer said Anyone at the right time at the right price is for sale.
We neither confirm nor deny rumors speculation or chitchat about what we may be or may not be doing said Bill Curry a spokesman.
One top publishing executive said Amazon had moved to cut its ties with Ingram but John Ingram chairman of Ingram Book Group said that to his knowledge no such break had occurred.
Last week he sent out more than 5 000 letters to independent booksellers urging them to trust in the company s history of integrity and commitment to treat all customers equally.
Ingram people will continue to run our business with the same high degree of integrity as we ve always done.
Noble chairman and chief executive Leonard Riggio said his company would never ever ask for information from Ingram about a competitor.
From my point of view we re actually rooting for them and every other good bookstore in America he said noting that his company needed the support of other booksellers for Ingram to grow.
It is unlikely that many booksellers will break with the company as they approach Christmas their busiest and most profitable season.
But Ingram s pledge gives little comfort to the American Booksellers Association which is deeply distrustful of Barnes AMP.
Noble and has sued the company in San Francisco accusing it of unfair trade practices.
I m having a difficult time finding solace said Avin Mark Domnitz the chief executive of the trade group.
It s like putting the fox in the henhouse and taking his word that he s not going to eat the chickens.
Despite the almost visceral hostility from independent booksellers said Albert Greco an associate business professor at Fordham University who follows publishing Barnes AMP.
Noble s move was born out of its need to remain competitive in the face of potentially damaging market inroads made by online book operators which will transform the selling of books.
Most publishers and distributors are already proceeding as if the Barnes AMP.
Noble purchase is a fait accompli yet antitrust lawyers and even Wall Street analysts are more cautious about how federal regulators will regard the deal.
They predict that it will probably take much longer for the purchase to be approved than the 30 to 45 days foreseen by Barnes AMP.
Schuster s education division announced in May remains tied up in a second round of review by the Justice Department although the company keeps saying approval could come any day.
nn We think the deal was expensive and may be difficult to close because of regulatory concerns Danielle Turnoff Fox an analyst for J.
Noble set up some system of fire walls as the new owner of Ingram it would have access to extensive information about Amazon.
com s actual unit sales of books online.
There are competitive issues that are likely to come under intense scrutiny she added.
Michael Cooper a lawyer who specializes in antitrust cases at the Washington firm Bryan Cave said the Federal Trade Commission would be likely to review the deal because of its experience analyzing other mergers in the book industry.
If there are any real issues when they do their first look this could take some time he said adding that he expected the Ingram purchase to face a second round of intensive review that could take up to six months.
Meantime others in the industry are sizing up ways they can use distribution to overcome sluggish growth.
Last year sales of consumer or popular books grew only 1 percent from 1996 which means they did not even keep pace with population growth.
During the summer Time Warner s trade book division and HarperCollins which is owned by News Corp.
were in talks about forming a joint distribution network but they failed to come to an agreement said two top publishing executives who insisted on anonymity.
now owned by Bertelsmann AG announced a multimillion dollar investment to expand its book distribution center in Westminster Md.
while also setting a date to close its warehouse in Des Plaines Ill.
After opening a 30 million center near Charlottesville Va.
last year the German media conglomerate Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck is still in the process of adding its publishing houses to the network.
While publishers strive to streamline distribution networks regional distributors that serve independent publishers have in turn started buying up some of those publishing houses partly to secure their customer base and to spread the costs of back office functions.
Two leading distributors Publishers Group West in California and the National Book Network in Maryland are buying heavily these days.
We re looking at perhaps three or four different deals said Charles Winton chief executive of Publishers Group West which in the last three years has acquired four publishers through its parent company Publishers Group Inc.
Right now I have eight different prospectuses sitting on my desk.
He said he expected to double revenue from its publishing companies to nearly 20 million within 12 months.
The pace of change has been dizzying to publishers booksellers and distributors who talk about these recent shifts and the spate of mergers and consolidations as a sea change in the industry.
The whole process has sped up dramatically said National Book Network president Jed Lyons.
In the past it would take maybe two or three weeks and the book would arrive.
Today consumers aren t willing to wait two or three weeks.
In the 1960s when William Faulkner still walked the land while Eudora Welty produced some of her finest work and Willie Morris moved North Toward Home their native state was known as a place where more people wrote books than read them.
Books in Mississippi were sold in pharmacies equipped with rotating racks featuring Mickey Spillane thrillers or sometimes in department store nooks displaying Bibles and inspirational literature.
But in recent years a crop of small bookstores catering to serious readers grew up in the state and Mississippi s independent booksellers now find themselves in the middle of an escalating national feud with superstores such as Barnes AMP.
After nurturing their shops into a profitable existence local entrepreneurs in Mississippi and other points around the country are struggling against chain stores offering cheaper prices.
As Richard Howorth owner of Square Books in Oxford and president of the American Booksellers Association says In 1991 when Barnes AMP.
Noble and Borders began to expand there were 5 200 members of the ABA.
cut rate behemoths drive mom and pop stores out of existence.
But rather than return to the days before bookstores flourished the independent booksellers are fighting back.
The ABA which represents private bookstore owners filed an antitrust suit against Barnes AMP.
Noble and Borders last March charging the chains with undercutting the independent booksellers through secret and illegal deals with publishing houses.
By obtaining disproportionate discounting and additional credit unavailable to the independents Howorth said the chains are able to offer more attractive prices.
For example Tom Wolfe s new novel A Man in Full listed at 28.
The situation was exacerbated last month by revelations that Barnes AMP.
Noble the nation s biggest bookseller planned to purchase the country s leading wholesale distributor Ingram Book Group.
(Senator Ron Wyden an Oregon Democrat sympathetic to the independents last week called for the Justice Department to investigate the antitrust implications of the merger.
) In an interview at his store overlooking the historic courthouse square that Faulkner immortalized Howorth said that if the Barnes AMP.
Noble acquisition goes through small booksellers who buy from Ingram would be faced with the realistic threat of doing business with a company showing a desire to put everyone else out of business.
Since Square Books was established in 1979 the store has helped transform downtown Oxford from a rural outpost into a cosmopolitan center with a busy nightlife.
The store is on the major league circuit for authors promoting new books.
While reluctant to divulge his revenue Howorth estimates that he sells an average of six books per year for every man woman and child in the town of 12 000 residents.
Yet the University of Mississippi here awarded Barnes AMP.
Noble a franchise for a campus bookstore a couple of years ago.
As a result he withheld Square Book s support for an annual book conference that draws many writers to Oxford each spring.
After it became apparent that the campus store concentrated on textbooks and had a minimal operation for trade books a designation for quality fiction and non fiction Howorth renewed his support for the conference this year.
Nevertheless he said after years of growth our sales have been flat since Barnes AMP.
It s hard to say whether it s them or sales gravitating to Amazon.
com the Internet outlet involved in its own advertising war with Barnes AMP.
The independents may someday have the opportunity to develop sales over the Internet but not if we re obliterated from the retail face of the earth Howorth said.
All corporate bookstores are to one extent or another predators.
Lemuria a thriving independent book store in Jackson Miss.
has become a prime target for predatory activity says its proprietor John Evans who was frustrated by his inability to find good books in his hometown and started the store more than 20 years ago.
After outgrowing its original site Lemuria is now in a handsome building just off an interstate highway.
It is no coincidence Evans says that Books A Million a Southeastern chain selling at cut rate prices set up a store across the interstate from Lemuria a few years ago.
Noble recently opened its own store a couple of minutes away.
What they try to do is to go and find a store to prey on Evans said.
Lemuria is one of 26 plaintiffs in the action against Barnes AMP.
According to the independent booksellers lawsuit the rapid growth of national chains fueled by secret and illegal deals threatens the survival of independent bookstores and the diversity of American bookselling.
Small town enterprises such as Favorites Book Store which sponsors readings for children and book signing garden parties that have brought life to a neighborhood in Ocean Springs on the Mississippi Gulf Coast are in jeopardy.
Marilyn Lunceford the store s owner has told friends she fears her business will be ruined by a Barnes AMP.
Noble store projected for a new mall in nearby Gulfport.
Though the ABA suit was filed in California which has state laws regarding unfair trade practices and serves as the home for large number of independent booksellers it has strong support from members in Mississippi.
Noble and Borders formally responded to the suit in July by steadfastly denying allegations of deal making.
The litigation is still in preliminary stages but Howorth said he was encouraged by a 1994 consent agreement involving the ABA Penguin Books and other publishers.
After the ABA complained about unfair trade practices the publishers agreed to pay the booksellers 25 million.
BOOKSTORES SEE THEIR CAUSE IN YOU VE GOT MAIL.
You ve Got Mail is an enticing first kiss of a film with stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as irresistible as free puppies outside a store and New York City looking like a flower bedecked nirvana which is why audiences are falling hard for this season s most popular romantic comedy.
But there is one group of people who watch You ve Got Mail and see something other than Hollywood romance.
Never mind the Somewhere Over the Rainbow romantics of Nora Ephron s film.
Independent booksellers focus more on the movie s subplot and feel as though they are watching their own funeral.
Because You ve Got Mail is the first popular entertainment to focus on the plight of embattled independent booksellers as they try to survive the tidal wave of chain superstores (Barnes AMP.
Noble Borders) along with such online competitors as Seattle based Amazon.
It is a tense battle that has involved not only a war of words but also lawsuits as independent booksellers have taken their case to court alleging that chain superstores have engaged in unfair trade practices and extracted favoritism from publishers.
In six years independent booksellers have gone from selling one third of the books in this country to half that percentage and many beloved independents have closed including the recent demise of the Printers Inc.
So while other viewers feel a tug at their heartstrings as the Ryan and Hanks characters perform their wise cracking mating ritual booksellers brush away tears as the adorable little children s bookstore run by Ryan s character (Kathleen Kelly) is imperiled by a chain superstore run by Hanks character (Joe Fox).
Sons Books (carbon copy of a Barnes AMP.
Noble) muscles its way into the same Manhattan neighborhood offering it trademark mix of what Fox laughing describes as cheap books and legal addictive stimulants.
And in about six months a sign goes up on the front door of The Shop Around the Corner which was started by Kelly s mother and had been in the family ever since.
The movie made me feel very sad about what is happening in our business admits Carol Santaro co owner of the Fremont Place bookstore in Seattle.
We were both thankful the film brings out these issues especially for those who might not be aware.
You ve Got Mail does portray many of the problems for independent bookstores in this country says Paul Hanson manager of Eagle Harbor Book Co.
Meg Ryan s bookstore did close in the movie and that s the plight of a lot of bookstores these days.
The bookselling duel in the film which representatives at Barnes AMP.
Noble s headquarters in New York City declined to discuss is perhaps nowhere better mirrored in the Seattle area than in the bustling environs of University Village shopping center.
Noble superstore already having supplanted the long established Kay s Bookmark draws a steady crowd of customers who stroll through its wide aisles and sprawl in its overstuffed chairs as the upbeat elevator music of Guantanamera plays over loudspeakers.
Noble is a showcase of big bucks being spent to attract little customers (and their parents) with huge cardboard cutouts of favorite characters from children s books as well as tiny tables and stools and some kid Adirondack chairs.
From the picture windows in the department can be seen University Village shops and parking lots and not far beyond them a bright blue shape.
It turns out to be the awning on the front of a small bookstore for children All for Kids Books and Music.
Inside owner Chauni Haslet presides over a thriving independent of 4 000 square feet that sprawls through several rooms of varying shapes and sizes.
It is a homespun handwritten notes crazy quilt kind of place.
Haslet s attitude mirrors that of Ryan s character in the film.
While Kelly derides her chain store competition as a theme park multilevel mocha cino land Haslet simply refers to hers by its initials which she jokes stand for Big AMP.
You ve Got Mail is remarkably true although it is unfortunate that Tom Hanks makes the big guys look really lovable Haslet says.
She has already felt the muscle of the chains closing a second location in suburban Issaquah when a Barnes AMP.
Noble was opening there (one of several factors in the closing).
She decided to concentrate all her energies on the University District store moving aggressively to continue its success.
She expanded All for Kids into an adjoining storefront and hosted a series of daily events for four months prior to the opening at Barnes AMP.
These measures were intended to draw traffic convey properousness and foster customer loyalty.
All for Kids already chock full of products related to kid books (from plush characters to music to art) even added a section of adult books (all read and recommended by staffers) as a kind of living memorial to the defunct Kay s Bookmark.
All for Kids may indeed be the only children s bookstore in the country to stock a novel by Thomas Pynchon.
We knew that if we had stayed small not as visible with not as much window space we would not be in existence says Haslet who has 16 years experience in the book business.
Any time an independent sees a chain coming and does not make adjustments they re in trouble.
That is exactly what happened to The Shop Around the Corner in You ve Got Mail.
Kelly counts on her customers loyalty but sales continue to plummet each day that Fox Books is open.
Even a blitz of favorable media coverage about the little store s plight a battle depicted as Joan of Arc against Attila the Hun cannot stem the bleeding of red ink.
After the frantic going out of business sale Kelly returns to the shop one last time and surveys its empty shelves.
I feel the way I did when my mother died all over again and no one can make it right.
Independent booksellers hope that sympathy for The Shop Around the Corner will be transferred to their own stores.
distributed free movie tickets to booksellers in major cities and sent special You ve Got Mail posters to its members posters that included the additional lines.
Independent Bookstores for Independent Minds and Visit the shop around YOUR corner.
As Len Vlahos spokesman for the 3 300 member association stresses The movie has done what we anticipated it raises issues about independent bookstores that many people in the public may never have considered.
So this helps whether we happen to agree with how things are depicted in this Hollywood film.
It raises consciousness and gets people talking so we felt that our members needed to be connected to You ve Got Mail.
The connection is already paying some dividends at small independents in the Seattle area.
Booksellers may complain that The Shop Around the Corner is too cute to be real and that Kelly starts a new career much too easily after her store closes.
But those complaints have been muted by real customers who have come into their real stores bought books and expressed support because of having seen the film.
It is only a trickle of customers thus far but independent booksellers are grateful for any encouragement they can get these days.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Independent bookseller Patrice Wynne knew it was going to take a lot more than meditation to save her spiritually oriented bookstore when sales dipped for the first time in its 12 years.
Wynne is asking her customers to help save her Berkeley bookstore by making an investment that offers no material return.
We do not want the books sold in Berkeley to be mediated by corporate chains Barnes AMP.
We re saying You re a Main Street investor that has a social and cultural return on your investment by making a donation.
Wynne who comes from a family of small business owners launched GAIA bookstore with her husband in 1987 and immediately began turning a profit.
With its sunny comfortable interior GAIA eventually become one of the nation s largest spiritual bookstores with 250 author events annually and took in a 63 000 profit in 1997.
But GAIA which the city of Berkeley has officially designated a cultural institution will have to close at the end of March if Ms.
Wynne can t raise the 300 000 needed to get out of debt plus an additional 100 000 to keep running.
Though she would not provide detailed figures sales were down 200 000 in 1998 and she expects a significant loss.
It started last year as she watched her customers gravitate to the Internet.
Each month sales were down 20 percent from the same time the year before.
The red ink crested in November with a 37 percent drop.
She announced in December that she was shutting down but within days an anonymous longtime Berkeley resident stepped forward.
Wynne passed the word and the calls started coming in.
As of Friday GAIA had pulled in 45 000 in donations from as far away as New York and Ben AMP.
About 10 writers have volunteered to match proceeds brought in by their readings at GAIA.
Wynne said recently while taking a break at an American Booksellers Association meeting in San Francisco.
Avin Mark Domnitz the chief executive of the ABA said the only similar case he could think of was that of an anonymous donor who gave 1 million to a struggling South Carolina bookstore.
And unlike other companies that looked to investors for help Ms.
I think that this kind of expression of support from a community you may see more and more of as customers see the independent bookstore is threatened by outside bookstores Domnitz said.
Of the so called bricks and mortar bookstores that captured about 50 percent of the market in the second quarter of 1998 more than half of sales were generated in four chain stores.
Warehouse clubs like Costco and Kmart which also offer big discounts took another 49 percent according to the ABA.
And although online sellers currently have only a tiny 1 1 2 percent of the 12.
3 billion retail book market independent store owners believe they re making a significant dent.
Even GAIA part of which functions as a nonprofit community center is developing a Web site that will allow its techno savvy customers to buy online.
Not everyone in the industry expects independent stores to stay alive by running a capital campaign.
I think this is pretty much a one of a kind occurrence.
I can t see it happening very often said Kevin Howell an editor at trade magazine Publisher s Weekly.
It s very much a niche store as opposed to if it were just a general (interest).
Wellington s an independent bookstore in the technology saturated Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina was sold two years ago to 18 techies stay at home moms and retirees concerned about the 40 000 square foot Barnes AMP.
Noble against which the owner felt it would eventually become impossible to compete.
With Borders and Bookstar stores also in an area populated by a wealth of online 25 to 34 year olds Wellington s closed its doors in Cary on Feb.
INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS PLAN TO OPEN ONLINE STORE (DW).
NEW YORK Facing intensifying competition the nation s trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store Book Sense to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.
The online venture which is scheduled to open for business this summer is the most ambitious element in a series of countermeasures to promote independent bookstores by the American Booksellers Association the dominant trade group for a beleaguered fraternity that has seen its share of the popular consumer book market shrink to about 17 percent today from 32 percent in 1991.
Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition from superstore chains and online bookstores prompting some store owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are under siege.
The electronic bookstore and a planned national marketing campaign are the first collective efforts of an ordinarily disparate group of independents.
The goals is to compete against some of the forces that have reduced ABA membership to about 3 300 from 5 200 in 1992.
We re not trying to knock off the Goliaths I don t want to look naive said Hut Landon a bookstore owner in Mill Valley Calif.
and the executive director of the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association which developed the pilot concept last year.
We recognize that we ve got to do this in this day and age.
We can t just be quaint little booksellers in our community asking how the kids are.
The association already has organized a series of 12 customer focus groups along with the development of the electronic bookstore.
In its initial stages the store will feature all the standard functions of popular online sites including a search engine a stock of 1.
5 million titles credit card fulfillment gift wrapping distribution services and a best seller list.
But it will also allow individual stores to tailor Web pages to reflect their individuality with store reviews and features.
What we re really trying to do is find the different ways that we can do what our competitors are doing said Michael F.
Hoynes the association s newly hired marketing officer.
He said initial interest in the program was enthusiastic because booksellers have been asking for a collective approach.
will begin its first national marketing campaign in May for the Book Sense brand which in some ways is inspired by the example of the independent hardware stores that promote themselves under the True Value label.
The association plans to spend about 2 million to develop the electronic bookstore and about 2 million more on the marketing campaign money that comes in part from its half share of 25 million that the association won from Penguin Group USA in a dispute over favorable discounts that were given to large retail bookstore chains.
In Northern California where there is a strong and active group of independent booksellers the regional association has also spent about 100 000 to promote a common identity under the name Book Sense.
The brand and a slogan Independent Bookstores for Independent Minds are appearing in newspaper advertisements and on decals posters and plastic shopping bags in the Bay Area where more than 200 bookstores have signed up to participate in the pilot program.
But the collective approach envisioned by the national association is broader in scope conceivably allowing customers to order books online with the freedom to pick up or return a book at any participating Book Sense store.
The association is already in discussions with a national wholesaler Baker AMP.
Taylor to provide distribution services a critical element for an online service that caters to customers with swift delivery.
It is also considering expanding the electronic title base to include out of print books.
At this point the pricing system still is being determined although individual bookstore owners will have great flexibility to offer discounts on their templates said Len Vlahos the association s spokesman.
Within the next few months the association will start signing up members to participate in the electronic project which would cost bookstore owners monthly development fees expected to range from 175 to 450.
Several technology analysts said that the move was a vital step to protect the booksellers eroding turf and noted that the independents may be able to capitalize on strengths in ways that Amazon.
David Brodwin an associate partner with Andersen Consulting who follows electronic commerce said the Book Sense venture would draw on the loyalty of customers who prefer local bookstores over corporations.
Independents will feature locally relevant information travel restaurant guides local history with a degree of sophistication and connoisseurship that the nationwide players may have trouble matching Brodwin said.
He cautioned though that associations often move slowly.
That could present problems for success in electronic commerce which requires decisiveness and speed.
Kate Delhagen the director of online retail strategies for Forrester Research Inc.
a technology research company said that independent booksellers had no choice but to act because customers shopping habits were changing.
2 billion in book purchases will be made online this year she said.
Spending will rise in 2003 to almost 3 billion or about 18 percent of the book market she added.
The book lover in me is thrilled to hear about this for the independents Ms.
Banding together and forming a network is the only way.
This is a huge opportunity for them to survive because long term they re getting eviscerated.
This development presents them with an opportunity to say I m sticking around and we re not letting Amazon and Barnes AMP.
BOOK CHAIN S BID TO ACQUIRE BIG DISTRIBUTOR IS UNDER FIRE.
rattled the book industry with the seismic announcement of its acquisition of the nation s largest wholesaler Ingram Book Group the proposed merger is undergoing intense federal scrutiny and is now being investigated by the California attorney general s office.
When the 600 million purchase was announced in early November Barnes AMP.
Noble s top executives confidently predicted that the merger of the nation s largest bookseller and wholesaler would be completed in 35 to 45 days but the Federal Trade Commission s antitrust review has lingered longer than expected.
Independent booksellers meanwhile have organized one of the most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry with so many petitions e mails and telephone appeals to the FTC that the agency has set aside a special line just to record calls about the Ingram deal.
Noble Ingram merger please press one its voice mail system tells callers.
Noble s acquisition of Ingram a unit of Ingram Industries is undergoing a level of scrutiny from the FTC that is known as a second request review in general a rare move that allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed deal.
The length and type of the review does not necessarily mean the merger is in deep trouble.
Other recent book industry deals have faced intense reviews from Federal regulators but still were eventually approved.
The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of inspection for its purchase of Simon AMP.
Schuster s education unit which was ultimately approved.
Bertelsmann AG s successful acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also received additional attention.
The Ingram deal has galvanized strong opposition from booksellers in California.
There a spokeswoman for the state attorney general said Friday that the agency was reviewing the deal.
We re investigating said the spokeswoman Sandra Michioku the director of public affairs for the attorney general Bill Lockyer.
The process is to look at what would be the impact of the merger and to make a decision whether it s anticompetitive.
Even if the FTC approves the merger California can ask a federal judge to block it said Ms.
Michioku who declined to comment on what prompted the state to get involved.
She said she knew of no other state that was investigating the merger.
The Connecticut attorney general s office is monitoring the FTC review although it is not conducting one itself.
Mary Ellen Keating a spokeswoman for Barnes AMP.
Noble in New York said the company was not aware of the California investigation although it did receive a letter from the state requesting information that the bookstore chain was providing to Federal investigators.
It s really not uncommon for a state attorney general to be interested in a transaction like this because there have been concerns raised about this Ms.
She noted that the company was confident that this acquisition will be approved.
In a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts Barnes AMP.
Noble s chairman and chief executive Leonard Riggio said that he expected a decision by the FTC in 60 to 90 days which would be sometime in June.
Ingram based in Nashville is the dominant force in book distribution.
Privately held it does not disclose its market share.
Noble s sales account for about 14 percent of the consumer book market.
In general the merger s opponents are worried that the Ingram purchase will give Barnes AMP.
Noble access to the sales data of independent competitors or allow it to stock its stores with popular books that might be in short supply while making a competitor like Amazon.
After the many recent mergers in the book industry some opponents of the Barnes AMP.
Noble Ingram deal said they believed it was getting more serious attention because they were being asked by the FTC to provide formal declarations of opposition.
This is the first time that we ve been asked for declarations and nothing like this has happened before with the struggle with Simon AMP.
Schuster and Bertelsmann and Random House said Letty Cottin Pogrebin the president of the Authors Guild in New York which challenged the other mergers.
Michael Cooper a Washington antitrust specialist who is not involved in the case said the request for declarations indicated that the federal review had reached a new level.
It suggests that they did reach a stage where they have problems and they are willing to go ahead and seek a preliminary injunction Cooper said.
He noted that declarations are normally collected in preparation for an injunction request or for use in persuading FTC commissioners to block a merger.
Some opponents of the merger took comfort from Ingram s announcement in March of a stategic alliance with Entertainment Marketing Information Services.
Through its Book Scan unit EMIS will take over the collection of sales data from independent bookstores that were previously polled by Ingram.
This move in the opponents view represents an effort to address the concern that Ingram might pass along information about independent booksellers to Barnes AMP.
Led by the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown N.
independent booksellers have conducted a letter writing campaign against the merger that has delivered the signatures of more than 115 000 book buyers to the FTC.
The independent booksellers also have held meetings with elected officials which have resulted in letters from officials like Sen.
Michael DeWine the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee s subcommittee on antitrust urging the federal agency to review the merger closely.
passed a resolution supporting the effort of independent booksellers to block the merger.
In San Francisco a long distance telephone and credit card company Working Assets organized a telephone campaign by its customers that resulted in 35 000 calls to the FTC to oppose the merger according to Janet Nudelman a director at the company.
Booksellers are not a particularly political group of folks said Oren Teicher who has been organizing the opposition for the American Booksellers Association.
SEATTLE (AP) Sandwiched between coffee bars and vintage clothing shops the Fremont Place Book Co.
has provided the city s hip young Fremont neighborhood with everything from obscure titles to bestsellers for more than a decade.
The owners of the store like hundreds who run independent bookstores nationwide fear being wiped out by chain owned megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles.
The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes AMP.
Noble the country s largest bookstore chain of Ingram Book Co.
For independent booksellers the 600 million deal is the last straw.
We were all just aghast when we heard about the deal says Carol Santoro co owner of Fremont Place.
Smaller booksellers worry the merger will allow Barnes AMP.
Santoro has responded by shifting orders to other suppliers.
But independent booksellers are not the only ones worried about self preservation in a changing industry.
Even a giant in the business like Ingram says it cannot overlook the impact of chain stores and online retailers in the market.
Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all transactions by 2002.
At the urging of several members of Congress including Democratic Sen.
Ron Wyden of Oregon and independent booksellers the Federal Trade Commission is looking into the deal between Ingram and Barnes AMP.
The state attorney general in California home to many independent booksellers also is investigating.
Wyden took up the cause because of personal exposure to the tough circumstances facing small booksellers.
His father was an author and ran his own publishing house for some years.
I was raised being skeptical about what is happening in the bookselling business Wyden said.
He supports conditions to the merger so all booksellers have equal access to published material.
He also favors firewalls to prevent information sharing.
Without such conditions Wyden believes the deal could be the death of the small stores.
I think this really is a survival issue for them Wyden said.
Independent bookstores have been on the offensive since the dawn of the mega bookstore when giants like Borders and Barnes AMP.
Noble opened up triple decker shops stocked with thousands of book titles CDs and even cappuccino bars.
Because of their high volume these stores were able to slash prices.
The online retail giant has revolutionized the market enabling shoppers to buy send and special order books with a click of the mouse.
In March the American Booksellers Association and other independent bookstores filed suit against the two retail book chains saying they have used their clout to secure illegal deals and preferential treatment from publishing houses.
Another suit filed by independent booksellers in August also names Amazon.
The ABA argues that the proposed deal between Ingram and Barnes AMP.
Noble will add to the stranglehold on independent booksellers and reduce the diversity of materials.
You wind up with a smaller and smaller group of people deciding who to publish said Len Vlahos of the ABA based in Tarrytown N.
While there will always be the John Grishams and other big moneymakers bookstores also need to make room for lesser known names.
You like to think artistic content matters says Santoro.
Ingram says it is reaching out to its clients to assure them of confidentiality in their transactions.
Predictions that the merger will reduce the variety of books available are just not true says Mary Ellen Keating of Barnes AMP.
We are going to make every book available she said.
But Wyden says independent bookstores do more than just sell books and often function as community centers.
The small stores help make rural life more vibrant Wyden said.
There s just a flavor that you re looking for said Diane Kerner of Seattle making her purchases at Fremont Place one rainy morning.
On the eve of its annual national convention the bookselling business has never seemed more like a business.
In the past 12 months the German conglomerate Bertelsmann AG completed its purchase of Random House Barnes AMP.
announced it would buy the world s largest wholesaler the Ingram Book Group and Bertelsmann and Barnes AMP.
Noble announced a joint investment in the on line seller barnesandnoble.
Meanwhile as big business gets bigger smaller business simply disappears.
Since the early 1990s bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5 200 to less than 3 500 much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion.
Perhaps a few parties and some California sun will make it all go away.
Booksellers publishers agents and authors are gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center for this year s BookExpo America.
The three day exhibition and trade show which starts Friday ends May 2.
The book business has never been more difficult nor more uncertain than it is now said Richard Howorth ABA president and owner of Square Books in Oxford Miss.
In 1997 about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes AMP.
Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores.
Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all transactions by 2002.
BEA won t turn that around but for a few days it gives independent sellers a chance to meet commiserate and plan.
One proposed change is to reduce the ABA s board of directors from 20 to nine.
We re trying to make the board more responsive more nimble and able to react quickly said Howorth because everything is changing so fast.
Losing customers both in cyberspace and in their neighborhoods independents are fighting back any way they can.
Noble and Borders for antitrust violations and is among those opposing the proposed Ingram sale which the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing.
The booksellers association is also creating its own on line selling site BookSense.
You can t just sit around and be a guy in the shop and think life is going to go on the way it s been Howorth said.
Publishers face a problem directly related to the convention.
introducing their fall books their main reason for coming to BookExpo.
Because of scheduling conflicts at the Convention Center this year s meeting will take place a month earlier than usual.
Frankly we haven t seen enough of our manuscripts to really feel comfortable said Laurie Brown vice president of marketing for Farrar Straus AMP.
We re cataloguing books we re not even sure are going to be ready on schedule.
But once in Los Angeles there will be plenty of time for promotions parties and seminars.
And at least around meal times the industry will pause and let the writers talk.
Featured speakers include Nobelist Elie Wiesel Pulitzer Prize winners Frank McCourt and Jorie Graham as well as Robert Stone Ward Just David Guterson and Nikki Giovanni.
Salman Rushdie on his first full fledged book tour since being sentenced to death 10 years ago by Iran s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is expected to appear.
But Rushdie is likely the only writer who will draw as big a crowd as the weekend s most quotable author Bill Murray the undoubtedly proud papa of A Cinderella Story.
Those looking forward to seeing the merry Murray bear hugging the sad eyed Wiesel will be disappointed.
Murray will not share the dais with Wiesel or any Pulitzer winners.
Instead his fellow breakfast speakers will include Frances Mayes a California based poet who writes about Italy and a celebrity whom Dan Aykroyd Murray s Saturday Night Live co star once parodied so well Julia Child.
LOS ANGELES (AP) I m a writer now Bill Murray announced to a crowd of publishers and booksellers and in order to give you a feeling for the book that I ve written I have come completely unprepared.
Murray co author of the golf book and memoir A Cinderella Story was speaking Saturday at BookExpo America the industry s annual convention.
He joked about his inability to meet deadlines apologized for exceeding his allotted speaking time and offered encouragement to all the independent booksellers in his own special way.
I ve never gone to the Internet and sat down and read anything he said.
LOS ANGELES (AP) Unhappy with an author they once honored independent booksellers overwhelmingly approved a resolution criticizing Frank McCourt for appearing in a television ad for the on line superstore barnesandnoble.
The American Booksellers Association with a core membership of some 3 300 independent stores voted Saturday at BookExpo America to draft a letter to McCourt expressing disappointment.
He is the author of the hugely popular Angela s Ashes and the upcoming sequel Tis.
I ve never asked for an apology in my life and I ve never given one.
If I get a letter from them it ll go back unopened said McCourt a featured speaker at BEA.
The expo a three day exhibition and trade show that ended Sunday is the publishing industry s annual national convention.
It was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
The ABA s letter will be sent to a beloved writer and not just with readers.
Two years ago the association presented McCourt its annual ABBY award given to the author whose book they most enjoyed selling.
His memoir was a surprise success and he has given a lot of the credit to independents.
If they (independent stores) had wanted me to do a commercial I would have done one for them too.
The resolution is actually far lighter than the original proposed by independent seller Andy Ross owner of Cody s Books Inc.
Ross condemning the hypocrisy of writers and intellectuals had wanted the ABA to call for McCourt to give back his ABBY award.
I really offered this resolution in a spirit to generate discussion Ross said.
They (writers) talk about independent booksellers at cocktail parties but they re afraid to speak up.
com include Tom Clancy and Stephen King another vocal supporter of independents.
In retrospect I understand how they feel but I never really anticipated it said Susan Moldow vice president and publisher of Scribner an imprint of Simon AMP.
Asked if he d do another superstore ad McCourt said I d be very careful the next time.
The ABA action highlighted a weekend of tough talk.
com and other bad corporate citizens of everything from false advertising to stealing customers.
We are fighting for our lives said ABA president Richard Howorth.
Booksellers received both bad news and good news at BEA.
A new consumer survey said that adults in the U.
bought 30 million fewer books in 1998 than the year before.
In good times consumers seem to spend their money on other kinds of entertainment or on more expensive durable goods.
In tighter economic times consumers once again think about books said Sandra Paul managing agent of the Book Industry Study Group which conducted the survey.
But the ABA which has lost nearly 2 000 stores over the past decade also reported a long hoped for statistic.
In March of this year the number of stores increased slightly the first monthly improvement in recent memory.
It s been going against us for a long time but it s going to go the other way said Avin Mark Domnitz the ABA s chief executive officer.
Meanwhile there was still plenty of time to talk about books.
Major upcoming releases include McCourt s new book.
Dutch Edmund Morris long awaited memoir about former President Ronald Reagan.
Sue Grafton s latest lettered mystery O is For Outlaw and Hannibal Thomas Harris sequel to The Silence of the Lambs.
BOOK SALES DROP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 7 SEVEN YEARS STUDY SHOWS.
LOS ANGELES The reviews are in for last year s books and the reading is not pleasant.
A new industry study indicates that the popular market for literature declined with the number of purchases dropping for the first time in seven years despite the growing presence of electronic bookstores and the easy availability of titles.
The widely publicized arrival of online booksellers has failed so far to expand the market for popular fiction and nonfiction even as demand has fallen for mass market paperback books and as affluent educated readers buy fewer titles according to the Book Industry Study Group a trade group that tracks the reading habits of 16 000 households.
That conclusion may defy the conventional wisdom of some of the top publishers who gathered in Southern California Sunday at the Los Angeles Convention Center for Book Expo America the annual and sometimes uneasy business reunion of independent booksellers and their suppliers.
A day before the release of the survey on Friday Peter Olson the chief executive of Random House the unit of Bertelsmann AG that is the nation s largest publisher appeared on a panel Bookselling in the Next Millennium.
During the discussion he insisted that book sales on line amounted to incremental growth rather than a shift of purchases from other traditional outlets.
But the new consumer research study indicates that sales over all declined almost 3 percent to 1.
04 billion books purchased literary spoils that were divided among a shifting group of booksellers.
For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category online stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share which declined less than one percentage point to 16.
The large bookstore chains raised their part of the market slightly to 25.
3 percent reflecting their own slowing expansion of brick and bookshelf stores.
The rest of the bookselling market includes everything from mail order companies to warehouse chains to food and drug stores.
With the widespread availability of books and the plethora of titles on the market booksellers struggled to understand why they were not reaching more readers.
The downturn in sales comes as the economy continues to thrive and the number of small independent publishers has grown in the last 10 years to more than 53 400 companies.
Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York stocked the vast convention center here with books hoping to appeal to independent booksellers.
By necessity those booksellers are banding together to create a common electronic bookstore of their own Book Sense which has now signed up more than 860 members.
Avin Domnitz the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association said the study reflected other research the trade group had conducted to prepare for the August start of the Book Sense site on the World Wide Web.
Young people in particular Domnitz said are so busy and so mobile that the acquisition of these things are just not on their priority list.
That group is reading he noted not necessarily traditional books but perhaps information on line.
Much of the softness in the market is attributable to the falling popularity of paperbacks.
those books once ushered in a revolution in popular reading because of their modest cost and easy portability.
The weakness of paperback sales took their toll on used bookstores book clubs mail order companies even drugstores all of which experienced declines in their shares of the market.
Mass market paperback sales sagged more than 21 percent at drugstores and 17 percent at used bookstores reflecting a shift in American reading habits by customers who may prefer the larger type of discounted hardcovers or more expensive trade paperbacks.
Cost may also have driven away potential customers.
the average price of paid for a paperback book outpaced the rate of inflation over the last five years rising to 4.
To deal with the age factor the Association of American Publishers has created an publicity campaign featuring celebrity bookworms and a slogan Get Caught Reading to try to reach the young but there s heavy work ahead.
In particular readers younger than 25 bought fewer books last year with purchases down by 20 percent.
Older customers between 55 and 64 remained loyal the study showed buying 15 percent more books.
Readers with annual incomes of more than 75 000 are usually heavy book buyers but last year they also cut back.
In general readers bought fewer fiction titles and pared even more on nonfiction like biographies and history which declined in sales by 12 percent.
The customers younger than 40 who did shift to online book shopping displayed rather different reading tastes than those of the general market.
Popular fiction topped E commerce sales at 33 percent followed by 14 percent for technical and science books 12 percent for cookbooks and crafts titles and 11 percent for psychological and recovery books.
In the general market popular fiction has a much more commanding presence 51 percent followed by religious titles at 10 percent and cookbooks at 9 percent.
The study notes that religious book buyers did not seem to respond to electronic bookstores but did buy enough titles in other outlets to expand the segment s share of the market by more than 1 percent.
Over all customers bought fewer books in every category except in categories for travel and religion.
Domnitz whose organization helped finance the study still believes there is a potential for expanding the market.
The problem is that about half of the population is not going to purchase books in the course of a year he said.
BOOKSELLERS BATTLE CHAINS WEB MERCHANTS AT ANNUAL EXPO.
LOS ANGELES There was no new John Grisham no new Anne Rice no new Tom Wolfe either.
But there was thank goodness a new Michael Crichton a new Scott Turow a new William Least Heat Moon plus Frank McCourt s eagerly anticipated sequel to Angela s Ashes and Thomas Harris long awaited sequel to The Silence of the Lambs.
So as the country s independent booksellers and publishers gathered last weekend for their annual prom now called BookExpo America there was reason for hope about upcoming books and the selling seasons ahead.
But then this is a national convention where the main commodity these days is irony.
Major publishers mounted massive displays that filled two halls of the mammoth Los Angeles Convention Center but found themselves hawking wares to an ever diminishing sector of the marketplace.
Independent booksellers have been assaulted first by chain superstores then Internet purveyors led by Seattle s Amazon.
com so the indies have seen their portion of the book market cut in half (to 16.
6 percent) during this decade and membership in their trade organization drop from 5 200 to 3 500.
The convention s first day also included the distressing announcement of a national study that found that despite a booming economy sales of books sold to adults dropped 3 percent last year.
Chain stores claimed 25 percent of sales while Internet purveyors (measured for the first time) claimed 2 percent as indie share continued its decline.
Things have gotten so grim for independents that they come to the annual confab of the American Booksellers Association wondering about the latest book stores killed in action and as bookseller John Barrigner of Charlotte N.
put it which of our good friends we won t see this year.
Worries about their fate have reached such a state that booksellers in their official annual meeting portion of the convention found themselves debating whether to censure McCourt winner of the Pulitzer Prize and one of the country s best selling authors.
The phenomenal success of Angela s Ashes had paid many bookseller bills since publication and it had been given an annual prize (the ABBY award) as the book that independents most enjoyed selling.
But McCourt had gone on to commit what some independents considered a traitorous act.
He had appeared in a TV commercial extolling the virtues of the Web site of Barnes AMP.
So a handful of upstart independents urged a censure of McCourt and a request that he return his ABBY.
The motion failed handily Saturday afternoon but only after a spirited and sometimes heated debate.
I m not political I don t know the details of the bookseller war McCourt said the next morning.
If I had known I might have thought twice about appearing in that ad.
I am in favor of independents but the big boys sell books too.
But if you look at the stores where I appeared on behalf of Angela s Ashes it was probably 15 to 1 in favor of independents.
The McCourt imbroglio was one of the few contentious moments at a convention repeatedly described as businesslike.
It may have been held in the city that defines glitz but the three day proceedings had a workmanlike air perhaps in part because the weather outside the hall was chilly and gray and offered little temptation.
Even a cocktail party at the Playboy Mansion to celebrate Grove Atlantic s upcoming publication of The Century of Sex undoubtedly the weekend s hottest ticket seemed deflated by the weather.
At poolside chairman Hugh Hefner looked distinctly chilly in his trademark smoking jacket and silk pajama pants and the two statuesque Playboy Bunnies in their skimpy costumes seemed in real danger of contracting chest colds.
The convention s estimated 29 000 visitors were encouraged by some marketplace moves by the ABA highlighted by the unveiling of the new Web site BookSense.
com which will allow individual independent stores to have their own customized presence on the Internet.
It will draw upon the strength of bookseller numbers and process orders from customers.
Throughout the weekend they crowded around demos of the Web site expected to be running within six months and a poster was often updated with the number of BookSense enrollees up to a robust 865 booksellers by Sunday afternoon.
Avin Domnitz ABA executive director was ecstatic.
When we started introducing BookSense at regional meetings we hoped to come to this convention with 300 stores enrolled so that it would be a legitimate program Domnitz said.
And we thought that if we left the convention with 500 stores we would have reached critical mass.
On the book front this fall s offerings seemed solid although no one book seemed to spark the kind of buzz that some books have enjoyed at past conventions.
Strong non fiction titles include memoirs by astronaut John Glenn (Bantam) Sen.
John McCain (Random House) and McCourt (Scribner).
and biographies of Hillary Clinton by Gail Sheehy (Random House) Jack Dempsey by Roger Kahn (Harcourt Brace) and Nelson Mandela by Anthony Sampson (Knopf).
There is also William Least Heat Moon s river journey across America (Houghton Mifflin).
Richard Rhodes timely examination of why people commit violent crimes (Knopf).
John Nathan s inside look at the rise and fall of Sony (Houghton Mifflin).
Seattle author Erik Larson s recreation of a 1900 Texas hurricane Isaac s Storm (Ballantine).
Susan Faludi s look at the plight of the American male Stiffed (Morrow).

Strong fiction titles include Turow s Personal Injuries (Farrar Straus) Crichton s Timeline (Knopf) Claire Messud s The Last Life (Harcourt Brace) Brian Herbert and Kevin J.
House Atreides (Bantam) and Harris Lambs sequel Hannibal (Dell).
The most eagerly awaited fall children s book hands down is the second Harry Potter book by British author J.
Rowling Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Scholastic).
The already published British edition has prompted an Internet shopping frenzy across borders.
3 ONLINE BOOK RETAILERS CUT PRICES ON BEST SELLERS.
the online retailer cut the prices on best selling books by 50 percent Monday a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals Barnesandnoble.
com all of whom will almost certainly lose money on the bargain rates.
Amazon s price cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for its No.
which has imminent plans for a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks.
com said the timing of its discounts on books from The New York Times best seller lists was a matter of coincidence.
There are three things that drive this business said Bill Curry a spokesman for Amazon.
We ve added convenience with distribution centers that will get merchandise faster to customers.
With a flurry of announcements on Monday the three electronic booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on The Times best seller lists.
That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any given week.
Generally publishers offer books to retailers for less than half of the list price which means that the electronic rivals will be losing money with these discounts on best sellers.
But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers who offered similar reasons for plunging ahead.
We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace said Leonard Riggio the chairman and chief executive of Barnes AMP.
Noble who added that Amazon has changed their prices in the middle of a public offering for Barnesandnoble.
I have to tell you that this is not the battlefield that we think we re going to win on in the long run said Rich Fahle a spokesman for Borders.
But we re not going to let this distinguish us from the competition.
None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50 percent discounts.
And in fact Amazon was issuing refunds on the difference in price to customers who bought best selling books shortly before its announcement of the discounts.
Kate Delhagen director of online retail strategies for Forrester Research Inc.
a technology research firm said the outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new competitive pressures.
There are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers to compare prices through Web site services such as Add All that instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers.
For example Monday that site compared the prices for more than 24 bookstores and prominently listed Amazon for offering the best price for the best selling children s novel Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone.
95 but with the discount and a shipping charge Amazon was selling the title for 12.
It s definitely a defensive strategy being deployed but it s also part of their increasing energy to add customers to their database.
Curry Amazon s spokesman declined to say whether the company would lose money on the 50 percent discounts.
We re just not talking about whether we re selling at a profit or a loss he said.
However Curry said Amazon has decreased its reliance on book distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers.
Those efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that Amazon is now passing along to its customers he said.
STAFF O FTC IS SAID TO OPPOSE BARNES AMP.
WASHINGTON The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has concluded that the planned merger between the nation s largest bookseller and its largest book wholesaler violates antitrust law and has recommended that the full commission step in to block Barnes AMP.
Noble s 600 million acquisition of Ingram Book Group a person involved in the deal said on Monday night.
The decision a significant victory for both publishers and independent booksellers which have waged a powerful campaign against the proposed deal since it was announced last year does not bode well for the planned acquisition.
Noble and Ingram a unit of Ingram Industries will try to make their case soon to the full commission.
And if the recommendations are upheld the two companies will have to decide whether it is worth waging a protracted and uncertain legal fight.
Mary Ellen Keating a spokeswoman for Barnes AMP.
Noble said on Monday night that the company had been working closely with the commission and was providing information that the agency had requested.
Noble proposed the merger during a period of consolidation and turmoil in the publishing and book selling industries.
Top executives from the company have hailed the deal as a rare opportunity to recognize great cost savings through consolidation.
Noble in particular has been in the middle of a buying binge as part of its response to growing competition on line particularly from Amazon.
com which started by relying almost exclusively on wholesalers to fill its orders remains dependent on the services of Ingram.
Ingram has been its leading supplier filling more than 58 percent of its orders according to Amazon.
Noble access to 11 distribution centers which would help it cut costs and reduce delivery time for its growing base of on line customers.
But from the moment the proposed deal was announced last November it was denounced by groups representing writers and smaller booksellers.
One group likened it to the marriage of Godzilla and King Kong.
The independent booksellers led by their trade group the American Booksellers Association have waged a fierce legal and letter writing campaign hoping to enlist not only the federal regulators but state antitrust officials as well.
For the independent booksellers the worst fears are that a new book conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes AMP.
Noble could ultimately affect issues like credit speed of delivery and access to popular titles that are in short supply.
Although Ingram which is based in Nashville is a dominant force in book distribution it does not disclose its market share.
Noble has about 14 percent of the retail book market.
com the New York based Authors Guild and others had filed papers with the Federal Trade Commission urging it to intervene and block the deal.
But the legal case has hardly been open and shut.
While federal regulators have been more rigorously examining proposed mergers during the Clinton administration than in earlier years they have taken on so called horizontal ones that is those between companies in the same line of business and have only rarely challenged vertical mergers involving businesses in different aspects of an industry like Barnes AMP.
Oren Teicher the chief operating officer of the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown N.
said he had not heard of the FTC staff s position on the merger but added that the association would be extremely gratified to see it blocked.
For the nation s bookstores Teicher said the merger would be terribly anticompetitive.
Many of the smaller bookstores rely on Ingram as the sole source for books though the larger stores typically place orders directly through publishers as well as through Ingram and the second largest wholesaler Baker AMP.
Independent booksellers had organized one of the most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry with so many petitions E mail messages and telephone appeals to the FTC that the agency had set aside a special line just to record calls about the Ingram deal.
The FTC has been performing what is known as a second request review a fairly uncommon procedure that allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed deal.
Other recent deals in the book industry faced intense reviews from federal regulators but were still eventually approved.
The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of inspection for its purchase of Simon AMP.
Schuster s education unit which was ultimately approved.
s successful acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also received additional attention.
Noble the world s largest bookstore chain called off its 600 million purchase of the world s biggest book distributor Wednesday because of opposition from antitrust regulators.
Noble and Ingram Book Group said they worried that their businesses would suffer during a prolonged review by the Federal Trade Commission.
Some FTC staff members had concluded that the merger could give Barnes AMP.
The review process has been disappointing to us Ingram chairman John R.
The events of the last several days have made it clear that some staff hold an outdated view of the marketplace making an objective analysis of the transaction impossible.
The deal has been under fire since it was announced in November.
Critics said it could allow Barnes AMP.
Noble to delay delivery of best sellers to independent stores and big rivals such as Borders or gain access to its competitors buying practices.
Noble however had said the acquisition would have allowed Ingram to distribute a wider selection of titles and Barnes AMP.
Noble to deliver books faster and at lower cost.
The American Booksellers Association which represents 3 400 independent bookstore companies had been the most vocal opponent of the proposed merger.
This shows that David can beat Goliath sometimes said Oren Teicher chief operating officer of the booksellers group.
When this proposed deal was first announced virtually nobody predicted that this deal could be stopped.
Small booksellers wrote letters made phone calls did everything to raise awareness of this issue and against extraordinary odds they have succeeded.
FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky did not deny that the commission was considering blocking the deal.
He cited concerns about whether small bookstores and Internet merchants would be injured if the merger were permitted.
Noble isn t the only company looking to expand its distribution network.
com are building and acquiring centers around the country to make it easier and faster to get any book to any customer.
Ingram a subsidiary of privately held Ingram Industries Inc.
distributes trade books audio tapes textbooks and specialty magazines through 11 distribution centers around the nation.
Noble said it will use the 600 million it had earmarked for the merger for other investments and acquisitions.
It will also go forward with plans to build two new distribution centers of its own one in Reno Nev.
NEW YORK (AP) Challenging Barnesandnoble.
com s claim that If we don t have your book nobody does a division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has called for the online bookseller to discontinue or modify the slogan.
If you were to interpret the slogan literally it would discourage searches from other sources Nicholas Vianna advertising review specialist with the group s National Advertising Division said Tuesday.
In the book industry there are private books local publishers all kinds of books.
Some of the independent sellers make their livelihood on that special niche market.
The American Booksellers Association which filed a complaint last December compiled a list of 100 out of print titles and found 24 that were available only through competitors of Barnesandnoble.
They included such obscure works as Cartels Combines AMP.
Trusts in Post War Germany and Studies in Machiavellianism.
A lot of independent booksellers complained because that slogan just wasn t accurate said Richard Howorth president of the ABA whose membership consists overwhelmingly of independent stores.
com agreed to comply with last week s decision as of Tuesday the slogan still appeared on its Web site.
We disagreed with the NAD s recommendation but chose to comply because we were moving away from that advertising slogan said Mary Ellen Keating a spokesperson for Barnes AMP.
We agreed to remove or modify the slogan over the next several months.
We would hope the changes would happen as soon as possible Vianna said.
The agreement calls for compliance within a reasonable period of time.
And several months seems too long especially in the case of a Web site.
The National Advertising Division is a self regulating body established by the advertising industry.
Compliance with NAD decisions is voluntary but some cases end up referred to the Federal Trade Commission.
BOOK SALES GREW 4 PERCENT LAST YEAR STUDY SHOWS.
After struggling through a drought in the mid 1990s when readers bought fewer copies of consumer books the publishing industry posted gains of more than 4 percent last year and is poised for more modest increases despite the rapid emergence of online booksellers.
In its annual snapshot of the word trade the Book Industry Study Group issued cautious sales projections for the glamour side of trade publishing which produces novels and nonfiction and a more radiant view of the future for college textbooks and business titles.
The unit sales of adult trade books are projected to grow more than 2 percent annually through the year 2003 an indication that online sales are not expected to increase the market for popular books.
We don t see the total market expanding in any dramatic shape for five years said Albert Greco an associate professor of business at Fordham University who helped prepare the projections.
I think people are reading less and I just don t see that we re going to turn the corner and become a nation of readers.
In 1998 the sales of adult hard cover and trade paperback books the top moneymakers for trade publishers rose by more than 4 percent from a year earlier to 497 million copies.
It was the second year of growth in unit sales after a two period ending in 1996 when consumers cut back on their purchases.
Children s books also made gains emerging from a 1997 slump to sell more than 364 million copies in 1998 a gain of 6 percent.
The study does not include figures for 1999 but several top publishers say they are experiencing a surge in sales that encompasses not only popular fare like Hannibal by Thomas Harris or the Harry Potter children s series by J.
Rowling but also histories like John Keegan s The First World War.
We ve seen a strong market since last summer all publishing divisions all formats all categories said Peter Olson the chief executive of Random House the Bertelsmann AG unit that is the largest trade publisher in the United States.
Olson gave credit for some of the strength to online retailers that now account for roughly 4 to 5 percent of the company s sales.
6 billion for the fiscal year that ended in June had exceeded expectations.
The North American side of the company in the United States and Canada accounted for about 80 percent of all sales.
com have generated has increased interest in books in general and that has led to buying not just online but in stores Olson said.
Using consumer diaries of book purchases an earlier industry study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books in the same period last year.
But the trade organization speculates that the discrepancy may be because that study did not include acquisitions made by libraries.
Though the industry study does not predict an expansion of the market because of online sales its current sales figures indicate that electronic publishing and bookselling are reshaping the market in other ways.
For example the unit sales of books about science and technology declined from a peak of 80 million copies in 1995 falling 8 percent to 74 million copies last year.
And those drops are expected to continue the result of a shift to electronic publishing that is distribution of books by disk CD ROM or over the Internet by technical publishers like Bertelsmann s Springer Verlag unit in New York.
In the last few weeks Springer has transformed Prokaryotes a four volume 2 000 set of books about bacteria into an electronic version that will sell for less than half that price.
Ruediger Gebauer Springer s chief executive said that no one was sure yet whether electronic publishing would expand the market.
But he expected that the electronic versions would make such books accessible to many more people.
The libraries in theory keep information to everybody he said.
Online publishing opens it up to virtually everybody.
The Book Industry Study Group report also suggests that the Internet and online book sales may figure in the continuing fall off in mail order purchases which has dropped 26 percent from a high of 105 million copies in 1993.
Religious books for instance are not sold in high volumes by electronic booksellers but sales in that category continue to improve increasing almost 16 percent to 170 million copies since 1993.
And those numbers do not include sales figures from thriving fundamentalist Christian publishers.
You ve got an aging population and I think as people go on in life they turn to more spiritual matters said Eric Major director of the Doubleday religious division for Random House.
Oddly enough we ve seen a surge in books about the lives of saints or books about people s religious experiences.
The great thing about this area of religion publishing is that it now includes business books parenting books dieting books and relationships books.
The sales of textbooks for college and elementary students also continue to grow.
At the university level sales grew more than 19 percent to 176 million copies between 1993 and 1998.
But those trends have not necessarily raised sales by the 80 or so university presses in the United States.
The sales of university books grew by almost 4 percent to 18.
And the report projects only modest increases for the next five years.
That s an indication of a mature market said Peter Givler executive director of the Association of American University Presses a trade organization.
The sales for university presses have been flat for a couple of years and the presses are looking for new sources of revenues.
Some university presses are starting to experiment by publishing electronic journals he said but to date it is unclear to the members whether online bookselling and electronic publishing will be a boon.
Online bookselling has had this extraordinary growth Givler said but nobody knows how that is going to play out.
It seems that everybody thinks this is a logical way to purchase books and there ought to be some way to work it out but we haven t found a way to do it.
BERTELSMANN PLANNING TO MERGE 2 WITH BOOK CLUB GIANTS.
Less than a year and a half after buying the nation s premier publishing house the Bertelsmann media conglomerate is poised to form a partnership with an American icon of popular literature Time Inc.
Bertelsmann which is based in Gutersloh Germany and purchased Random House last year is negotiating to create a joint venture that could bring together the two largest book clubs in the United States the Book of the Month Club and Bertelsmann s Literary Guild according to publishing executives who asked to remain anonymous.
Both clubs have been pondering how to compete against online booksellers in a book market radically changed from the days when judges made Book of the Month Club selections over sherry that had the power to spread literary culture to readers isolated far from bookstores.
Bertelsmann s Doubleday Direct of which the Literary Guild is a part has been negotiating with Time Inc.
for more than six weeks in an effort to strike a deal this month.
But both sides have not reached an agreement yet on the financial terms or determined which company would operate the club according to publishing executives close to the negotiations.
The companies have made tentative plans to create a six member board presiding over the joint venture that will be evenly divided between executives of Bertelsmann and Time Warner Time Inc.
We are declining politely but firmly to comment said Peter Costiglio a spokesman for Time Inc.
spokeswoman for Bertelsmann also would not comment.
However one publishing executive familiar with the negotiations said that a joint venture would enable the two book clubs to cut costs by sharing back end functions such as distribution and warehousing.
The problem is that book club sales growth has been hurt by a couple of factors most prominently online book sales he said.
In the case of the Book of the Month Club they ve really been struggling over the last couple of years so this is an opportunity to put some operational systems together.
Such fierce competition obviously did not exist when the Book of the Month Club s founder Harry Scherman invented the book club in the United States in 1926 with a gimmick that relied on a literary stamp of approval from experts like Heywood Broun and Christopher Morley who selected the best new books for a reading public hungry for literature.
The general book club strategy has been to entice a reader with promotional offers like a four book purchase for 2 if the customer agrees to buy a specified number of other titles at regular prices.
For readers living far from a bookstore the system offered a convenient alternative.
But with the rise of online bookselling and instant purchases at the click of a computer mouse book clubs in the late 1990s were forced to offer something more than discounts.
They have tremendous costs in finding new members said Albert N.
Greco an associate business professor at Fordham University who tracks book publishing.
If these two clubs could cut down on their promotion and mailing costs they could save a lot of money.
During the 1990s consolidation narrowed the chief players in the book club business to three companies Bertelsmann s Doubleday Direct Time Inc.
s Book of the Month Club and Rodale Press UR.
six holdings including the health oriented Prevention Book Club.
To counter online competition the book clubs refined their marketing techniques and promoted their ability to filter choice books on specialty topics for harried readers who did not have the time to do it themselves.
The Book of the Month Club sells general hardcover titles but it also includes eight other clubs that offer books in niche markets like the One Spirit Christian Book Club or the History Book Club.
Last year the Book of the Month Club s revenues were estimated at about 280 million roughly comparable to the revenues of Doubleday Direct.
8 million with book clubs that include the Literary Guild as well as a collection of other smaller clubs like the fast growing Christian club Crossings and a children s book club.
The most recent statistics from the Association of American Publishers indicate that the books clubs have been holding their own but executives complain they have not been growing as fast as online booksellers.
Mail order companies like Readers Digest that have suffered from a free fall in sales which have plunged as much as 20 percent from a year earlier.
For the year through October net sales for book clubs had reached 950 million an increase of 4.
2 billion in book club sales that category accounted for 5.
4 percent of the total 22 billion book market that includes consumer books textbooks and professional titles.
Bertelsmann also has a substantial stake in the online business with a 40 percent interest in Barnesandnoble.
will allow the two literary clubs to remain in their present locations with separate identities the Book of the Month Club in Manhattan and the Literary Guild in Garden City N.
BOOKSELLERS WANT CALIFORNIA TO TAX INTERNET SALES.
SAN FRANCISCO A coalition of California booksellers is urging the state to be more forceful in collecting taxes from on line bookstores.
At a gathering in San Francisco the group of independent shopkeepers took specific aim at three giants of e commerce.
We demand the state s Board of Equalization collects sales tax as existing law requires said Hut Landon owner of Landon Books in Corte Madera.
This is an instance where the state is handing major retailers a huge advantage.
The request to the state agency was made by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association and the American Booksellers Association.
It s clearly discriminatory said Neal Sofman who hosted the event at his own store A Clean Well Lighted Place for Books on Van Ness Avenue.
If this imbalance remains we ll lose our tax base.
When asked about the request of the bookstore owners Board of Equalization Chairman Johan Klehs said the state is indeed enforcing the existing tax code.
In California the rules for e commerce are the same as catalog selling Klehs said.
If you have a nexus in California or employees in California you re required to collect sales tax.
Advisory Committee on Electronic Commerce is considering whether to tax transactions that take place on the Internet.
The 1998 law creating the study commission placed a three year moratorium on new taxes targeting Internet services or Internet access services.
The law does not exempt e commerce companies from having to pay state sales taxes.
Andy Ross who owns Cody s Books in Berkeley said he first complained to the state in July and has received little satisfaction from the Board of Equalization so far.
Tax policy should not be politicized said Ross who went on to accuse the Board of Equalization of bowing to Silicon Valley pressure.
com are not collecting taxes in clear violation of the law.
The state and national booksellers associations maintain that the three on line booksellers have a formidable presence in California and that should count as an established nexus.
The idea that these are not California businesses is just nonsense said Bill Petrocelli owner of Book Passage in Corte Madera.
Large Internet commerce people are being given a free ride.
Rich Prem a tax partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte AMP.
Touche in San Francisco sides with the on line retailers saying they are doing nothing wrong.
The way the current tax laws work the position that Amazon Barnes AMP.
Noble and Borders are taking is legal Prem said.
The fact that they re not collecting sales tax is perfectly legal.
Prem said a little known or enforced tax called the use tax could be the answer to the Internet taxation riddle.
It s a tax that s imposed on a purchaser that buys something from out of state and brings it into the state to use it Prem said.
BOSTON Inside the Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop the e commerce revolution seems improbable like a setting ripped from a Robert Louis Stevenson novel on the store s dusty shelves.
Hence the resident cat Blue who sleeps in the front window the classical music and the hand scrawled sign that says Please Touch The Books.
However the charming store encloses a hidden world one where touching the books is impossible where silence reigns and where Blue is nothing more than a flickering image.
com and last year it generated 6 percent of McCaffrey s sales.
We have to have the Web said McCaffrey peering down nearly empty aisles on a recent afternoon.
I ve got 150 000 books here and I might offend the typical Bostonian by saying this but there aren t enough people here who read.
Battered by chain stores and the on line giant Amazon.
com one out of every three of New England s independent booksellers has created sophisticated yet quirky Web sites in the past two years in an effort to lure patrons and keep their doors open.
To their happy surprise the reluctant on line entrepreneurs are finding cyberspace fertile beyond their wildest hopes as readers in Australia and Japan purchase what locals ignore.
Many owners now admit that the Internet may mean the salvation and not the destruction of their brick and mortar book nooks after all.
At the same time however these famously disorganized capitalists are finding out how tough it is to balance the digital and the down to earth.
Successful Internet ventures have begun to distract owners from the business of selling books to walk in customers eroding the character and charm that made independents unique many proprietors fear.
I don t want my bookstore to be the Wal Mart of the Web said Frank Kramer owner of the esteemed Harvard Book Store in Cambridge.
We want the Web to drive people to our store that s the goal.
The fact is we have tremendous potential on the Internet and could increase our sales tremendously but we enjoy physical retailing.
Ken Gloss owner of the historic Brattle Book Shop in downtown Boston takes great pains to ensure that walk in customers get treated as well as his on line patrons whose mounting orders take more and more time to process.
Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make available in the store first Gloss said.
We don t want our in store customers to feel like they re left out.
What many proprietors are finding out is that loyal customers were waiting for their chance to enjoy the convenience of on line shopping without having to buy books from the massive corporate Web sellers like Barnes AMP.
I shop on line because it s convenient because I have to said Frances Burke a professor emeritus at Suffolk University as she bought a book at Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop.
As a cradle of the high tech economy the Boston area was perhaps destined for the vanguard of on line book selling.
com created in 1993 was the world s second on line bookstore followed closely by Harvard.
But the movement was slow to take off as shopkeepers either could not afford to create a Web site or saw the creation of one as a violation of their store s identity.
In January 1996 only 10 shops in the region had Web sites and two years later 10 more had joined them.
Today however nearly 150 of the region s 470 independent booksellers many teetering on the brink of bankruptcy have Web sites according to the New England Booksellers Association (NEBA).
That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association the nation s other storied association of bookstore proprietors.
We ve seen a six fold increase in the past two years said Wayne Rusty Drugan the NEBA s executive director.
For some shops the high tech effort consists of little more than a few pretty photographs directions to the store a telephone number and some staff recommendations of good reads.
I d have to have a crew of 20 people working constantly to get all my books on the Web site said Gloss whose site holds just a smattering of his collection.
Lacking the resources to offer millions of titles like Amazon.
com some owners have instead focused on recreating the intangible qualities of their shops on line.
McCaffrey has a page devoted to Blue for instance.
Gloss offers photos of handsome leatherbound tomes.
The virtual bookstores they admit are pathetic by comparison with the real thing.
On the computer screen there s no texture no depth Kramer said.
I don t care how many graphics you have it doesn t compare to the table the shelves the overstock area the books at the front counter.
That has a dimension computer screens cannot accomplish.
To make up for the physical shortcomings of the Internet many storeowners have invested in Web sites that offer depth of stock on line ordering and other conveniences.
Most now offer search engines that allow surfers to comb entire store inventories or even to tap into databases of every book in print.
In effect many tiny shops on the corner now have the capability of offerring the same number of books as the massive retail chains like Barnes AMP.
Wordsworth s general manager Sanj Kharbanda said his store s Web site now holds about 1.
2 million titles enough variety to bring in about 125 on line sales a day.
That converts to roughly 9 percent of total sales on a given day he said.
In this day and age the minimum expectation is that we would have a Web site and being a bookstore a search function has become a necessary convenience Kharbanda said.
And at the Boston Book Company which occupies a less than glamorous second floor stie in the city s Jamaica Plain neighborhood Internet sales now account for half the shop s sales co owner Helen Kelly said.
The reason she said is the plentiful title list on the store s Web site.
Even the slickest home pages however seem hopelessly grounded in the physical world no matter how virtual the shopping experience.
Few independent booksellers take the time to create customer profiles or track shoppers habits and even fewer have employees dedicated solely to working with on line customers.
As Richard Howorth president of the American Booksellers Association and owner of a small bookstore in Mississippi said I have no idea how many hits I get.
Such apparent disdain for mimicking the widely imitated strategies of Amazon.
Anirvan Chatterjee founder of Bookfinder.
com where on line book buyers browse inventories of thousands of independent bookshops around the world said on line book indexes like his have helped independents offer books that appear nowhere on their shelves.
With such resources available to booksellers who go on line there s plenty of financial sense in shuttering storefronts and doing business solely in cyberspace Chatterjee said.
A lot of sellers are finding that their on line presence subsidizes their storefront.
Independent booksellers are a famously fractious group as the name suggests.
In their two decades war against chain stores and more recently online booksellers they have shared little beyond common enemies Barnes AMP.
Noble Borders Amazon the price clubs and a will to survive.
Isolated from one another in neighborhoods across America they have fought a guerrilla war with discouraging results.
Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994 according to the American Booksellers Association.
Now the Internet the site of so much recent loss for the independents will take on greater importance as a battleground in the next two months.
Set to debut are two large scale Web sites that seek to promote the independents.
But many wonder whether the sites are jumping in too late and can compete with the customer service of the online giants Amazon.
On June 6 the booksellers association will begin to unveil Booksense.
com a site turning the independents into local store dot com closed but open 24 hours a day says Michael Hoynes the program s marketing officer.
Next to come in early July is Contentville a site produced by Steven T.
Brill which will according to its senior vice president and e publisher Annik LaFarge make some 40 of the most respected booksellers in the country the heart and soul of its book retailing area.
The sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their books.
com is a hub site for hundreds of individual Web sites created and maintained by local stores.
What is unusual about Contentville s relationship with the independent booksellers it has recruited Glenn Goldman of Book Soup in Los Angeles Neal Sofman of A Clean Well Lighted Place in San Francisco and a former ABA president Ed Morrow of Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center Vt.
among others is that the independents will not actually be selling books on Contentville.
Instead they will provide editorial content for a fee and will get an equity stake in the company should Contentville go public.
Sara Farley an e commerce analyst at PaineWebber believes the biggest issue for the new sites lies in customer service exactly the territory the independents in Booksense.
The trick she says is providing a great customer experience.
Amazon has spent five years developing a complicated and hopefully very robust distribution and fulfillment network.
To meet the challenge the sites have established alliances with Baker AMP.
Taylor and Ingram wholesalers that have traditionally dealt in bulk orders to booksellers and now face the challenge of shipping smaller orders directly to consumers homes.
Ingram for example has worked over the last two years to improve its ability to ship smaller orders to more customers and over the last year has developed this operation in earnest delivering books for Barnesandnoble.
Ingram has a cash investment in Contentville which gives us reassurance they ll do it right said Brill.
com has reached similar distribution agreements with Baker AMP.
The wholesalers ability to deliver on their promises is crucial says Lorraine Shanley a publishing consultant at Market Partners.
The online component of bookselling is difficult for people without the resources and organizational savvy of Amazon she said.
The obstacle she says is the same as it was for Barnes AMP.
They are trying to jerry rig entrenched systems as opposed to building a Web based transactional business which is what Amazon did she said.
com says customer service will be the strength of the program.
The local store itself will be point of customer contact he said.
There s an actual person in the store which has many more years of customer service experience than Amazon.
But the question still remains whether the Internet plays to the independents strengths as retailers.
Online booksellers can t replicate the experience of browsing and buying books in a store says Jeffrey Fieler consumer Internet analyst at Bear Stearns.
Though he acknowledges that the independents have to do something or they will be marginalized even further he is skeptical that a niche retailer can develop a significant market share in a category already well served on the Web.
Last year according to Fieler people visited an average of 15 sites a month.
This year he says the number has shrunk to 10.
People are finding the places that meet their needs he says.
The larger sites in each area are adding functionality so that people don t need to go to other sites.
com which has been delayed since the fall by technical problems grows out of Booksense a national marketing umbrella launched by the booksellers association for its beleaguered members in February 1999.
In the last 16 months Booksense has attracted 1 154 stores across the country to its offline program.
It offers among other features a bestseller list drawn from members stores gift certificates redeemable at any affiliated store (allowing direct competition with the ubiquity of the chains) and national advertising promoting independents reading recommendations.
com charges participants a set up fee a monthly maintenance fee and takes 4.
5 percent in commissions on orders shipped from wholesale partners.
6 million in advertising promotion and public relations in the last quarter alone though Amazon sells more than books.
Local marketing by the independents themselves together with significant in store promotion of the individual Web sites is seen as key to Booksense s viability.
Fieler also sees risks in this limited approach.
Partnerships with other sites that command large shares of Internet traffic such as Barnes and Noble s relationship with AOL or Amazon s relationship with Yahoo will be crucial for the venture he said.
Research from the American Booksellers Association shows Hoynes says that the typical customer of an independent bookstore buys an average of 20 books a year but only eight of those at an independent store.
nn Contentville has significantly more marketing clout and will sell more than books.
content from newspapers and magazines as well as e books dissertations and other material.
It will spend 75 million in advertising over the next two years according to Brill who estimates that books will account for 25 to 30 percent of the site s total revenue.
Both NBC and CBS have invested in Contentville and the site will be advertised on the networks beginning in July in some markets.
The Contentville independents will create a variety of editorial features including recommended libraries of essential books in various categories If You Ask Me endorsements of books they love and new books they are enthusiastic about.
There will also be store bestseller lists and Buzz on the Floor notes on local happenings that have helped sales of certain titles.
But Shanley questions whether the local flavor will help on the Web where virtual communities are more important than land based ones.
The new sites are complementary Contentville will have pages that point back to Web sites that may be part of Booksense.
This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the programs.
com and Contentville can all act to remind consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice.
BRITISH AIRWAYS IN EARLY TALKS WITH KLM QL.
Amid renewed pressure in the airline industry to consolidate British Airways has had informal merger talks with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines executives close to both companies said.

Many traditional retailers have vowed that by integrating their Web operations into their physical stores they will eventually bury Internet only merchants.
But even as these companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public some of the best known merchants are telling government regulators that their Internet and physical world operations are distinct and separate businesses and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of maintaining separate operations.

CHICAGO (AP) When bookstore owner Michael Powell arrived at BookExpo America his schedule included leading a seminar on electronic publishing.
He soon discovered he was the one who needed leading.
I figured I knew as much as anybody about it Powell said.
By Friday I realized everything I said was wrong.
Fortunately everything everybody else said was wrong too.
If you listened carefully the past few days at McCormick Place you could hear the sound of heads being scratched eyes opening and minds processing it all.
BookExpo America which ended Sunday both confirmed and continued the rise of digital media in the publishing industry.
Lectures and panel discussions on e books electronic rights and related issues attracted standing room only crowds.
The most talked about speaker wasn t a writer but the founder and CEO of Amazon.
Companies either ignored or nonexistent two years ago found themselves with all the attention they could handle.
There seems to be a dot in every sentence now said Stephen Corrick a literary agent based in Chicago.
It s been around the fringes but this is the first time it s gotten to the middle of the discussion.
After a year marked by Stephen King s electronic novella Riding the Bullet and multimillion dollar investments by everyone from Microsoft to Random House few were doubting that online bookselling and print on demand would catch on.
Some said in a decade or three years or six months.
I think people will see this as one of the most significant moments in publishing history Powell said.
Statistics released over the weekend confirmed how quickly the market is changing.
A study reported that books sold online tripled their market share between 1998 and 1999 from 1.
More than 50 million titles were purchased by adults and no one doubts that number will increase significantly next year.
There is nothing we can imagine slowing down that trend said Barrie Rappaport of NPD Group Inc.
So far the ones most in danger of being damaged by Internet sales appear to be independent stores which already have been hurt badly by superstore chains.

We don t know which medium will be carrying the message but I still think paper will be carrying the vast bulk for a long time said Wendy J.
Strothman an executive vice president at Houghton Mifflin.
The Internet is very exciting but you miss that opportunity for customers to browse that serendipity of finding a book on the front table of an independent bookstore.
