19920404000000000	FT  04 APR 92 / Motoring: Renault passes road Czech - Stuart Marshall enjoys driving the new Safrane to Prague. AS THE Renault Safrane bumped over the tram tracks and splashed through the puddled, patched tarmac, the rain turned into sleet. Pilsen last week looked about as inviting as a Welsh mining town on a wet March day. Superficially, nothing seemed to have changed much since last I drove in Czechoslovakia 10 years ago. Then, although we had all the right paperwork, it took more than an hour for the frontier guards to allow us in. As we waited, we watched their dogs sniffing the undersides of lorries hauling gravel over the border into Germany, while more guards probed the loads with steel rods. They took care in those days that no Czech citizens escaped. When we flew out of Prague, there were locked security doors through which to pass before reaching the airline check-in desk, and again at immigration. The city was beautiful, but Czechoslovakia was not a happy country. Every 10th person seemed to be a uniformed official. One difference now is that Prague taxis are new Volkswagen Passats, not creaking old Volgas, and there has been an import boom in second-hand German cars. Czech motorists no longer have to choose between an appalling Trabant, Moskvich or Wartburg or, if luckier, a rear-engined Skoda or a Lada. There are plenty of newish Renaults, Opels, Fiats and VW Golfs on the lightly-trafficked roads,although aged and battered Skoda Octavias survive in rural areas. This time, though, I did not even have to stop at the border when leaving the country. A guard, seeing my British passport held up, just smiled and waved me through. That was when I realised things really were different. The new Renault Safrane I drove from Prague to Zurich made its debut at the Geneva show last month and will reach Britain by autumn. It is a replacement for the Renault 25, which never made much of a mark in the UK. That was not the case in France where, even in the last year of its life, it outsold the much newer Peugeot 605 and Citroen XM combined. The Safrane is Renault's bid for a larger slice of the market for top-of-the-range, volume-produced cars. Rivals include the BMW 5-Series, Rover 800, Saab 9000 and, of course, the 605 and XM from the PSA Group. Last year, 1.8m of the nearly 13.5m cars sold in Europe were in the Safrane's size and price class. The affluent Germans bought nearly 44 per cent of them; France, Britain and Italy took around 11 per cent each. So, while Renault's main target clearly is the German buyer, it hopes to sell about 7,000 Safranes in the UK each year. Initially, Britain will be offered only two-litre, four-cylinder and three-litre, V6 models. Mainland Europeans will have a much wider choice, including a petrol 2.2-litre and a pair of turbo-diesels. The Safrane could be taken for a saloon with a separate boot but, like the 25, is actually a five-door. This seems odd when you recall how Ford was bruised by adverse reaction to its hatchback-only policy for the present Granada/Scorpio range. (It added a four-door a couple of years ago, and its long-awaited estate car version arrives in a few days). But Renault, while admitting that some Germans are not too keen on large hatchbacks, thinks the Safrane's virtues will overcome this drawback. In two days and more than 500 miles (800 kms) of driving on everything from dry roads to packed snow, and in weather ranging from brilliant sunshine to blizzard, you get to know a car quite well. Both the three-litre V6s - one a five-speed manual, the other a four-speed automatic - impressed me as vigorous, comfortable and, above all, very quiet and refined mechanically. Their suspensions dealt nobly and almost silently with rough roads. At 130 mph (210 kmh) and over, they felt reassuringly stable and still ran quietly on the Autobahn. Next day, I switched to a Safrane with a 2.2-litre, 12-valve, four-cylinder engine developing 140 horsepower compared with the V6's 170 bhp. It went nearly as well as the V6 on the Autobahn but, with little more than half the three-litre engine's torque (pulling power), lacked a certain urge on hills and demanded more gear-shifting. The Safrane is a roomy five-seater with a generous boot. At the bottom of the range, ABS brakes will be an optional extra; but the poshest V6 will come with everything from leather seats to a self-levelling suspension that lowers the car automatically for high-speed driving. UK prices have not been fixed, but it would be surprising if a two-litre Safrane with automatic transmission were priced at around the present tax-break figure of Pounds 19,250.
19921207000000000	FT  07 DEC 92 / Armed police patrol the City. ARMED City of London police are conducting random road checks and the force has placed cameras on buildings around the City to monitor potential terrorist activity. The City force is also calling on businesses to make sure their own external security cameras are functioning properly. Private security video recordings have proved to be a vital source of evidence on terrorist movements. Elsewhere in London, Metropolitan Police set up armed roadblocks at the weekend in an attempt to detect terrorist movements and reassure the public. Both London police forces say they are relying on increased public vigilance in the fight against the IRA's threatened Christmas bombing campaign. The forces are working together but they have different approaches to the sensitive issue of armed officers and protection of the public. City firearms officers carry their weapons openly but their counterparts in the Met are under orders to keep them out of sight unless they are needed. In the Met area, vehicles are searched in a 'sterile zone' between the roadside and a solid line of police vehicles. Pedestrians and traffic are diverted to the far side of the barricade. In the City, pedestrians are free to walk past the search operation and there is no barricade between it and passing traffic. In activities on Friday and Saturday night, up to 45 armed police, dog handlers and traffic officers stopped and searched more than 80 vehicles, mostly vans, at roadblocks in locations around the east end of London, where police believe an IRA cell is based. No weapons, explosives or terrorist suspects were found in the operation, codenamed Rolling Rock, but similar activities are likely in future. The legal powers to conduct random checks have existed for some time, but have not been used in London before. The new tactic was a response to the IRA's recent bombing campaign using vans packed with large amounts of explosive parked outside buildings or near road junctions. Several explosions have been prevented after suspicious vans were noticed already parked by their targets or while on the move. The Lord Mayor of London, Mr Francis McWilliams, has written to the prime minister saying that the 'serious problems' between insurers and the government over cover for commercial property damaged by terrorists must be resolved urgently before uninsurability affects foreign investment and London's commercial property. The Association of British Insurers, which has recommended its members to exclude terrorist damage from new commercial policies, said that some insurers were considering cancelling existing policies on 30 days' notice, rather than waiting for them to expire.

19921127000000000	FT  27 NOV 92 / Argentina picks its way through pension maze: A scheme to introduce private funds. EVERY Wednesday about 500 pensioners gather outside Argentina's Congress to protest about their pitiful benefits and demand more money, only to face riot police, dogs and, on some occasions, armoured vehicles. Militant pensioners have tried storming the Supreme Court and one has threatened to burn down Congress. The plight of Argentina's 4.2m pensioners has become a political issue that makes the government appear indifferent to the social costs of economic reform. Private pensions were seen as a way out of the dilemma. As well as ridding itself of costly, corrupt and insufficient state schemes, the government hoped such pensions would improve companies' competitiveness by reducing payroll taxes and breathing life into capital markets. Argentina aimed to have its private scheme in place by January, but trade union and Congress opposition has delayed approval all year. Yesterday, however, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said he was confident a tripartite council from government, trade unions and business would agree a compromise version that would ensure congressional approval before Christmas. Mr Walter Schulthess, social security secretary, promises: 'There is going to be a total transformation of the pensions system in Argentina.' He has designed a hybrid scheme retaining some features of the state-run pay-as-you-go system while copying features of a scheme operating in Chile and introducing a mechanism to tide over existing contributors. Initially the state will pay out a minimum benefit equivalent to about 20 per cent of the economy's average wage to all who have contributed to pension funds for at least 30 years. Those who have contributed for longer than this will get a 2 per cent annual premium for each year over the 30-year limit. The state will also compensate people who are already paying into the state system with a credit equivalent to 2 per cent of the economy's average wage for each year's contribution, with an upper limit of 30 years. Thus, contributors to the old system will be entitled to benefits equivalent to 60 per cent of the average wage when reaching the retirement age of 65, plus an automatic minimum benefit of 20 per cent of average wages. These two state-run schemes will be funded by a 16 per cent payroll tax paid by employers plus a fixed slice of tax revenues. Finally there is a compulsory private pension fund scheme similar to Chile's, funded by a 10-11 per cent wage deduction. Employees will channel the money directly to a savings account held at a pension fund company. Contributors will be free to pick and choose among competing funds, creating competitive pressure to provide good service. Mr Schulthess promises the private system will be 'strongly supervised by totally independent regulators, since there will be strict norms on where funds can be invested, that stipulate maximum amounts that can be invested in each instrument.' Compulsory credit ratings, both of companies issuing paper and of each fund's investments, will limit the scope for fraud. The government will also create several reserve and emergency funds topped up by the management funds themselves. Part of the money will come from a mechanism limiting profits. Any fund that yields 30 per cent over the pension system's annual average yield will have to pay excess profits into the reserve funds, a sure way of discouraging high-yielding but risky investments. If there is a weakness in the system, it is regulation; Argentina has an atrocious record of corrupt and incompetent state supervision and private-sector fraud.
19930104000000000	FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Europe Today - Frontier-free Europe to work harder. Drug-sniffing dogs at Dover and other international borders will have to work harder in a frontier-free Europe as illegal traders look for a boom in single market crime. Security officials say there will be no let-up in the fight against drug smugglers. They will also be watching for the illegal movement of explosives, high technology goods of military potential, pornography, artworks, and endangered species. Border law-enforcers carrying out spot checks on vehicles and people are now mobile, and - if governments can agree on a headquarters for Europol organisation - police co-operation on terrorism and drugs should improve.
19900118000000000	COUPLE SUSPECTED OF PLANNING FATAL ROBBERY ARRESTED. A man and a woman suspected of masterminding an armored car robbery in East Los Angeles have been arrested, but the two gunmen who pulled off the heist and shot a courier to death remained at large Wednesday. Anthony Salas, 29, a guard for the Federal Armored Express company, was slain as he made a pick-up Tuesday at a crowded Department of Motor Vehicles office on Mission Drive. It was the sixth holdup of an armored car courier in the Los Angeles area in the last year, and it prompted the DMV to seek added security for its Los Angeles offices. Using attack dogs and helicopters, police scoured the neighborhoods surrounding the DMV office after the shooting. A red 1982 Toyota Celica that police said the gunmen had fled in was found about a mile away. The car was registered to an apartment address in the 1700 block of Cherokee Avenue in Hollywood. Late Tuesday, detectives armed with search warrants went to the apartment and arrested Mirna Guerra, 19, and Oscar Mendoza, 22. Both are from El Salvador and were booked on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, police spokesmen said. They were being held in jail without bail. Another man arrested with the pair at the apartment was booked on an unrelated misdemeanor warrant. He was identified as Gil Sanchez, 19. "We believe they (Guerra and Mendoza) were involved in the planning of the robbery," Lt. Fred Nixon said. The LAPD spokesman would not elaborate but added that the actual triggerman and an accomplice were still being sought. In a house-to-house search of the area surrounding the DMV office, police also found a discarded duffel bag containing more than $10,000 stolen in the holdup, as well as guns and clothing allegedly used by the suspects. Salas, the slain courier, had arrived at the DMV office shortly before 1 p.m. Tuesday, entered the vault area, dropped off one bag and picked up another containing receipts, checks and cash. His partner had remained inside the armored car, in accordance with company policy. As Salas neared the exit, two men -- one with a pistol drawn -- approached him from behind. The gunman shot Salas in the back and head, and he was pronounced dead on the scene. The DMV office was reopened Wednesday but eight employees -- among an estimated 50 to 60 employees and customers who witnessed the shooting -- said they were too distraught to work and were given the day off, DMV spokesman Bill Gengler said. "The events of yesterday got to them," he said. "They were very emotionally upset." In addition, the DMV has asked State Police to post additional guards and take other security measures at several of its offices in the Los Angeles area. Gengler said the added security will be a temporary measure. Although State Police officers are frequently posted at DMV installations, none was assigned to the Mission Road office on Tuesday. An armed investigator with security and other duties was present however, Gengler said. Despite the flurry of armored car robberies, police said they have not been able to link the DMV holdup to the earlier crimes. "There's nothing to show there's a connection," Nixon said.
19900121000000000	DRUG WAR: WRONG FORCES, WRONG FRONT. In a matter of weeks, the United States switched from fighting the Cold War to fighting the drug war. The invasion of Panama ushered in the new era; we will pay any price, bear any burden, to combat the drug menace. A Marine patrol has already fired on suspected traffickers crossing the Mexican border and the Pentagon drafted plans (now on hold) to mount a naval blockade off the coast of Colombia. President Bush, who will attend a summit with Andean leaders next month in Cartegena, plans to spend $2 billion over the next five years to fight drugs in the region. None of this is likely to make much difference. Overseas, the war on drugs, despite last week's reported surrender by a Colombian cartel, is shaping up as a loser. To understand why, we must examine the nature of the U.S. buildup in Latin America. The war is led by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters. The bureau controls an interregional air wing of more than 50 aircraft, including fixed-wing, C-123 cargo transports and Vietnam-era helicopters. The aircraft are used to ferry troops, move supplies and, most important, spray crops. Today, the State Department unit is dousing coca, marijuana and poppy fields in Colombia, Guatemala, Belize, Jamaica and Mexico. While the bureau controls the skies, the Drug Enforcement Administration runs the ground show. Traditionally assigned to the domestic drug trade, DEA is strengthening its presence in Latin America. Today, more than 150 agents work in 17 countries. Agency personnel are also more and more involved in paramilitary actions in the coca-rich regions of South America, where, armed with machine guns and jungle knives, they stage helicopter raids on processing labs and clandestine airstrips. The Central Intelligence Agency also expands its presence in Latin America, with new agents assigned to Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and elsewhere. At CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., a Counter-Narcotics Center collates the steady stream of data coming in from agents, informants, wiretaps, radar and satellites. Next, the Pentagon. Even as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announces major cuts in defense spending, the U.S. Southern Command in Panama is preparing to step up activities throughout Latin America. Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the commander, has already made several trips to Andean nations, canvassing the needs of local military and police chiefs. Arms shipments grow. In 1988, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia received a total of $3 million in military aid; this year the total will be $170 million. Even agencies with little history of involvement in Latin America are enlisting. The U.S. Customs Service has dispatched agents across the continent to assist local forces in sealing borders, controlling highways and training dogs to sniff parcels at airports. The Coast Guard has sent mobile training teams to instruct local policemen in river interdiction. Washington is on full drug-war footing. But its warriors are likely to slip when engaging the enemy, their generals committing the same errors as predecessors who fought the war against communism in Latin America. First, there's the friendly dictator syndrome. Just as Washington frequently cozied up to despots like Anastasio Somoza and Francois Duvalier because of their opposition to communism, it now embraces similar characters whose only redeeming quality is strong opposition to drugs. Take Haiti. Gen. Prosper Avril became president in a 1988 military coup; he has repeatedly reneged on promises to hold free elections and respect human rights. But he has moved aggressively against cocaine traffickers. "The (Avril) government . . . has expressed a firm commitment to cutting the flow of illegal drugs through Haiti," the State Department said in its 1989 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. "Despite political turmoil, the Haitians have maintained drug interdiction efforts and cooperated closely with U.S. authorities." "Political turmoil" included disappearances, killings and popular clamorings for democracy. After Panama, such chumminess is dismaying. For years, Washington overlooked Manuel A. Noriega's involvement in drugs because of his usefulness in fighting communism. The lesson seems lost; the United States woos other Noriega-like figures. Washington's emerging weakness for anti-drug strongmen highlights a broader flaw in drug policy -- a predilection for military solutions to problems that are primarily social and economic in origin. With unemployment soaring, prices skyrocketing and governments paralyzed by external debt and corruption, destitute peasants have turned to coca as a dependable means of income. Only economic development and crop-substitution programs offer a realistic chance of getting these farmers off coca. So far, the United States has displayed little interest in the economic roots of the cocaine problem. U.S. agents spend far more time with generals and police chiefs than with agrarian planners and peasant representatives. Just as 10 years of military intervention in Central America failed to bring peace to the region, current reliance on interdiction and law enforcement is unlikely to stem the flow of cocaine into the United States. Last week's reputed offer by the "Extraditables," a group believed to speak for the Medellin cartel -- to end the violence and get out of the narcotics trade in exchange for amnesty -- doesn't mean Colombia has won its war against the drug lords. President Bush and Colombian President Virgilio Barco are rightly skeptical of the feeler. But as recent polls in Colombia show, the people would favor exploring such a deal. Any arrangement that might end the bloodshed should not be ignored. But an agreement between the Colombian government and the cartel does not guarantee diminished exports of cocaine to the United States. For every Medellin drug lord thinking about retirement, there are dozens of traffickers waiting to take his place. The Cali drug cartel also does business in Colombia; it may expand, having been spared by the government offensive. As long as Americans demand cocaine, South Americans will supply it. Latin America's cocaine industry now extends over an area nearly as large as the continental United States. It employs millions of people, generates tens of billions of dollars. The narcos have huge stockpiles of sophisticated arms and maintain private armies that, in some cases, dwarf those of the established security forces. Add weak governments that barely control their national territories and it's enough to make one nostalgic for the Cold War.
19890207000000000	ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; COUNTYWIDE; $500 REWARD OFFERED FOR LOST POLICE DOG. The Orange County Police Canine Assn. has offered a $500 reward for the return of a German shepherd that ran away from the Santa Ana police canine unit Monday after strong winds blew open a wooden gate at its handler's Westminster home. Vasko, a 5-year-old, male German shepherd, disappeared from the home of Officer Mike Fleet, near Springdale Drive and the San Diego Freeway, between midnight and 5 a.m., Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Fleet's family dog, a 6-month-old, black and white Alaskan malamute named Nakita, also ran away. Vasko, described as "very friendly," has an identification number, GH2999, tattooed inside his right ear. Vasko is used primarily in crime scene searches and searches for narcotics and missing persons, Thomas said. The dog also is used in demonstrations at Orange County schools. Thomas said Vasko obeys commands in both German and English and does not have a collar.
19900212000000000	6 FELONS, INCLUDING 3 KILLERS, CUT BARS TO FLEE ILLINOIS PRISON; 1 CAUGHT. Six convicts, including three murderers, escaped from the maximum-security Joliet Correctional Center early Sunday, apparently by cutting through metal bars, state police said. One was captured later in the day. The escapees, most in their 20s and all in segregation cells as disciplinary problems, were considered extremely dangerous, authorities said. Tommy Munoz was captured shortly after 5:30 p.m. at a cousin's Chicago home by officers who had staked it out, state Department of Corrections spokesman Nic Howell said. Munoz, 22, was serving a sentence for narcotics violations and intimidation. A search with dogs and an airplane was called off because the escapees apparently split up, state police trooper Thomas Miller said. The prisoners escaped from the segregation cells, authorities said. Four of the inmates were doubled up in cells and the other two were in cells alone. Reports of when the prisoners escaped changed over the course of the day. State police originally reported the men were discovered missing at 4:55 a.m., but Howell said later that the discovery was made after a 7 a.m. inmate count came up short. About 100 corrections officers specially trained to deal with escapes assisted state police and local law enforcement officers in the search. The inmates had to cut through bars on the cells, break a window, cut through bars outside the window and cross a fence to get away, Howell said. "Obviously, this is a breach of security," he said. "They shouldn't have had the materials to be able to cut with and should not have been able to cut like this without being noticed." The prison, which has been plagued by overcrowding in recent years, is one of the state's four maximum-security facilities and one of two in Joliet.
19900216000000000	LIFE'S A BLAST. Most years, the bomb squad at the Orange County Sheriff's Department is as busy as the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff's departments combined. The squad's seven staff members and two dogs handle close to three calls a day. The team provides Orange County's 29 cities with complete combustible care. But does Orange County fit the profile of a place in need of an elite force of fuse-snuffers? According to Lt. George Johnson, bomb squad manager, the average bomb-builder fits right in with Orange County demographics. "Playing with bombs is not a ghetto crime," he notes. "Generally, bomb-builders are white males in their early 20s with an above-average education. Building a bomb requires a little foresight, a little planning, a little knowledge and a little more sophistication than, say, committing a crime with a gun." If January is indicative of the 1990 trend, the team will have to expand its staff. In the first seven days of the new year, nine bombings were investigated. And since 1987, calls have increased each year. Aside from investigating bomb explosions, the squad disposes of dangerous, unstable chemicals that often turn up in high school chemistry labs. And while not every call uncovers a bomb in a briefcase, ultimate care is used to handle each situation. "Right now, my people still have all their fingers and toes," Johnson says. "We'd like to keep it that way." Here's a look at bomb-squad activity during the last five years:  Source: Orange County Sheriff's Department
19890221000000000	GREEK COURT DROPS WEAPONS CHARGE ON ARAB WANTED IN U.S.. A Palestinian sought by the United States in the 1982 bombing of a Pan American jetliner was cleared Monday of illegal weapons charges after a homemade knife was found in his prison cell. The court decision came after an anonymous telephone caller said a bomb had been planted in the heavily guarded courthouse. Bomb squad units with dogs searched the court in Piraeus, Athens' main port, for two hours but failed to find any explosives. The trial then resumed and Mohammed Rashid, 39, was cleared of the misdemeanor weapons charges. He was returned to Korydallos prison, where he has been jailed since his arrest in Piraeus in May. "I had it (the knife) because I fear for my life. I also fear they may extradite me to the United States," Rashid told reporters in the courtroom.  Found During Jail Search Prison guards found the knife and a file in Rashid's cell during a random search on Friday. "I don't think the objects found in his cell could really be used to harm anyone," prosecutor Zacharias Kokkinakis told the court. The three-member panel of judges acted on the prosecutor's suggestion and voted 2 to 1 in favor of acquitting Rashid. Rashid is wanted by U.S. authorities on charges of planting a bomb that exploded aboard a Pan Am jet over Hawaii. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 people were injured in the blast. The explosion blew a hole in the fuselage, but the plane was able to land safely in Hawaii. The Greek Supreme Court twice has delayed a decision on whether to extradite Rashid. The case was further delayed last month when three Supreme Court judges resigned after a terrorist group responsible for killing a Supreme Court prosecutor threatened to act against court officials if Rashid were extradited. Washington has called the case a test of Greek willingness to cooperate in the fight against terrorism and warned Athens that relations could be damaged unless Rashid is handed over. Rashid was arrested after a U.S. tip last May when he was in Greece on a four-day transit visa. He served five months in jail for using a false Syrian passport and has been held since, pending a decision on extradition.
19890222000000000	CZECH WRITER SENTENCED TO 9 MONTHS; HAVEL CONVICTED FOR PROTEST AMID COMMUNIST CRACKDOWN. Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel was convicted Tuesday for his role in an unauthorized rally and sentenced to nine months in prison as Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities persevered in their hard-line stance against human rights activists and opposition forces. Havel, who was taken to and from a closely guarded courtroom in a sealed police van, had been in custody since his arrest Jan. 16 during a demonstration to honor the memory of a youth who burned himself to death to protest the Soviet invasion that crushed the "Prague Spring" reform movement in 1968. The playwright was charged with inciting citizens to take part in banned demonstrations and with obstructing police. Before he was sentenced, Havel, 52, told Helena Hvalata, the presiding criminal court judge, that he did not feel guilty and that the charges against him were not proven. He suggested that the authorities will one day be forced to "open a dialogue with society, not excluding anyone." Havel defended the activities of Charter 77, the human rights declaration that he helped write 12 years ago, arguing that he had often warned the authorities that resistance to reform would lead to increased public disaffection. "Warning voices of this kind were not listened to," Havel said, "and today the present power harvests what it has sown, the fruits of its own proud attitude." Havel's trial took place in a courtroom on a narrow street sealed off by uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Representatives from international human rights agencies were barred, but Havel's wife, Olga, and his brother, Ivan, were present.  53 Others Charged During his trial, 53 other defendants were facing similar charges in courtrooms throughout the city. Seven other leading dissidents arrested in the memorial demonstrations, which spread over four days beginning Jan 15, were being tried together, and their cases were expected to be decided today. The specific charges against Havel, in the view of Western diplomats and representatives of human rights groups gathered outside the court building, were virtually irrelevant. The object of the proceeding, they said, was to use Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident as an example to show that the authorities have no intention of taking part in the reforms sweeping other East European countries. The demonstrations that led to the arrest of Havel and the others were among the most sustained protests in Czechoslovakia in nearly 20 years. The stern police response, which included the use of tear gas, water cannon and dogs, brought widespread shock to Czechoslovaks, who had assumed that frequent government references to "radical reform" meant that a measure of tolerance had crept into the system. However, the government and the Communist Party apparatus seem to be firmly in the hands of officials whose rise to power followed the crackdown that came at the end of the 1968 reform movement. Any liberalization of the system, most observers say, would be taken as a decisive reversal for those officials.  'Closed Off Options' "They realize that any liberalization would mean the end of them," said Jiri Dienstbier, an opposition activist and journalist. "They have closed off any other options." The hard-line stance of the Czechoslovak party bosses has been criticized not only by Western-based human rights organizations but by Communist Hungary and Poland, where officials have argued that further delay in undertaking reform could worsen Czechoslovakia's economic and political situation. Recent high-ranking visitors from both countries, diplomatic sources have indicated, urged party leaders to open a dialogue with the opposition. The Czechoslovak authorities, however, seem determined to hold to their hard-line course. Dissident activists say the authorities are concerned especially about containing a growing mood of discontent among young people, 18 to 25 years old, who have no memory of the 1968 events and have grown bolder in their protests in recent months. Dissidents say that of the seven activists being tried together, the harshest sentence may be given to Jana Petrova, 22, who has emerged as one of the young people's leaders. "They want to teach the youth a lesson," Dienstbier said. "I am afraid the sentences of Petrova and the others will be for the maximum." The maximum sentences are two years for incitement and six months for obstructing police.  New Laws Against Protests The authorities recently introduced new laws to prevent demonstrations and protests, including fines of up to $1,000 and jail terms for those who fail to heed police warnings to disperse from any event that officials feel is provocative. The bite of the new regulations was evident outside the court building where Havel was tried. Scores of police officers were taking the names of passers-by and people lingering in the street, and anyone so recorded was subject to arrest and prosecution if caught on the street after an initial warning to move on. About 200 Charter 77 supporters managed to get into the court building early in the day, but they were cleared out after the court took a brief break for lunch. Havel was seen by only a few of them, and only for a moment, as he passed through a hallway dressed in jeans and a brown sweater. His brother, Ivan, said he spoke to Havel for a few moments after the sentencing. "I think he was in a good condition and in a good mood," he said. "He said he was touched by the local and international support, and he said his mood from this was more important than the sentence." Havel has had frequent brushes with the authorities since the early 1970s. He spent nearly four years in prison, from 1979 to 1983, and since then has been a frequent target for police harassment. With his internationally acclaimed status as a playwright, he has been the nation's leading dissident voice and a constant thorn in the side of the regime. Among his plays, generally starkly modern, are "The Temptation," which will open in New York this spring; "The Garden Party," and "The Memorandum."
19890222000000000	A COP'S BEST FRIEND. Santa Ana Police Officer Judy Stanbra hasn't talked to her partner in 18 months. Yet they went to school together. They walk the beat together. They even live together. But even though they aren't great conversationalists, Stanbra says, she and her partner get along quite well. Stanbra's partner is a dog -- Sammy, a 4-year-old Belgian malinois. "He's my partner during the day, but he becomes a pet at home," said Stanbra, an animal lover who, besides Sammy, lives with two civilian dogs. Stanbra, 31, is a 7 1/2-year police veteran. She has long had an interest in veterinary medicine and said she applied for the canine unit because she enjoys "being outside and working with animals." "One of the reasons we picked her is because she had a special feeling working with animals," said Sgt. Raul Luna, head of Santa Ana Police Department's six-member canine unit. "She was excellent in training." Five of the department's dogs are Belgian malinois imported from the Netherlands, where they are trained by Dutch police before being sent to Santa Ana. (The sixth canine is a German shepherd.) The police officer and the dog then train together for 5 weeks before they begin patrolling the streets. Besides working together, they live together. The canine unit, which was started in February, 1982, is used primarily to assist in looking for suspects in buildings or other areas and in SWAT operations. "They're able to use their noses and give us a better chance of finding suspects," Stanbra said. "Dogs can also do the . . . (search) faster," Luna said.
19900303000000000	BEST WEAPON IN DRUG WAR MAY BE MAN'S BEST FRIEND. When Los Angeles police officer Don Leahan first spotted him, Frog was just another face behind bars, a mongrel with an attitude and a reputation for chewing couches. Leahan at once saw Frog's potential. "I saw that playfulness in him," Leahan said, "and I thought to myself, 'Now he will make a good dope dog."' Frog would become legendary as one of the nation's first and most effective narcotics-sniffing dogs. In eight years until his death in June, 1986, he ferreted out more than $155 million worth of heroin, cocaine and marijuana hidden in radios, false suitcase bottoms, cargo containers, cars and planes. He was challenged in court, cursed and threatened. And through it all, Leahan said, "all you had to do was pat him on the head and give him a toy. He was ready to go again." In the nation's multibillion-dollar war on drugs, it seems that nothing can beat the nose of a good dog. In the last decade, employment of the dogs has escalated from a novelty to a necessity for most law enforcement agencies. Police swear by them, smugglers fear them and judges tend to view them as one of the few parties in court whose objectivity is beyond reproach. Narcotics-sniffing dogs represent a bargain in a drug war being waged with $18-million radar blimps and command centers jammed with sophisticated electronic gear. They also tend to be less susceptible to bribes and similar scandals. "You have helicopters for surveillance and radios and patrol cars and investigators. But there is nothing you can rely on that will not break down or give you false leads . . . as a well-trained dog and handler," said Capt. Tim Simon, head of a multiagency regional drug task force in Orange County. Law enforcement officials say the dogs have become so effective that smugglers have put bounties on their heads to permanently sideline them. And although no attempted "hits" have been reported against dogs in the United States, officials say the idea is not so far-fetched. In 1985, 23 drug-sniffing dogs -- bought and trained with U.S. Narcotics Assistance Unit funds and sent to work the Bogota, Colombia, airport -- were killed by poison in their cages by suspected traffickers. Along the heavy drug-trafficking corridor of south Texas, narcotics smugglers are said by the U.S. Border Patrol to have offered $30,000 to anyone who kills Barco or Rocky, two of the agency's most effective dogs. Barco, an Airedale-Belgian malinois mix, has recorded more than $180 million in drug seizures at the small checkpoint of Falfurrias, Tex., just up the road from the Mexican border. Last September, it was the dark, moist snout of the Monrovia police department's Dandy, a German shepherd, that helped police find and seize 20 tons of cocaine in Sylmar valued at more than $6 billion -- the largest narcotics haul ever in the United States. His reaction to the warehouse persuaded a judge to issue a warrant for the place to be raided. Winston, a yellow Labrador working for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, was instrumental in the seizure of more than $5.2 million -- the second-largest cash seizure ever -- in suspected drug profits. Dogs have been known to "alert" -- pointing their noses or scratching at places where drugs are hidden -- to as little as one marijuana seed or somebody's drug-tainted breath. Although dogs have been used in police work for years, primarily for patrol duty, their use as narco-noses didn't gain widespread acceptance until about 10 years ago. Drugs were being illegally smuggled into the United States in record amounts, and police needed another tool to help them combat traffickers. U.S. Customs, which pioneered the use of narcotics dogs in 1974, was looked to as a model. Since then, hundreds of dogs have been trained and deployed throughout the United States, and increasing numbers of other countries -- Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Mexico among them -- have also adopted dog programs. The dogs are trained to search for odors associated with various narcotics and then rewarded, often with nothing more than a tug on a towel or playing fetch with a rubber ball, when they "alert" to the presence of the drug. Police officials say concealed drugs that would take a team of officers hours, if not days, to locate, can be tracked down by a dog in only minutes. Leahan recalled that Frog, a pit-bull mix, once signaled a "hit" on a large radio carried by a passenger at Los Angeles International Airport, but despite a long search, police could find nothing. "We looked everywhere," Leahan said, "and we kept coming up empty-handed. We turned on the radio and it played, so we assumed the batteries were OK. But Frog kept alerting to the radio. When we were about to give up, we found the radio was rigged to some kind of hearing-aid battery and the batteries we were looking at were filled with cocaine." Barco, the legendary Border Patrol canine, has uncovered shipments of marijuana and cocaine hidden in frozen fish, okra, garlic and onions, and once found several hundred pounds of cocaine sealed in airtight containers and floating in a truck's gas tank. Winston used his nose to lead Orange County officers to $2.8 million in drug-tainted cash and almost 4,000 pounds of cocaine, hidden in cedar chests and covered with mothballs. The Mississippi Highway Patrol's chocolate Labrador, Coco, is touted for his ability to sniff the scent of drugs in a car parked with 5,000 others in an airport parking lot. Judges have shown respect for the canines' capabilities. Often they will issue a search warrant when the scent of a narcotic is apparent to a dog but not investigators. Courts have consistently upheld the use of narcotics dogs in drug arrests, and in some cases have held them to be beyond reproach. When defense attorneys questioned the judgment of a narcotics dog in an Orange County case two years ago, Harbor Municipal Judge Selim H. Franklin remarked that the dog "has more credibility with me than most of the witnesses who have appeared before me." Not surprisingly, the dog, Winston, has more than $70 million in drug seizures to his credit. A dog's keen ability to detect and distinguish among various scents is legendary, but experts disagree on exactly how much better a dog can smell than a human. One thing seems certain, however: there is nothing, be it talcum powder, coffee, onions, diesel fuel or Ben-Gay, that can stifle the smell of narcotics for a trained dog. "When we walk into a room and smell chili," said Mark Walters, an Azusa police officer whose German shepherd, Kai, has netted more than $2 million worth of drugs in a year, "the dog is smelling the 25 or 30 ingredients that went into making that chili. It is an incredible ability." Experts say the traffickers have come up with nothing that can mask the smell of narcotics from dogs. In New York, Customs has reported two cases where canines in the "small dog" program -- these dogs sniff arriving international flight passengers -- correctly alerted to people who had swallowed cocaine stuffed in condoms. "Some people have used figures that the dog's sense of smell is a million times better than a human's," said Charles L. Truax, Los Angeles District K-9 supervisor for the Customs Service. "I don't know what it is but we have never been able to develop any kind of electronic or man-made device that can equal a dog." Truax said that in fiscal year 1989 alone, Customs' 80 dogs across the country were responsible for uncovering almost $800 million in illegal narcotics -- representing roughly 10% of the total seizures. In Miami alone, Customs dogs helped uncover $249 million in drugs last year. Police officials say the costs associated with dog programs are minimal given the payoff. Buying and training a dog in narcotics detection costs between $3,000 to $10,000, but after the initial expenditures there is little more than food and veterinary care. The cost compares favorably to that of the high-tech gadgetry employed in the drug war. For example, the much-heralded Aerostat blimps that tether at 10,000 feet and scan the U.S.-Mexican border with radar, looking for drug-smuggling aircraft, cost as much as $18 million each and $400 to $700 an hour to keep in the air. For fiscal 1989, Customs officials said, the five blimps covering the border from California to Brownsville, Tex., helped lead to the seizures of $774,000 in cash, 106,000 pounds of marijuana and 65,900 pounds of cocaine. "A couple of good dogs deployed in the right area can do that themselves at a fraction of the costs," said Simon, director of the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression Program. "You can have your fancy electronics; I'll take Winston." But as the popularity of canines has increased -- today hundreds of law enforcement agencies have them across the nation -- so has the sophistication level of their training and breeding. Like Customs officials, the LAPD's Leahan started off scouting for his dogs at animal shelters, looking for "just the right combination of playfulness and aggressiveness. Not aggressive as in mean, but as in the dog will do anything to find the dope." Other police departments have relied on a small cottage industry of professional dog-training centers that import their dogs from Europe, complete with pedigree papers and trained to heed commands in three languages. The difference in approach has led to a lively, if good-natured, debate over dogs and their inherent abilities to be trained, about poodles versus shepherds and the need for private handlers to import and train the animals. "Well, I think that blueblood stuff is just bull," Leahan said. "If you walked in with a skinny black-and-white dog, nobody would give you $10,000 for it, but he might make a hell of a dope dog. "Frog was like that. He didn't have a particularly good nose but he had a great attitude. I'd rather have a loyal employee with an IQ of 65 than a genius who didn't give a damn. Frog never could understand why three kilos of cocaine couldn't squeeze through a wall socket. He was kind of a bonehead, but very effective." Leahan said any dog with good retrieval instincts and a good nose -- "anything but those dogs with the smashed-up noses" -- are candidates for narcotics dogs, though most police agencies concede there is a prejudice against smaller dogs that don't fit the public's perception of a police dog. "You're not going to take a cocker spaniel and march him around with a macho cop. It just wouldn't look right," said Don Lambert, an Orange County Sheriff's investigator and Winston's handler. Customs does use beagles in its agriculture inspection program, and smaller dogs are utilized to search for drugs in confined places like airplanes and boats. But the dogs of choice, both for narcotics work and the more common patrol K-9, are the Belgian malinois, the Labrador retriever and the German shepherd. Outside of breeding, the competition among police agencies to boast of having "top dog" is equally intense. Juan Garcia, assistant chief of the McAllen, Tex., Border Patrol sector, considers Barco the most famous of America's drug-sniffing canines. "He's been on the cover of Dog World, and you know he's in the Guinness Book of World Records, the 1990 edition now available (in bookstores). That would be on page 46," Garcia said with unabashed pride. Other Border Patrol agents, Garcia said, refer to Barco as "the John Wayne of drug dogs." Leahan said "the most famous dog I knew was Frog," and while Frog had no pedigree and was at the pound when discovered, he could go nose-to-nose with any Border Patrol canine. And from Orange County, Simon countered that if Barco is John Wayne, Winston is "the John Houseman of dogs. He established a reputation the old-fashioned way -- he earned it."
19900314000000000	SIMI POLICE SEIZE BIG CACHES FOR CASH; RAIDS: THE DEPARTMENT HAS COLLECTED MORE THAN $1.7 MILLION AS ITS SHARE OF DRUG FORFEITURE FUNDS. AND IT'S EXPECTING MUCH MORE.. The Simi Valley Police Department, which last year was credited with the largest seizure of cocaine ever by law enforcement officers from Ventura County, has collected more than $1.7 million over the last five years as its share in the federal drug forfeiture program. Sometime in the future -- the police hope sooner rather than later -- the department will more than double that amount in one lump sum when it receives another $1.8 million already promised to it as the city's share of money seized from Colombian drug dealers and money launderers last summer. In addition, the department has claims to another $4.1 million in alleged drug money seized during various raids in Simi Valley that is still tied up in the courts because of lawsuits from alleged drug dealers who claim the money legally belongs to them and not to the police. The upshot is that the Simi Valley Police Department, which is confronted by one of the biggest Colombian drug networks now operating in Ventura County, has amassed some of the most sophisticated police technology in the county for use in its continuing skirmishes with Simi Valley drug dealers. Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said the city's share of drug forfeiture funds received so far has been used for the purchase of 9mm Baretta pistols and holsters for all of his department's 105 officers. In addition, the money has been spent on computers, cars and a van specially outfitted with sophisticated evidence-gathering equipment, including a fingerprint laser. He said the money is also used to pay the salaries of three narcotics officers and two DARE officers, who teach anti-drug classes at the elementary school level. The federal drug forfeiture program, established in 1984, allows local law enforcement agencies who work with federal agents to claim money and property seized in drug arrests. Police departments can receive up to 80% of the money or property they helped seize in narcotics raids involving federal investigations or prosecution, Lt. Robert Klamser said. The program requires that the money be used for law enforcement purposes and stipulates that it cannot be used to replace current city funding, Klamser said. Simi Valley, West Covina and Los Angeles police departments were among the first law enforcement agencies to receive money through the forfeiture program after a 1984 joint investigation of a cocaine ring, Klamser said. The Los Angeles Police Department received $1.4 million and Simi Valley and West Covina each received about $360,000 from that operation, according to police records. Seized assets are divided among participating agencies based on their participation in an investigation, Klamser said. For example, the Port Hueneme Police Department provided a narcotics-sniffing dog in a Simi Valley police investigation last August that led to the largest seizure of cocaine ever by authorities from Ventura County -- 2,068 pounds -- as well as $2.4 million in suspected drug profits. The dog's efforts are expected to yield a substantial amount of money -- the exact amount is yet to be determined -- for the 21-officer department. Port Hueneme Sgt. Dennis Fitzgerald said a year ago that his department received about $16,000 in federal forfeiture funds when it sniffed out more than $500,000 in suspected drug profits and several kilos of cocaine as part of a joint investigation with the Burbank Police Department. The department is also expected to receive one of two small planes seized last year as part of a U.S. Customs Service investigation. "The dogs have done a real good job," Fitzgerald said, adding that his department recently sold one of its two German shepherds to the Ventura County district attorney's office. "They're definitely worth their weight." Klamser agreed, saying his department has plans to purchase its own trained police dog because of the potential revenue it could generate. The federal forfeiture program is not without its drawbacks. The amount of time it takes for a local agency to receive a disbursement of federal forfeiture funds could take anywhere from a couple of months to a couple of years, Klamser said. "Generally, the larger the amount, the longer the wait," he said, noting that the department's claim of $4.1 million is still pending in court. In cases where the amounts of drug assets seized are less than $100,000, the federal agency involved, usually the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, is allowed to decide how much to return to local authorities. The state has a similar forfeiture program, but until recently it was easier for local law enforcement agencies to recoup a larger share of drug monies under the federal law, Klamser said. The main reason was that the state law made it more difficult to seize property and required that the majority of drug money go to mental health and anti-drug education programs, he said. However, the state law was amended in January, 1989, making it easier for law enforcement agencies to seize cash and other property believed to be the proceeds of drug dealing, said Ronald Janes, major crimes and narcotics supervisor with the Ventura County district attorney's office. The statute also no longer requires prosecutors to obtain criminal convictions before confiscating these items, Janes said. The new state law allocates about 85% of suspected drug profits to the police agency participating in the narcotics investigation, with the remainder going to the prosecuting agency and the state. Since the law was amended, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of local law enforcement agencies using it, Janes said. "We now have two attorneys who do nothing but forfeiture cases," he said.
19890322000000000	SCRIPPS RESEARCH VESSEL SEIZED AS TINY AMOUNT OF POT IS FOUND. A scientific research ship operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography has been seized by U. S. Customs officials in Honolulu after a search with dogs turned up a small amount of marijuana allegedly belonging to a low-ranking crewman. The seizure Monday of the Thomas Washington, a 209-foot vessel that is Scripps' second-largest research ship, was made under the federal government's controversial "zero tolerance" anti-drug campaign and is the second such seizure of a research ship in less than a year. Last May, Customs agents in San Diego seized the Atlantis II, the grand dame of the U. S. research fleet, after agents found a trace of marijuana in a crewman's shaving kit. The vessel, owned by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, wasn't formally returned for two months, though it was allowed to continue its scientific work. That seizure and others drew widespread public and congressional criticism and prompted Customs to quietly back away from some cases involving minuscule amounts of drugs or drug paraphernalia. The Coast Guard also modified its seizure policies. And just last month, the federal government further revised its policies, saying it would stop seizing fishing boats in cases in which only "personal amounts" of drugs are found. In the case of Monday's seizure, Customs officials conducted an "intensive search" of the Thomas Washington using drug-sniffing dogs. Authorities found 4.5 grams of marijuana hidden in a berth of crew member Kenneth G. Racca Jr., 28, a wiper who is from San Diego. The ship, which is owned by the Navy but has been operated by Scripps since 1965, left San Diego a year ago on a yearlong research cruise. When it docked in Honolulu on Monday, it was returning from Pago Pago in American Samoa. Scripps spokesman Chuck Colgan said the vessel was routinely searched by the ship's captain before docking at the University of Hawaii's Pier 45 in Honolulu Harbor in preparation for Customs. "We don't know why the dogs were there," said Colgan. "At this amount (of marijuana), we're not talking about smuggling. It's for personal use, if that." The boat carries a crew of 15 and about 15 scientists. Both crew members and scientists must sign a document acknowledging that no drugs will be tolerated on board. The Thomas Washington is scheduled to depart Honolulu on Saturday for a 30-day research cruise around Hawaii, and is due back in San Diego about May 29, Colgan said. But Scripps officials are worried that the seizure could be costly, if the ship is not allowed to leave. "Our hope is this matter can be resolved soon . . . and that Scripps can leave port on schedule," said Scripps' director Edward A. Frieman in a prepared statement. "Expeditions are planned years in advance and require the coordination of people and materials from very many organizations from around the world. A delay in the ship's departure from Honolulu would have a considerable adverse impact on the effectiveness and expense of the balance of the crew's operations."  Crewman to Appear in Court George Roberts, Customs Service district director in Honolulu, said Tuesday that the vessel could be returned to Scripps after an administrative petitioning process and payment of a fine. And another Customs official in Hawaii said, "We'll do all we can to expedite the release of this ship." Colgan, the Scripps spokesman, said the institution was not certain what it would have to do to get the boat released, but he said that Scripps hopes to avoid a fine, because no fine was levied in the Atlantis II seizure. Racca, the crew member, is scheduled to appear in federal court in Honolulu on Thursday, where he faces one charge each of importation and possession of a controlled substance. A court spokeswoman told the Associated Press that he would likely be fined and released. Colgan said Racca's duties as a wiper involved "spending his day wiping things off, like oily engines and things." John Miller, a spokesman for Customs in Los Angeles, said Tuesday that the agency has modified its zero-tolerance policy only in relation to commercial fishing vessels. The anti-drug crackdown, which began last spring, is still in force for all other vessels, including the one operated by Scripps, he said. Under zero tolerance, boats can be seized by Customs if even minute amounts of drugs are found on board. However, if small amounts of drugs are found on commercial fishing vessels, he said, the vessels are placed under "constructive seizure," meaning that the owners may continue operating the boats until their legal cases are resolved. Physical seizure of such boats might cause "undue hardship" on innocent owners who might be unaware of the actions of their crews, he said. Because the Scripps vessel is not a commercial fishing vessel, it was physically seized, Miller said. Since the zero-tolerance campaign began last spring, 17 boats have been seized by Customs in its Western region, which includes seven Western states, he said. All but two have been returned to their owners, he said. Either Scripps or the Navy has the right to appeal the seizure through legal channels, Miller said.
19890324000000000	POLICE KILL 2 MEN, WOUND WOMAN IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS. In separate shooting incidents, Los Angeles police officers killed a pair of suspected car thieves after chasing them into Culver City and critically wounded a knife-wielding woman in Hollywood, authorities said Thursday. An officer was shot in the wrist and a police dog was killed in the Culver City incident; a bystander was wounded in the head by a fragment from a police bullet in the Hollywood shooting. Both episodes occurred Wednesday night. The first began about 9:30 p.m., when Hollywood Division Sgt. Richard Dedmon, 39, was flagged down by a bail bondsman at Yucca Street and Whitley Avenue, police said. As Dedmon and the bondsman spoke, they were approached by Catherine Hernandez, 32, who appeared to be drunk, according to police reports. Dedmon ordered her to leave, but Hernandez instead pulled out a large folding knife and allegedly threatened the officer.  Eight Shots Fired Dedmon called for backup and, when other officers arrived, they shot Hernandez with a Taser gun, a device that fires electrically charged darts that temporarily incapacitate a person. Hernandez, however, pulled out the darts and jumped onto the hood of a parked car, police said. When she allegedly lunged at Officer Julie Boyer, 30, she, Dedmon and Officer Joan Leuck, 29, fired a total of eight rounds, striking Hernandez in the left leg, both arms, and the lower back. Hernandez was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was in stable condition Thursday afternoon. Hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Hernandez sustained eight wounds. Another woman walking across the street at the time of the shooting, Peggy Erickson, 18, was grazed in the left temple by a bullet fragment. She was treated at a hospital and released. The Culver City shooting occurred about 11 p.m, two hours after motorcycle officers from West Los Angeles chased two suspects in what turned out to be a stolen car. The pursuit ended at Washington Boulevard and Bledsoe Avenue in Culver City when the car crashed into a curb. After jumping out of the car, the driver, identified as Jorge Jaramillo, 17, of Silver Lake, fired once at officers, missing them, according to police. After other officers arrived, a house-by-house search was begun.  Officer, Dog Shot K-9 Officer John Hall, 41, and his dog, Liberty, were searching a garage in the 4100 block of Bledsoe Avenue when they were hit by gunfire from a storage room. Hall was shot in the right wrist; Liberty, a female Rottweiler, was struck in the chest. Although wounded, Hall returned fire and took up another position near the front of the garage. According to a Police Department press release, Jaramillo suddenly emerged from the storage room and Hall fired several more shots from his 9-millimeter pistol, fatally wounding him. A second K-9 officer, Sgt. Mark Mooring, 38, then sent his German shepherd, Friday, into the garage and found another suspect, Amir Abedi, 18, a San Fernando Valley resident. When he allegedly pointed a handgun at Mooring, the officer fired his pistol three times, killing Abedi. A .22-caliber revolver was recovered from the suspect, police said. Hall was in good condition at UCLA Medical Center where he was treated for a fractured arm. Liberty, who had participated in 250 searches and was credited with 103 arrests in two years on the force, died at a local veterinary office. Wednesday's shooting was not the first for Mooring and Hall, both 17-year veterans of the department, records show.  Suspect Killed Last June, both officers participated in the killing of a 16-year-old burglary suspect, who had fatally shot a rookie police officer minutes earlier. After the suspect was found in the attic of a North Hollywood house, Hall and Mooring were among four officers who shot the suspect three times in the face when he repeatedly tried to reach for a gun, according to police reports. Two years before that shooting, Hall participated in the hunt for three men who had allegedly fired on police officers during a chase. After finding one of the suspects hiding in a carport in South-Central Los Angeles, Hall and another officer killed him after the suspect allegedly reached for a gun. Wednesday's shooting was Mooring's fourth since 1985, records show. In September, 1985, he and another K-9 officer confronted a suspected auto thief who was hiding under a pickup truck in Van Nuys. After the suspect announced, "I ain't going back" and "rapidly moved his left arm" as if to arm himself, Mooring and the other officer wounded him in the shoulder, hips and legs. In April, 1987, Mooring and his dog attempted to flush a prison escapee from the crawl space of a house on Mt. Washington. According to reports, when the escapee appeared to reach for a revolver, Mooring fired three rounds at the escapee and two other officers fired a total of four shots, killing the escapee.
19890331000000000	BRITISH ADMIT THEY FORGOT EXPLOSIVE ON JET. A new furor over airport security broke out Thursday after the discovery that a British Airways jet flew with an explosive aboard for at least two weeks because police on a bomb-detection exercise for dogs forgot to remove it. The gelignite was tucked in a seat pocket in economy class of the Boeing 747, news reports said. Authorities would not say when the gelignite was put on the plane. The incident was particularly embarrassing to British officials trying to tighten security after the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Air Transport Users Committee, a consumer group, called it "the sort of carelessness we can't afford." Lawmaker David Wilshire of the governing Conservative Party said the public is always being told that British Airways is among the most security-minded airlines. "My mind boggles at the thought of what airlines in Timbuktu are like if this is the best," he said. "The worst must be mind-blowingly incompetent." The chairman of British Airways, Lord King, said the explosives worked their way through the upholstery and that a cleaner found them Monday after the jet returned to Heathrow Airport from Toronto. Police Inspector Andrew Nielson said the gelignite weighed less than a pound and was four inches long and less than an inch wide. He said the substance had no detonator, could not explode by itself and "at the very worst it could flare up if ignited by fire." King said that even if the substance posed no danger, "that's not the point. It might have been something that was dangerous." He promised an investigation, adding, "If heads fall, they fall." The explosives were brought aboard the plane to test security but were overlooked by police dogs trained to search for bombs, authorities said.
19890409000000000	IMPORTED PRODUCE -- PESTICIDES ARE THE MAJOR CULPRIT. The border inspector made his way quickly through the stacked boxes, picking up a bunch of bananas, a carton of strawberries, a cucumber, a green bell pepper. Awaiting his attentions were crates of plantains, radishes, turnips, cilantro, asparagus, mustard greens and lettuce, all unloaded onto the cargo bays from waiting vehicles. "Beautiful," the inspector said, working his way rapidly through the crates, on the lookout for signs of pests, disease or other abnormalities. "Muy bonito." So it goes each day at the Otay Mesa Cargo Processing Facility, the entry point for Mexican goods arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. The bustling activity along the border is a part of the huge traffic of Mexican produce that moves north every day. While the sabotage of grapes recently focused attention on imports of Chilean products, it is Mexican fruit and vegetables that represent a much greater, and growing, chunk of the U.S. food consumption market. In fact, Mexico is by far the largest foreign supplier of fresh produce to the United States, sending north more than $600 million worth, mostly vegetables, last fiscal year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Chile, which ranked a distant second, exported somewhat less than $300 million worth of produce, mostly fruit, to the United States during the same period.  Constant Concern While sabotage, such as occurred with Chilean grapes, is a constant concern, activists worry about a more common problem: pesticides. In Mexico, as in the United States and other agricultural nations, pesticides are used extensively to destroy or control weeds, insects, fungi and other pests. Their application is credited with great gains in farm production. But many pesticides remain on fruits and vegetables and are ultimately ingested along with the food. Some have been shown to cause cancer or birth defects. With pesticide applications subject to less monitoring in Mexico and many other nations than in the United States, congressional investigators and others have raised questions about inspection of Mexican and other foreign produce as it arrives at U.S. ports of entry. "We have a completely inadequate monitoring system at the border," said Jay Feldman, national coordinator for the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, a Washington-based consumer group. Federal regulators insist that the pesticide residues in both imported and domestically produced foods are small. "We've monitored this for years, and we've found that the intake of pesticide residue is well below the acceptable daily intake," said Emil Corwin, a spokesman in Washington for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Of all imported foodstuffs sampled in 1987, the FDA says that 5.3% violated U.S. pesticide standards. However, that percentage is more than double the 2.6% of domestic food samples that were found to be in violation, according to FDA figures. (Ironically, Feldman notes that some pesticides banned in the United States but produced by U.S. manufacturers for foreign sales wind up back in the U.S. food chain through the food-import market.) With truckload after truckload of produce arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border daily -- about 1.5 million metric tons annually, more than 3 billion pounds -- finding pesticides on a given head of lettuce can be a daunting task.  1986 Study A 1986 congressional study found that the FDA samples less than 1% of imported food shipments; that the agency was capable of detecting less than half of the estimated 600 pesticides available on the world market, and that many pesticide-tainted foods were ultimately sold to U.S. consumers because of delays in pulling the produce off the market. FDA officials say they have worked hard to rectify some of the shortcomings identified by the inquiry, bolstering staff and improving inspection and lab techniques, among other things. "You can't absolutely guarantee safety in any case, said Gordon Scott, consumer affairs officer in the FDA's Los Angeles regional office, which covers Southern California and Arizona. "You try to do a statistical round of sampling." Despite such concerns, the growing produce trade is a much-needed source of foreign revenue for debt-wracked Mexico -- one that has been encouraged by Mexico City, with considerable success. The trend is upward. Vast irrigated production areas, such as the San Quintin region south of Ensenada in Baja California, have been carved out of parched desert and semi-desert largely to serve the U.S. market. Other key producing regions for the U.S. trade include the northern states of Sonora, Tamaulipas and Sinaloa. Modern highways lead directly from the farms and packing sheds to the border.  U.S. Investors Spurring the industry is the investment of many U.S.-based growers and international agribusiness concerns, drawn to Mexico by its proximity to the U.S. market, its cheap land, abundant sunshine, inexpensive labor and relative lack of regulations. Harsh working conditions and low pay for field hands, many of them Indians from the Mexican interior, have led to sporadic work stoppages and labor confrontations, but Mexican labor activists say their reform efforts have been stymied by the government's alliance with big growers. Most Mexican foodstuffs arrive via refrigerated trailer trucks at a dozen or so entry points along the 1,952-mile border, from Brownsville, Tex., on the Gulf Coast to San Diego on the Pacific. The bulk of the Mexican produce consists of winter vegetables destined for the supermarkets and grocery stores of the West. Tomatoes are king among the Mexican produce, accounting for more than 25% of total fruit and vegetable imports, followed by cucumbers, onions and peppers; more than 50 varieties of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs arrive from Mexico. Shipments of Mexican strawberries passing through Otay Mesa have grown from zero in 1983 to 26 million pounds last year. Because of pests that could be harmful to U.S. fruit crops, notably the Mexican and Mediterranean fruit flies, many Mexican fruits, such as citrus products, generally cannot be legally exported across the border unless accompanied by special certificates from U.S.-employed inspectors in Mexico attesting that the produce is pest free. Authorities concede that only a small percentage of produce and other goods can actually be looked at; they rely on sample spot checks. At the border, agricultural inspectors look for disease-bearing crops as FDA officials seek excessive pesticide residues. U.S. Customs Service personnel, sometimes employing drug-sniffing dogs amid the produce crates, attempt to ensure that duties are paid and no contraband is hidden amid the shipments.
19900414000000000	POLICE DOG STOPS SUSPECT IN CAR THEFT. A 27-year-old El Cajon transient was arrested Friday in Lakeside after leading police on a chase that ended shortly after he rammed a Sheriff's Department canine unit car, officers said. The chase started Friday evening in El Cajon when police saw Christopher Rossmiller in a car that had been reported stolen. Officers radioed for assistance from the Sheriff's Department, said Sgt. Roy Stamper of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. Police pursued Rossmiller through Lakeside, traveling north on Highway 67 until they reached a dirt lot by East Pino Road. The car driven by Rossmiller stalled. When he restarted it, he rammed the car carrying the police dog Sarge and continued out toward Lake Jennings. The damaged Sheriff's Department car remained in the chase. When Rossmiller reached Flynn Springs Road off Interstate 8, he jumped from his car and began running through a mobile-home park. The German shepherd leaped after Rossmiller and stopped him by fastening onto his groin, Stamper said.
19900509000000000	DIANNE KLEIN: COLD NOSE, WARM HEART JUST AREN'T ENOUGH FOR BERKELEY. You think of a police dog and what comes to mind? Big, snarly. Lots of attitude and teeth. Mean. Now think of Berkeley, the place that took the '60s seriously. Some people still call it Berserkeley. It's right next to Oakland, but worlds apart. Next try to think about Berkeley and a police dog together. Sort of like Rambo on a macrobiotic diet. I know, it's tough. But bear with me. This is part of a serious problem in the annals of New Age governance. Who knows? It may be what Irvine will have to contend with next. The Berkeley of the '90s needed a police dog with a nose for dope, not to sniff out residents' personal marijuana stashes-which legally, are still off-limits to police -- but crack cocaine, the bane of the city's poor neighborhoods. No animal even remotely reminiscent of the attack dogs unleashed on the anti-war and civil rights demonstrators of the '60s and '70s would do. Surely one can understand why. Perhaps, mused members of the City Council, the perfect beagle could be found. The beagles, however, never did pan out. But let me tell you about Stride. Stride, an English cocker spaniel, black with a bib of white on his chest, is a certified dope dog. He's also from Orange County, an unfortunate political association that the Berkeley City Council said it was willing to overlook. The council was elated just to know that such a kinder, gentler dope dog exists. Stride made his appearance before the council late last year. He plopped right there on the chamber floor, awaiting his turn. Cameras clicked, lights flashed. Then Stride sniffed out the crack hidden behind the dais in the council chambers without a hitch. Boffo. The cops, it seemed, were high on him too. But there was something else about this dog, something so Berkeley-esque. The council members adored his style, his elan, his canine savior faire. Stride's eyes were brown, soulful, liquid. The stubby tail started thumping and the body shimmied in sync. "He was just perfect," Berkeley Mayor Loni Hancock gushed at the time. She said the city might hire him as early as that day. OK, fast forward to reality. This is after Berkeley officials have refused to return any of my calls about Stride. It's this Tuesday morning, at Cabrillo Park in the city of Orange. Fred Kjorlien and I are sitting in the cab of his pickup truck, the big kind, not one of those little Japanese wannabees. Fred is a big kind himself. Forty-eight years old, burly, full gray beard, hair slicked back, cool, steely blue eyes, usually a cigarette between his fingers. He's a straight talker, articulate. He's been Stride's trainer and owner since the dog was a pup. Fred's an independent type, divorced with two kids. Stride, who works free-lance for $125 an hour, is how Fred pays the rent. So Fred is telling me that it really doesn't matter, that he doesn't want to make too big a deal about it, even though nobody in Berkeley has ever given him a reason for rejecting Stride, the dog he loves. Stride, meanwhile, is in the back of the truck, in his cage. I met him a moment earlier, when he gave me lots of kisses. Soon he will demonstrate his dope-finding skills. Fred says "find it," and within minutes Stride discovers a rag stuffed next to the truck's gas tank that bears the scent of some illicit stuff. Stride seems unflappable, and when I take the rag from his mouth, he doesn't even growl. Fred says that's normal, that the dog loves everybody. Never known to hold a grudge. "He'd leave with you in a heartbeat, as long as he thought I wasn't looking," he says. But I remind Fred about what I had read in the Bay Area press. Berkeley's assistant city manager, Weldon Rucker, said Stride was rejected because he was too stuck on Fred. Berkeley went with Pepper, a local Labrador, even though he didn't have Stride's finesse. And Rucker was quoted as citing other reasons for the switch as well. Stride was going for $10,000, while Pepper was half of that. And ageism -- tsk, tsk -- was present, too. Stride turned 5 on Saturday, while Pepper's not even 2. "It's like buying a new car rather than a used car," Rucker opined to the San Francisco Chronicle. Fred says he has no idea where the deal really went wrong, although he brings up something else that cops think but hardly ever say out loud. Stride is not a macho dog. A drug-sniffing Labrador -- cops feel OK about that. But when's the last time you saw a narcotics team with a little dog in tow? It just doesn't fit with the show. And here's what a German trainer said about Stride in his 1987 certification report: "His temperament is a little sensitive with a hardness level of under-medium." What that means, in other words, is that Stride is a soft touch. He doesn't snarl or bite, and he's even trained not to bark. "What we are dealing with is ignorance," Fred says. "He is not a stereotypical dog. . . . I'll put him up against any dope dog in the world." So with all this, I ask Fred, why would you want to let Stride go? Well, Fred hems for a bit, he really didn't. Oh, sure, he says, if he could have made $10,000, he would have taken it and then started training another dog, maybe to sell. What Fred says he really wanted to do was make a point. English cocker spaniels, he says, make great dope dogs, too. Macho? Fred says. What's so great about that? Stride's a professional, with boundless enthusiasm for his work. He loves people and he's a great tool. And besides, Fred stresses, Stride is an English cocker spaniel, not the American kind. Those kind are worthless, he says, and sissies, too. Fred takes another drag on his cigarette and then he smiles. Stride's tongue is flopped out and he seems to be hanging on Fred's every word. A man and his dog. Out having a good time. Dianne Klein's column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

19890518000000000	MEXICO HUNTS 22 ESCAPEES. Police and federal agents, helped by tracker dogs, hunted Wednesday through Puebla state for 22 of 25 inmates who escaped from a prison here, authorities said. Three escapees were recaptured after a shoot-out Tuesday.
19890522000000000	BURGLARY SUSPECT COLLARED BY THREAT WITH TEETH IN IT. It was an odd time for a campuswide announcement over Orange Coast College's public address system, but it got a suspected car burglar's attention about 6 a.m. Sunday. "OK, Allen, we know where you are, and we're going to send the police dogs in after you unless you come out now," boomed the voice of Costa Mesa Police Officer Clay Epperson throughout the campus. The announcement was effective. Allen Wilcox, 21, of Costa Mesa showed his face to police officers before police dogs had a chance to show their teeth. Wilcox and a companion, Aaron Raffensberger, 21, of Huntington Beach, were arrested Sunday morning on suspicion of vehicular burglary, possession of burglary tools and possession of stolen property, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary Webster said.  Suspect Fled to College A police officer saw two men apparently burglarizing a car about 5:45 a.m. at an apartment complex at 2700 Peterson Place, near Orange Coast College, Webster said. Raffensberger was held at the car, but the other suspect fled to the college. Officers surrounded a section of the campus and were given permission to use the public address system, Webster said. Although they did not know Wilcox's exact whereabouts, they bluffed a bit when they ordered him either to come out of hiding or be found by the dogs. Wilcox immediately emerged from the agricultural area. "The police dogs are a big deterrent," Webster said. "No one wants to meet them on a first-name basis."
19890527000000000	PAN PACIFIC FIRE BLAMED ON ARSONIST. Until the arrival of Mattie, Los Angeles arson investigators working the ruins of the historic Pan Pacific Auditorium were stumped. The place is so huge they did not know where to put vapor-detection equipment that must be no more than four inches from a source. But a few minutes after the 4-year-old black Labrador from Meriden, Conn., began sniffing the floor on Friday, investigators confirmed the presence of numerous spots showing evidence of flammable, volatile liquid. Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said during a news conference at the Beverly Boulevard site a few hours later that the pattern the dog identified helped arson investigators confirm what they had suspected: Wednesday's fire at the 54-year-old Streamline Moderne arena was set deliberately. The chief said the finding is the first step in any attempt to solve the crime. A laboratory analysis using gas chromatography will take several days to identify the liquid used to start the fire, he said. And although officials now are convinced that the fire was the work of one or more arsonists, they have no identified suspects. Investigators continue to seek information about reports that several people were seen in the cavernous structure just before the fire started, the chief added. Meanwhile, despite statements from elected officials that a $14.6-million plan for commercial restoration of the huge indoor arena should be abandoned, developer Joseph Kornwasser said he is "ready, willing and able" to keep the project alive even though that now means massive reconstruction. The use of Mattie, who can detect the presence of 17 flammable liquids at levels far more faint than can electronic probes, was the first use on the West Coast of a dog specially trained to assist arson investigators, according to the fire chief. He said he had been skeptical about using such a dog but had been persuaded by her performance at Pan Pacific and now supports the request of arson investigators to get one of their own.  Ferraro to Seek Funding Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, who attended the news conference, said he intends to lobby the council Finance Committee for funding. Mattie's handler, Doug Lancelot, a Connecticut State Police trooper, said she is one of five specially trained dogs working with fire departments in the United States. He said that she has assisted in the investigation of more than 200 fires and that laboratory analyses have confirmed her scentings about 75% of the time. He said her nose, which can detect flammable vapors in concentrations measured in parts per billion, is about 1,000 times more sensitive than electronic probes that can pick up vapor concentrations only in parts per million. Her presence at the Los Angeles fire site was in large part a result of the efforts of arson investigator Tony La Palio, who read about Mattie in a California magazine for arson investigators and began lobbying his superiors to find out more. "It took me six months to convince my boss," he said, adding that her performance Friday was the clincher. "There is nothing like seeing," he said. The cost of bringing the dog here, estimated at $1,000, will be paid by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco. Wrangling over the building's future continued. "As far as we are concerned," developer Kornwasser said in an interview, "the project can still be rehabilitated. For us, the Pan Pacific was a real labor of love and it continues to be that. It is real sad that people don't view the Pan Pacific in its historical perspective." The county planned to restore the building, which was on the National Register of Historic Places, by installing an ice-skating rink, a rhythmic gymnastics facility, movie theaters, a food court, restaurants, a sporting goods shop, park offices and meeting rooms for community groups. Neighbors had opposed the project, saying the entertainment-oriented development would bring crime, traffic, late-night noises, graffiti and parking problems.  County Rent According to a preliminary agreement with the architectural and development team of Kornwasser & Friedman/Goldrich & Kest, the county was to get an estimated $3.8 million in rent in the first 10 years of the project; officials hoped the money would defray the cost of keeping up the state-owned park, which is administered by the county. Ferraro, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman said Thursday in the wake of the fire that the plans to develop the Pan Pacific site should be scaled down. Kornwasser criticized the two city councilmen for pronouncing the county-sponsored project dead and added that he intends to work with county and state officials to see if he can revive the project.
19900528000000000	ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; POLICE OFFICER HARCO HAS HAD HIS DAY. Police Officer Keith Chang had seen his partner's retirement coming for some time. The first sign came when Chang had to help his partner scale a fence by giving him a little push over the top. But when the 75-pound Harco, one of Brea's first police dogs, started waiting at fences so Chang could carry him over, he knew it was time to hang up Harco's leash. Earlier this month Harco was honored by the City Council and officially retired. With a bad back, infected ears and weakening legs, the 10-year-old Harco can no longer chase suspects. During his 5 1/2 years on the force, Harco, a German shepherd, was responsible for finding $2 million in drug money, 80 kilograms of cocaine and 2 kilograms of marijuana. The city also credits Harco with searching 239 buildings and being instrumental in eight arrests. But more significant, Chang said, was the dog's impact as a deterrent. "I can't count the number of times an incident has been avoided purely because of his presence," Chang said. "We've had a number of suspects give up when we told them we were sending in Harco." Harco's teeth proved to be powerful persuaders, but it is the dog's nose that Chang admires the most. "He would never cease looking until he found what he was tracking," Chang said. "His ability to track was incredible." It took Chang, an officer for 20 years, some time before he would rely on that ability -- and Harco's other training -- when making decisions in the field. In one case, Harco indicated to Chang that suspects and stolen property were outside the area Chang and other officers had decided to search. Chang ignored the dog, but after giving up the search he let Harco satisfy his curiosity. The suspects and the stolen property were quickly discovered. "I was used to working the streets alone, and it was difficult to rely on a dog, who you can't reason with," Chang said. "But I got better at it as the years went by." Harco was teamed with Chang five years ago as one of Brea's first two canine units. Imported from Germany, the dog was 4 1/2 years old and had undergone obedience, protection and tracking training since he was a puppy. Upon his arrival in Brea, Harco underwent 160 hours of training with Chang in Riverside. To build and strengthen the bond between the team, Harco moved in with Chang, where he will continue to live. Like many retirees before him, Harco has not had an easy time adjusting to long days of leisure. To make matters worse, Harco has had to watch Chang and his new partner, Kit, leave for work each day. "When he hears the (police car) start up, he wants to come with me. He's a little jealous of his replacement," Chang said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE
19890531000000000	TRANSIENT ARRESTED IN FIRE AT PAN PACIFIC. A 42-year-old transient has been arrested as a suspect in connection with an arson fire that destroyed Los Angeles' historic Pan Pacific Auditorium a week ago, investigators announced Tuesday. At a news conference, Fire Chief Donald Manning said the suspect, identified as Mark Kamansky, was arrested Sunday afternoon in a park next to the charred ruins of the auditorium after he told investigators that he had entered the shuttered building on several occasions and had set "more than one fire" inside. Although authorities did not say that they were actively seeking further suspects, Battalion Chief Henry Ed Allen acknowledged that "we're looking for acquaintances."  Motive Is Unclear "He did confess that he'd set more than one fire in the structure," Manning said. "He did not give us a motive and we have not developed one for him yet." Manning, who said that the suspect "lived in an automobile," emphasized that "we have quite a bit of work ahead of us before we can actually file on this case." Los Angeles County Parks Police Capt. Manuel Cisneros said Kamansky -- who told officers that he was living in Pan Pacific Park -- was detained Sunday by a parks officer until arson investigators arrived. Under law, investigators have 48 hours to file charges against Kamansky, who is being held in lieu of $10,000 bail. If charges are not filed within that period, he would have to be released, Manning said. "The suspect is due out at 4 p.m. (today)," said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Savitt. "That means they have until then to put together all their information, present it to me, and I will make a decision one way or the other." But in a brief statement at the news conference, an optimistic Mayor Tom Bradley said that authorities had made "a good arrest and we're looking forward to completion of the investigation." Fire investigators said they are not concerned that the circumstances of the arrest are similar to an embarrassing arrest made in the wake of the 1986 fire that destroyed the Los Angeles Central Library.  Exaggerated Confession In that case, a 28-year-old Hollywood man was arrested after making statements to acquaintances and investigators that amounted to a confession. After his arrest, the suspect insisted his remarks had been exaggerations, and his attorney insisted that the man was the type of person who liked to "color events." After several days, the district attorney's office decided not to file charges. In the days after the Pan Pacific fire, arson investigators had alerted county parks officers to be on the lookout for transients matching descriptions provided by witnesses at the fire scene. Cisneros said that Parks Officer Keith Slack was patrolling the north end of the park at 3:30 p.m. Sunday when a "patron told Slack that a male transient was in the playground area exposing himself." In a field interview with Slack, Kamansky -- who fit the description provided by witnesses -- said that he "lived in the park" and that "he was in the building when the fire started," Cisneros said. Slack called arson investigators, Cisneros added, "who told him to detain the suspect at the scene." When an arson team arrived a few minutes later, Kamansky told them that "a white male and female were inside the building with him and that the three of them started the fires," Cisneros said. Kamansky then was booked, Manning said.  Spectacular Blaze The fire broke out in the southwest corner of the vacant entertainment center shortly after 7 p.m. last Wednesday. Flames from the building at 7600 Beverly Blvd. shot 200 feet into air, creating a tremendous traffic jam. Investigators earlier ruled out as a suspect a man who appeared to have suffered slight burns and smoke inhalation from the fire and then disappeared into the crowd before he could receive treatment. Three days after the fire, Mattie, a specially trained Labrador retriever, sniffed out the presence of a flammable liquid on the floor of the building. Mattie's handler, a Connecticut State Police trooper, said she is one of five such dogs working with fire departments in the United States. Times staff writer Bob Baker contributed to this story.
19900611000000000	ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DOG, POLICE SEIZE 4 AS ROBBERY SUSPECTS. A police officer and his dog foiled a suspected robbery attempt at an Anaheim convenience store early Sunday and arrested four men, one of whom was bitten as he tried to flee. Officer Andre Jimenez was on patrol with a department police dog, Falco, when he saw several men standing in front of an open Circle K market at 1080 W. La Palma Ave. and a car he deemed suspicious parked alongside the store at about 2:10 a.m., Police Lt. John Cross said. Some of the men spotted the police car and began running toward their vehicle, he said. One suspect, Ignacio Comonfort Ventura, 21, of Anaheim, ran to the back of the store and was apprehended, Cross said. Falco was sent after a second suspect, Raul Avila Romero, 19, of Anaheim, who ran north across La Palma Avenue, Cross said. The dog caught up to Romero, bit him on the hip, knocked him to the ground and held him until officers could take him into custody. Romero was treated at Western Medical Center and then booked into the city jail facility. Two other suspects, Leonelo Sanchez, 22, who refused to give an address, and Enrique Valencis Valencia, 22, of Anaheim, tried to flee in the car at the side of the store, but they were caught by another officer a short distance away, Cross said. All of the suspects were booked in Anaheim Jail on suspicion of attempted robbery. A fifth, unidentified suspect escaped. Cross said no weapon was found and no valuables were believed taken from the store. He said it was the suspicious behavior of the men at the store's front and inside the parked car that caught the officer's attention and their flight that led him to believe that a robbery had been in progress. Apparently, no weapons were seen and nothing was taken from the store, Cross said. In all, the Anaheim Police Department's K-9 detail uses two German shepherds and two malinois for night and graveyard patrols, Cross said. The dogs, paired with an officer/handler, also help police conduct searches for suspects and evidence, he said. The dogs undergo training sessions with the handler/officer once a week.
19900612000000000	THE WORLD CUP; POLICE, WET WEATHER KEEP FANS IN CHECK AS IRISH TIE ENGLISH. Scrappy Ireland rallied for a second-half goal and tied favored England, 1-1, Monday night in its World Cup debut. Massive Italian security precautions, ranging from military helicopters to huge police dogs, shut out English soccer hooligans who came early, cheered quickly -- and went home wet. Short of attacking ideas, slow to find the open man, neither team was convincing in playing to the 1990 Cup's first draw. For most of the game, the weather -- a stiff wind off the sea, an awesome lightning display and a chilly second-half rain -- provided more spectacle than action by England's whites and Ireland's greens. With frequent passes going astray and the ball constantly floating in the air, the quality of play was a notch below what Italy, Brazil and West Germany have brought to the Cup, and particularly disappointing for England, one of the favorites. "We had it won -- and lost it," said England's Coach Bobby Robson. "We made a mistake." Attacker Gary Lineker of London's Tottenham Hotspurs put England ahead after eight minutes on what, after nine games, might have been the tournament's ugliest goal. Chris Waddle lifted a pass over the Irish center backs, goalkeeper Patrick Bonner committed but could not control the ball, and Lineker chased it into the back of the net in a tangle with two disconsolate Irish fullbacks. "A scrappy, awful goal," Irish Coach Jack Charlton said. Kevin Sheedy missed Ireland's best chance in the first half, from six yards out, but got the equalizer in the 72nd minute on a field by then slick with rain. Sheedy, who plays for Everton in the English League First Division, controlled a deflected pass after it was mishandled by defender Steve McMahon of Liverpool, who had entered as a substitute a few minutes before. Making the most of McMahon's miscue, Sheedy drilled it smartly into the extreme corner of the net with a thundering left foot that gave venerable English goalkeeper Peter Shilton no chance. Soon thereafter, Liverpool's McMahon got the game's only yellow card as the teams exchanged weak chances, and the pace slackened into a draw rhythm. Overall, Ireland had seven shots, and England five. Ireland's Charlton, a former English star, made no secret of his delight at the result, which gives his team a good second-round shot in its first World Cup appearance. "We got no less than we deserved," Charlton said in the soggy aftermath. Irish fans, excited, exuberant and orderly in cascades of green, white and orange, outdid the English in numbers, volume and good humor Monday in a Sardinia braced for trouble after weekend disorders stirred by young English fans. With a reported attendance of 35,238, there were nearly 5,000 empty seats in the bright and modern stadium that is Sardinia's joy. Everybody who got in to see the game first had to run the gamut of an Italian security crunch that was calculated to intimidate. It did. Helicopters, troopers from three different forces, dressed for riot -- or war -- and cavalry enough to have saved Custer scrutinized spectators at a series of checkpoints on their way to the stadium. Once inside, they were watched by a high-tech network of television cameras. At one point, while they were still winning, English supporters began marching through the aisles of one section, but were joined instantly by a stern file of large policemen. When the game ended, the happy Irish left first. Once they were well on their way, the English stands were allowed to empty into wet streets where cabs were scarce, but not cops. With one point each after Monday's draw, England and Ireland both still must play powerhouse Netherlands, and Egypt, the fourth team in Group F. And with one point in hand, a victory over weak Egypt would mean three points and enough for advancement for both England and Ireland, no matter what happens to them against the Netherlands. The Dutch, potential finalists, play their opener tonight against Egypt in Palermo. England plays the Netherlands here Saturday in a game that is most potentially troubling to Italian police, since a dangerous minority of Dutch fans are as violence prone as their English counterparts.
19890703000000000	SAVED FROM POUND, HE POUNDS POLICE BEAT. Just a few months back, he was on doggie death row, a scruffy mutt so hyper that animal control officers called him Spaz -- for spastic -- and couldn't give him away. Today, he's the desert's most famous pooch, a celebrity canine winning accolades that would make Spuds McKenzie howl with envy. Meet Popeye, the Palm Springs Drug Dog. Adopted by this resort city's Police Department, Popeye has evolved almost overnight from a sick stray into Palm Springs' first drug-sniffing hound. "It's amazing," said Officer Pat Beltz, Popeye's handler and trainer for the department's K-9 unit. "He was doomed. . . . He was days away from death. And now he's working for the City of Palm Springs." By all accounts, young Popeye, a black and white beagle-spaniel mix, is already earning his Alpo. Trained to aid police in their search for narcotics secreted in homes, luggage, mail or any other place, Popeye has detected cocaine in a package, marijuana under a mattress and drug-tainted money in a locked steel box. U.S. Customs agents frequently seek his help in airport searches, and his trained nose has been in demand by the California Highway Patrol as well. Palm Springs High School officials have also enlisted Popeye's help, deploying his talents on student lockers. His colleagues on the five-dog K-9 unit may be huskier, handsomer and boast more impressive bloodlines, but Popeye already has become an instant hit with the public. At demonstrations, where kids and other dog lovers traditionally cheer the big, burly specimens used to bite and tackle suspects, Popeye now captures the spotlight. "He steals the show," said Beltz, who boards Popeye in a custom-built, city-financed $1,000 doghouse in his back yard. "He's little and so funny looking that he just stands out in the crowd." He's been booked on radio talk shows -- he barks on command -- and, who knows, Oprah and Donahue could be next. Palm Springs may be teeming with celebrities, but this one had a decidedly rapid rise to glory. Found wandering the streets in February, the dog was friendly but "basically too hyper for anyone to adopt," recalled Palm Springs Animal Control Officer Ted Nickerson. "We nicknamed him Spaz because all he'd do in the kennel was bounce, up and down, up and down," Nickerson said. "His behavior scared everybody away." As conditions at the pound grew crowded, Nickerson realized Spaz would have to go. Then Beltz spotted him. "We'd been looking since last year for a dog we could train to sniff for drugs, and the animal control people had called me that day about two dogs they thought might be suitable," Beltz said.  Passed With Flying Colors Neither passed muster, but as Beltz was leaving, he saw Spaz "jumping up and down, real high." Figuring this dog might have the energy demanded by the work, Beltz ran him through a series of tests that involve fetching wood, metal, plastic and rubber toys under varying circumstances. "He passed with flying colors. I took him home," Beltz said. He also renamed him Popeye, after Popeye Doyle, the tough, drug-busting cop character played by Gene Hackman in the film, "The French Connection." Training began in earnest, and soon he had his debut, alerting officers to a steel box of drug-contaminated money found at a parole violator's home. At just 28 pounds, Popeye is much smaller than his brothers on the K-9 corps, some of whom are three times his bulk. He lacks the fine breeding of his imported peers -- German shepherds Basko and Kiwi and Belgian malinois Dago and Dingo -- and he came much cheaper: free, versus the roughly $3,000 apiece paid for the other dogs. But by all appearances, Popeye couldn't care less. At Beltz's home, Popeye did a dozen or so laps of the yard under a blazing desert sun, and then paused to perform a mock search of a truck with marijuana hidden in the front bumper. "Wo est gifte?" said Beltz, as the dog began his frantic hunt. The command -- "Where is the poison" -- was in German, the language used to address all city police dogs. Twenty-eight seconds later, Popeye had found it. Visibly pleased with himself, the little mongrel gave a bark and went bounding off across the grass, twirling and jumping, happy to be alive.
19900718000000000	SECURITY DROPS NET -- TOY GUNS, PARKED CARS ARE SUSPECT. When a policeman recently approached officials at Yorba Linda Preschool and Day Care about using it as a security base for Thursday's dedication of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace, he looked around with concern at the playing children. "He said that if we had any toy guns we'd better put them away," recalled Carol John, an assistant director at the school. From a real estate office next door, meanwhile, U.S. Secret Service agents began jotting down license numbers of vehicles lingering in the area a full two weeks before President Bush and former Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Ford were scheduled to appear at the dedication of the nation's ninth presidential library. With the big day drawing ever nearer, a security net the likes of which Yorba Linda has never seen is descending rapidly over the sleepy bedroom community of 50,000 residents. Teams of Secret Service agents -- one for each President -- are being deployed to provide protection. Bomb-sniffing dogs and walk-through metal detectors are being readied for use at the site. More than 150 Orange County police officers are rehearsing for their role in ringing the library and surrounding streets. Even helicopter gunships are being made available -- just in case. Although no one is expecting trouble -- the vast majority of the estimated 20,000 people expected to turn out are predicted to be staunch Nixon loyalists -- Secret Service officials say they can never be too ready. "We go in wary at all times," said Hamilton (Ham) Brown, a retired Secret Service agent and executive secretary of the Former Agents' Assn. in Annandale, Va. "As a matter of fact, the more friendly the crowd the more vigilant we become because you expect the unexpected." Security preparations for the dedication have been jointly planned by the Secret Service and Brea Police Department, which provides police protection for Yorba Linda. According to Brea Police Lt. William Lentini, the two entities have been meeting constantly in recent weeks to work out such details as street closures and officer placements. For its part, Lentini said, the Brea Police Department will be heading a contingent of more than several hundred uniformed officers from Brea as well as the Orange County Sheriff's Department and nearly every department in the county, including Anaheim, Placentia, Fullerton, La Habra, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Westminster and Costa Mesa. All those officers, he added, would primarily be responsible for crowd and traffic control -- but would also be available to deal with any demonstrations that got out of control or handle other unforeseen problems. Lentini said he did not expect trouble, however. "It's a very 'pro' event," Lentini said, adding that he anticipates many families in attendance. Lentini said an area will be provided for demonstrators. "We recognize our obligation to provide an opportunity for those with different points of view to express their feelings and concerns," he said. The police will be using grounds at the preschool to store equipment and to give officers a place to rest. As is their custom, Secret Service agents were closemouthed about the specifics of their security preparations. Richard Adams, a Secret Service spokesman in Washington, emphasized, though, the importance his agency attaches in working with local law enforcement such as the Brea police. "We are on local law enforcement turf," Adams said. Adams said the groundwork for the library dedication was laid by the Los Angeles office of the Secret Service, while the intricate details of security would be handled by a Secret Service detail assigned to protect President Bush. Those agents, he said, generally arrive at a presidential venue a week ahead of time. Both Reagan and Ford have their own Secret Service details, which Adams said will be coordinated by the main presidential team. Nixon did away with his Secret Service protection in 1985 and has used private security since. Nixon personal assistant John Taylor said the former President would defer to the Secret Service in protecting him for his library visit. Taylor declined to discuss the security arrangements. Nixon is scheduled to arrive at Yorba Linda Middle School via helicopter and then be whisked to the library a few blocks away by police motorcade, said Roy Stephenson, Yorba Linda city engineer. The former President will be flying from the Century Plaza hotel in Los Angeles, arriving in Yorba Linda at about 7 a.m. Former Presidents Reagan and Ford will be arriving in bulletproof limousines. Bush will have spent the night in the Anaheim Hilton. If past experience is any indication, however, former agent Brown said Bush's helicopter would shuttle him to the library site. Before any Presidents arrive, the Federal Aviation Administration will have already sealed off the airspace around the library to all unauthorized traffic. FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said her agency routinely does this at the request of the Secret Service. The airspace restrictions usually are lifted after the dignitaries have left, she said. Although Secret Service officials would not comment about enforcement of airspace violations, Brown said local police agencies and even the Marines all have armed helicopters on standby to deal with any aerial encroachments. On the ground, Brown said, the Secret Service will conduct sweeps of the nine-acre library grounds with bomb-sniffing dogs and other bomb-detection apparatus. The uniformed branch of the Secret Service will also set up metal-detecting machines at entrances to the dedication site so all visitors can be screened for weapons, Brown said. The machines were put into use after Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme attempted to assassinate former President Ford in Sacramento in September, 1975, Brown said. He said that having the visitors checked gives a little more peace of mind to the Secret Service. If anything were to happen, Brown said the Secret Service would throw all of its protection around the Presidents. If it came down to it, Brown said Bush would receive the most security.
19890728000000000	HONORED 'OFFICER' TOOK A BITE OUT OF CRIME. Two dozen Inglewood police officers were jammed in the corner of Jino's Pizza shop honoring a legendary colleague who netted more than 1,000 arrests during a 6 1/2-year career. The guest of honor, meanwhile, was sitting politely on the floor, begging for a piece of pizza crust. Welz, a 9 1/2-year-old German shepherd whose career officially came to an end this month, received the same send-off career officers typically get -- a gathering of old friends, a few war stories and a commendation or two. "Whenever anyone retires, they should be recognized," said Detective Joe Suarez of the Los Angeles Police Department's Gang Enforcement Team, who was on hand Wednesday night to present the dog with a plaque for tracking down a multiple-homicide suspect May 16. Welz sniffed out the armed suspect, who had eluded Los Angeles police officers by hiding under a parked car in Inglewood. After taking a rap over the head, the dog subdued the suspect until officers arrived. It turned out to be his last arrest. "It was just another day at the office for him," said Welz's handler, Sgt. John W. Bell. "He's been beaten, kicked and shot at. He's found criminals in the most unlikely places -- on (roofs), in trees, in cars, where it would take an army of officers to find someone, he does it." Welz, who was born in Germany in 1980, proved his excellence in numerous statewide competitions. He became the first canine with the Inglewood Police Department to win a gold medal in the statewide Police Olympics and a silver medal in the World Games, an international competition. While on duty, the dog was known for his fearlessness, his tracking skills and his ability to discern the good guys from the bad. "Welz was the dog that set the standard for the other handlers throughout Southern California," said Tony Bairos, a Bakersfield kennel operator who has imported German police dogs for departments across the nation. "Welz was the envy of many, many handlers."  A Gentle Side And while Welz (pronounced Velz) was recognized in law enforcement circles as the ultimate street dog, his owner is proud of the other side of his character -- his gentleness and "his uncanny ability to make people at ease." When not sprinting down city streets after gang members, Welz would spend time in senior citizen homes, hospitals and schools allowing just about anybody to pat him on the head. "The school kids would say, 'He only bites bad people so I must be good,' " Bell said. The dog began his career with Bell in 1983 at the age of 2 1/2. He is now 9 1/2, a few months past the usual retirement age for a police dog, and a senior citizen in human terms. Although Welz is still a very good police dog, Bell said, he was beginning to slow down and show some signs of age. Like many who retire, it has taken time for Welz to adjust to the far less strenuous life style. When Bell first began leaving the house in the morning alone, he said, Welz seemed disappointed and would whine and cry by the front door. But Welz is becoming more mellow, Bell says. He has added a few pounds and is beginning to acknowledge his new role as a house pet. And now it's Bell, a 16-year veteran with the Inglewood police who was recently promoted from an officer in the K-9 Corps to a sergeant in the patrol division, who has the adjusting to do. Bell and his four-legged partner were virtually inseparable over the last six years. They worked together all day, worked out together on the beach on weekends, and on Sunday Welz would sit patiently in the back of the church. "He's been a real steady portion of my life," Bell said. "I've told a lot of things to him I wouldn't tell another human being. . . . Who knows? Maybe I'll try to sneak him into the office."
19900813000000000	CANINES TAKE A BITE OUT OF JAIL WORKLOAD. San Diego County jails have a common and troubling problem: too many inmates, too few jailers. During a typical shift at the Descanso honor farm, about 10 sheriff's deputies watch more than 400 inmates. At the Las Colinas Jail in Santee, about 30 deputies and corrections officers oversee more than 1,000 male and female inmates. To help even the odds, the Sheriff's Department has put some furry, four-legged friends on the job. The specially trained German shepherds last month began making rounds with deputies at the Las Colinas and Descanso jails. Most of the county's potentially dangerous inmates are sent to other facilities, and the dogs are stationed in Descanso and Santee partly for crowd control, said Mel Nichols, the county's commander of jail operations. "When it's 1 to 75 or so, every little bit helps," he said. Nichols hopes the animals will also excel at another part of their job description: hunting down escaped inmates in the rural areas around the two jails. During the first six months of this year, there were three escapes and two attempted escapes at Las Colinas, Nichols said. Although no one escaped from Descanso during the first half of this year, one inmate tried to escape the first day the dogs were on duty in July, Nichols said. Officials did not have an opportunity to test the dogs' tracking ability, however, since the inmate was apprehended before he made it over the fence. "We haven't really had an opportunity to put the dogs to use," said Ray Root, an administrative supervisor at Descanso. "We don't know what the effect will be." No other county in California uses dogs to assist jailers, but San Diego's experiment with the animals might lead others to try them as well, Nichols said. "A lot of people, particularly in Southern California, are watching this to see how it works out," he said. Neil Zinn, a field representative for the State Board of Corrections, agreed. "We want to see whether or not it can make a difference," Zinn said. "San Diego County is plagued with chronic overcrowding and understaffing. . . . It could be that San Diego County is looking for a psychological edge over its inmates." Sheriff's officials think they have that edge with the dogs. Christine Mills, one of the dog handlers at Las Colinas, said inmates have given her a wide berth since she started patrolling with Argo, a 70-pound shepherd who stands about 5 feet tall on his hind legs. "When they see the dog, the movement stops," Mills said. "They're very leery of the dog. And they're very good about getting out of the way." That's just the effect deputies were hoping for. They are also hoping that the dogs will provide peace of mind for nearby residents, particularly at Las Colinas. Some Santee residents protested vehemently before and after the men's section of Las Colinas opened last year. "The citizens of Santee had a concern about another jail going into their neighborhood," said Clay Reynard, program director at Las Colinas. "We hope the dogs will be a large deterrent." But a spokesman for the city said the new sentries probably won't be enough to completely quell community concerns. "There were several issues," said Bill Adams, the city's public information officer. "One of the main issues was public safety, and anything that can enhance public safety would be welcomed." For now, only three dogs are working at each facility, Nichols said. The dogs cost about $3,500 each; the total budget for this year's program is about $39,000, he said. Funding for the program came from money seized in drug raids. "We've been trying to get this in effect for the past four years," Nichols said. "We didn't really have the money in the normal budget process." He was reluctant to discuss expanding the use of dogs. "Next fiscal year -- we'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Nichols said.
19890827000000000	BILL, SOUTH GATE'S MELLOW POLICE DOG, RETIRES AFTER 5 YEARS OF HOT PURSUITS. When he joined the South Gate Police Department five years ago, there was some doubt that Bill, the German shepherd, was suited for police work. After all, there were a few occasions when he showed no aggression, simply walking away from suspects. And there was the time the 85-pound dog was chased by a goose. "Some of the administrators wanted to get rid of him," said Police Officer Frank LaVigne, the dog's handler. But that is all behind Bill now.  Years of Chases After extra hours of training by LaVigne, the dog proved his worth during more than five years of chasing criminals. In more than 100 searches for suspects, Bill was successful in 65 of them, police officials said. So earlier this month, when the 9-year-old dog retired, he got his retirement party, just like all other Police Department retirees. Top police officials, including Police Chief Ron George, and LaVigne were there to help celebrate. The dog, who is suffering from arthritic-type problems in his joints, received his share of presents. There was a 12-by-18-inch white cake. Bill had several pieces. And he was given a city fire hydrant. Bill rarely passed a hydrant he did not make use of during his career, LaVigne said. However, he did manage to resist the bright yellow fire hydrant during retirement ceremonies Thursday at the South Gate Auditorium. Reflecting on the five years he and Bill spent together on the streets, LaVigne said, "Bill was mellow until he needed to be aggressive." Bill was smart and tough, LaVigne said. LaVigne remembered the time, about three years ago, when Bill found a car-theft suspect after other officers had given up the search. Bill kept barking and scratching at a garage that police had locked after searching it, LaVigne said. The garage was searched again and the suspect was found hiding in a cabinet, LaVigne said. The suspect had somehow sneaked inside after the police made their initial search, LaVigne said. LaVigne also recalled the time, despite a cut paw, when Bill was able to hold onto a man trying to flee after beating up a woman. The man had cut Bill's paw with a large iron chain. Bill needed stitches to close the wound. "He was exceptional. He knew when to switch it on and when to switch it off," Sgt. Ralph Carter said. During his retirement party, Bill showed his friendly side by playing with the three small LaVigne children. Later, he demonstrated his aggressiveness when LaVigne commanded him to tackle a police officer who was pretending to be a fleeing criminal. Bill will spend his retirement years with the LaVigne family at their Moreno Valley home in Riverside County.  Bought in Riverside All of the dogs that serve in the department's K-9 program are bought from the Adlerhorst Police Dog Handler's School in Riverside. The dogs and their handlers receive training at the kennel, which provides dogs for many police departments, according to Pip Reaver. Reaver and her husband, David, own and manage the dog school. The dogs, which are imported from Germany and Holland, are taught to use their noses in finding suspects, she said. Lt. Russell Beecher, who is in charge of the South Gate police K-9 program, said the dogs are also taught only to attack a fleeing suspect or one that is threatening the officer or the animal. The City Council recently budgeted $7,300 to pay for training Officer Ron Inman and Waldo, the dog who will replace Bill. Waldo joins two other dogs in the South Gate K-9 program, Cliff and Boris.
19900901000000000	CYPRESS POLICE REGRETFULLY 'FIRE' CANINE OFFICER. Saying that he was "just a little soft for police work," officials have reluctantly booted Sam the police dog from the force. When Sam joined the Cypress Police Department three years ago, he showed great promise. He seemed like a natural, scoring well above average on his performance tests and easily making friends with fellow officers. But it became apparent to his superiors that Sam didn't have enough bite behind his bark. In fact, he was too friendly. So this month, the 6-year-old Belgian Malinois was fired after less than three years on the job. "We didn't feel good about giving Sam up," said Lt. Jim Weuve, coordinator of the department's canine program. "But he did not consistently perform to the standard that we require." Citing the confidentiality of personnel files, police officials declined to provide details concerning Sam's early retirement. However, a staff report to the City Council said Sam was not able to translate what he learned in canine training to street situations. "It's tough," said Officer Danny Forniss, Sam's handler and former partner. "It is hard to turn your back on someone who has been loyal." But one thing he did do on a regular basis was win the hearts of people in the community. "He was great when he had to go to (elementary) schools. He was definitively a people dog," Forniss said. "Maybe just a little soft for police work." The City Council this week agreed to purchase another dog to replace Sam. Forniss is now training with his new partner, Brutus, who, like Sam, is a Belgian Malinois. The cost of training the dog and officer is more than $4,000. However, a trade-in allowance of $2,000 was given for Sam. Forniss said they are going to do everything possible to make sure that the new dog is better suited for police work. The Police Department has had three dogs since starting its canine unit, and the average length of duty is five to seven years, he said. As for Sam, he was returned to the kennel and quickly purchased by another police officer. Forniss said he would have liked to kept Sam, but was unable to because it might create competition between him and his new partner.
19900927000000000	CLAIM FILED OVER POLICE DOG'S BITE; OXNARD: THE $100,000 LEGAL ACTION IS THE THIRD ONE AGAINST THE CITY'S K-9 UNIT IN THREE YEARS. POLICE SAY THE ANIMALS HELP FIND DRUGS AND LOST CHILDREN.. An incident involving an Oxnard police dog that allegedly escaped from a patrol car and bit both a police officer and a crime suspect has led to the filing of a $100,000 damage claim against the city -- the third legal battle in as many years involving the K-9 unit. In the latest of three incidents involving Oxnard police dogs since 1987, Aaron Person, 21, of Oxnard is seeking $100,000 for physical and emotional damage in connection with an alleged dog attack on March 23. Person's claim against the city, filed Monday by a Van Nuys attorney, charges that he was unnecessarily injured when a police dog escaped from a patrol car and attacked him as well as a police officer who had wrestled him to the ground in an alley near Citrus Grove Lane. During the attack, according to a police report, the dog bit Officer Scott Hebert in the face before biting Person on the right leg. Both men were hospitalized for several days, authorities said. Despite the attacks, Oxnard police officials defend the K-9 unit. "We are happy with our K-9 unit," said Assistant Police Chief William Cady, adding that the four dogs in the department help find lost children and locate hidden narcotics and suspects. However, he acknowledged that the dogs are not perfect. "They are dogs and they do things on instinct even though you train them the best you can," he said. "They do bite people sometimes," said Lt. Stan Myers, who oversees the K-9 unit. "It's unfortunate but they do." But, he said, "The dogs do an outstanding job." Person's claim, a legal move required before a lawsuit can be filed against a city, follows two other incidents in Oxnard that have led to lawsuits -- one of them resolved by an out-of-court settlement. Last year, the city settled a lawsuit filed by Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Kenneth Bailey, who charged that he was bitten on the leg by a police dog named Kai while on duty and in pursuit of a burglary suspect. The attack occurred in the 1900 block of San Gorgonio Avenue on Aug. 6, 1988, according to the claim -- and later a lawsuit -- filed against the city. James Farley, the attorney who represented Bailey, said the dog was released by his handler while Bailey was chasing a burglary suspect. The dog bit Bailey because he could not distinguish between the burglar and the deputy, Farley said. Farley said he does not recall exactly how much the city paid Bailey. But he estimated that it was more than $3,000. The city still faces a $100,000 lawsuit in a 1987 incident in which Epifiano Cervantes and his brother, Artemio Cervantes, allegedly were bitten by Kai when the dog was sent into a house that police believed was being burglarized. Oxnard police acknowledged in a police report that they later realized they had investigated the wrong house. In the most recent incident, Officer Hebert was hospitalized for several days and still has visible scars, police said. Hebert declined to comment Wednesday. Person, who was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest, was hospitalized with a large bite wound on his inner thigh. Person later pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and three years of probation, court officials said. Andy J. Collins, a Van Nuys attorney representing Person, claimed the Police Department was negligent in handling the dog. "The dog went crazy, and I don't think it was meant to happen that way," he said. "The dog came out of nowhere and started biting." The March 23 incident began when Hebert was on routine patrol near the Carriage Theater on Gonzales Street, according to a police report written by Officer Kenneth Klopman. The report says Hebert saw Person leaving the theater and recognized him as being on probation stemming from a conviction for being under the influence of drugs. According to the report, Hebert called out to Person, but Person fled through the parking lot. Hebert chased Person on foot and caught him in an alley near a condominium complex on Citrus Grove Lane near C Street, the report said. The report said Hebert tried to search and handcuff Person but Person resisted. A struggle ensued and both men fell to the ground, the report said. "Hebert got on top of Person, who was face down on the ground," the report said. "Hebert attempted to apply a carotid chokehold on him." At that time, Officer James O'Brien of the K-9 unit drove up to the alley and, witnessing the struggle, got out of his patrol car to help restrain Person, the report said. While the report does not say how the dog got out of the patrol car, it relates that the three men were struggling on the ground when the dog bit Hebert on the face. "Hebert rolled off Person and heard him yelling and O'Brien telling Person to 'Let go of the dog,' " the report said. "Hebert then realized that he had been bitten . . ." Collins said that under the requirements of Person's probation, police are allowed to search him for drugs. Collins said he doesn't dispute the fact that Person ran from the officer, but he contended that Person was the victim of police negligence in handling the dog. "It's all rather vague on how he got out," Collins said, referring to the dog. "But I don't think the dog was meant to get out." The attorney said he is not sure whether Person's injury has healed completely.
19891001000000000	UNIQUE TECHNIQUE IN NETHERLANDS; SERGEANT SNIFFS OUT WAY TO ID SUSPECTS. Police Sgt. Jan de Bruin proudly displays his collection of glass jars, each containing the scent of a robber, a rapist or a killer. The scents, extracted from objects on the scene of a crime or from human subjects, could help Rotterdam's police dogs sniff out some of the city's most dangerous criminals. In his new "smell bank," the first of its kind in the West, De Bruin already has about 40 samples that he can preserve for at least three years. He plans to build the collection to about 300 samples, providing Rotterdam police with a unique addition to their criminal files. "Everybody has a different smell that a dog can recognize," said De Bruin, 48, who has devoted the last 12 years to perfecting the science of collecting and storing human odors. He is technical director of Rotterdam's police dog unit. Scientists are impressed by De Bruin's work, which they say could provide vital clues for criminal investigations. Other Dutch police forces are envious of Rotterdam's $700,000 smell bank, while canine experts in other European countries and the United States are intrigued by his methods. When a serious crime, such as a murder or bank robbery, occurs in Rotterdam, De Bruin is called to the scene with his homemade scent-extraction kit. He wraps any article bearing traces of the criminal's personal odor in a sterilized cotton cloth and places it in a large plastic ventilation box, equipped with an electric fan. As air blows through the box, scent molecules from the object evaporate and are absorbed by the cotton. After 20 minutes, the cloth is transferred to an airtight storage jar, labeled with the date and place of the crime, and stored in a room especially reserved for De Bruin's collection. "This sample was taken from the glove of a bank robber," De Bruin told a reporter, pointing to one of the jars, the sort more commonly used for preserving fruit and vegetables. Another sample came from a cigarette lighter, carelessly dropped by a murderer as he fled. "The whole human body is a source of odors. We leave behind scent molecules wherever we go," De Bruin said, noting that he also gathered odor traces directly from human skin. When major crime suspects in Rotterdam are arrested, they are photographed and fingerprinted on arrival at a police station. But they also have to provide a scent sample by holding one of De Bruin's special cloths for five minutes. In his experiments, dogs have accurately identified people from a scent sample taken three years ago, but De Bruin believes the specimens could last much longer. "De Bruin's techniques are quite new and could be very helpful to police," said chemist Jan Schaefer, an odor specialist at the TNO private research institute in Zeist, who advised De Bruin on his research. Police have traditionally used trained dogs to help track down or identify criminals, using the scent of an object belonging to the culprit. Schaefer said, however, that only highly trained dogs can match a human odor to its owner, and even the most skilled animals make mistakes if improperly handled. He said the most commonly used police identification test, in which a dog selects a culprit from a line-up of suspects, is unreliable because humans under stress emit different body odors. It was such flaws that spurred De Bruin, who has worked with dogs for more than 30 years, to devise more scientific ways of putting his canine colleagues to work. Besides creating his smell bank, De Bruin introduced more sophisticated detection tests. Instead of a row of people, he presents the dog with a row of glass jars containing cloth odor samples, taken earlier from participants in the test.
19901006000000000	HUGE COCAINE SEIZURE AT BORDER CROSSING A RECORD; CRIME: A TWO-NATION MANHUNT FOR THE DRIVER OF THE TANKER TRUCK, WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED PRIOR TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE DRUGS, IS CONDUCTED.. Federal authorities, having completed the unloading of almost 4 tons of cocaine discovered this week in a propane tanker truck en route from Mexico, on Friday declared it the largest cocaine seizure ever along a U.S. land border crossing. The 7,702-pound haul -- with an estimated street value of $262.5 million -- is believed to be the second-largest ever seized in California. A mammoth cache of 21 tons (42,000 pounds) was discovered last year in the San Fernando Valley community of Sylmar. The Sylmar load had been smuggled into the United States from the El Paso, Tex., border area, a fact that experts say underscores the border's role as a conduit for illicit substances headed for the U.S. market. U.S. and Mexican officials were conducting a two-nation manhunt Friday for the truck driver, who was allowed to leave the Otay Mesa inspection station area when customs officials were unable to readily determine whether drugs were inside the suspicious truck. The driver, a Mexican whose name was not released, was detained for at least eight hours before he was allowed to go free Wednesday afternoon, Customs officials said. Despite the ongoing search of his vehicle, authorities said that there was no legal basis to detain the man any longer. "We can't hold someone indefinitely at the border," said Thomas W. Hardy, acting district director for the U.S. Customs Service in San Diego. "I can't say there was an error; we're looking into that." The search to discover the drugs dragged on for almost 1 1/2 days, authorities said. Inspectors first took apart the truck's 18 tires and later bled excess propane, which is highly volatile, from the tank. Investigators did not discover the cocaine until 2:30 p.m. Thursday -- about 24 hours after the driver had been permitted to leave and some 32 hours after the vehicle had initially pulled into the border entry. The drugs were finally all unloaded at 4 a.m. Friday. Inspectors first became suspicious, officials said, when narcotics-sniffing dogs stationed at the facility paid attention to the vehicle's tires, indicating that there might be drugs concealed in the wheels. After weighing, it was determined that the truck, which was supposedly empty, weighed more than it should. Authorities said there was no advance information that the vehicle might be ferrying contraband. The drugs were wrapped in 3,501 packages, or bricks, each weighing about 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds. Among the wrappings used, authorities said, was a newspaper from Medellin, Colombia, base of the legendary drug cartel. U.S. officials would not comment when asked about the likely destination of the cocaine. The substance was probably loaded onto the truck in Mexico, within five miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, said Ron D'Ulisse, spokesman in San Diego for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The bust, officials said, illustrates the wide use that international traffickers are making of the U.S.-Mexico land border, which stretches for almost 2,000 miles from Texas to California. Mexico has long been a major transshipment point for South American cocaine, as well as a primary source of heroin, marijuana and other illicit substances favored by U.S. users. Smugglers utilize both the vast unguarded spaces between border entries and attempt to sneak drugs in vehicles through the ports, hoping that understaffed inspection teams will not search their cargoes. Tens of thousands of cars and trucks enter the United States each day from Mexico, a fact that makes its impossible to search each vehicle. Tanker trucks frequently have been used to ferry marijuana and other illicit substances. "They (the traffickers) never stop being innovative," said Julius Beretta, special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego. "Something like this leads you to wonder how many times it has happened (before). We just don't know." Last year, 589,000 trucks -- more than 1,613 per day -- entered the United States at the Otay Mesa crossing, which is about 8 miles east of the larger, non-commercial port at San Ysidro. The white tanker truck ferrying the cocaine normally carries propane gas for Hidro Gas Juarez, a firm in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Executives of the firm could not be contacted Friday by The Times. U.S. authorities said that the firm was cooperating in the investigation. U.S.-produced propane is regularly shipped in such tanker trucks to Mexico, where it is widely used for cooking and heating. The company has had related problems before, a customs official said. In 1985, said Bobbie Cassidy, a customs spokeswoman in San Diego, inspectors discovered two separate loads of marijuana -- 80 pounds and 55 pounds -- in the tires of two Hidro Gas Juarez trucks. She could not say if any prosecutions resulted from those seizures. The most cocaine seized at a U.S. land border before this is believed to have been 3,589 pounds near El Paso in September, 1987, said John Miller, a customs spokesman in Los Angeles. The largest San Diego seizure before this was 1,920 pounds in 1988 from a truck at the Otay Mesa port, authorities said.
19891009000000000	E. GERMAN POLICE BEAT PROTESTERS; BRUTALITY IN BERLIN COMES ON 2ND DAY OF DEMONSTRATIONS. Security forces broke up a candle-lit protest march in East Berlin on Sunday as ordinary citizens here and in other cities deplored the brutal police suppression of peaceful demonstrations that called upon East Germany's hard-line regime to undertake political reforms. Despite chants by the marchers in East Berlin of "No violence! No violence!" police snatched some participants from the 1,500-strong march, beating them on the head with truncheons, witnesses said. It was the second day of widespread disturbances linked to the visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who took part in the weekend's 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the East German state.  Gorbachev a Hero Gorbachev has emerged as a hero to the East German people through his effort to democratize Soviet life, which has led to liberalization in other East Bloc countries. East Germans have been demanding similar reforms for their own country, but the regime led by 77-year-old Erich Honecker has refused to budge. The demonstrations compounded the embarrassment of the Honecker regime, already smarting over the flight of about 45,000 East Germans to the West in recent weeks. In the East Berlin protest, the demonstrators chanted "Freedom! Freedom!" after attending a service at the Lutheran Gethsemane Church, a center for the nation's budding reform movement. Police blocked the demonstrators as they marched along nearby Schoenhauser Allee on Sunday night and ordered them to disperse. The police demands were drowned out by chants of "We are the people! We are the people!" Residents in the area went to their balconies and windows displaying lighted candles in a show of solidarity with the demonstrators below. Many of the demonstrators obeyed the police order, but some did not. It was then that police waded into the throng, swinging their clubs. Similar attacks by police occurred here and in Dresden. The East Berlin demonstrators had gathered at the Gethsemane Church to pray for the 700 people church sources said had been rounded up by police during the weekend demonstrations. "Many more than usual have come because since yesterday (Sunday), something has happened in this country and many people say it just cannot continue like this," a pastor told the congregation. Citizens interviewed in East Berlin, Dresden and here in Leipzig vowed they will continue to call for reforms -- despite the police attacks. The events of the past few days presaged a calculated police crackdown on dissenters, observers said, no matter how peacefully the protests may have been conducted. An observer from West Berlin, who traveled through East Germany, put it this way Sunday: "These are protests from people who have been quiet for years and decided to say something in public -- because they couldn't take it any longer. "Ironically, the police are beating up the citizens who want to stay," the observer added, "not those who want to leave" their country for the West. Here in Leipzig, East Germany's second city, the scene outside the Protestant Nikolai Church on Sunday afternoon seemed to crystallize national resentment against the tactics of the police and local militia forces. Bouquets of flowers were placed under the stained-glass windows and lighted candles served as a vigil of remembrance around the Baroque old church, which has served as a focal point for peaceful protests here. Witnesses here said Sunday that as many as 20,000 marchers formed on Saturday, before the demonstrations were broken up by stick-wielding security forces accompanied by Alsatian dogs. Outside the church, waiting for it to open for 5 p.m. services, dozens of Leipzigers gathered, muttering and grumbling about the outcome of Saturday's demonstration. People here say that at least 2,000 police were involved and that dozens of people were injured and hundreds were apprehended by the police -- although most were later released. "People are scared to go out on the streets," said one man of about 30, showing a bandaged hand where he had been struck by a police club. During the march toward the central railroad station, people whistled the Communist anthem "Internationale," some people called out "Help us, Gorby," a reference to the Soviet president, and others simply chanted "New Forum," the name of a new organization that has gathered 10,000 signatures of support in just a few weeks after it circulated a manifesto calling for more dialogue between the government and the people of East Germany. And a young man who had watched the demonstration said he heard a senior police officer expressly order: "Use your knuppel," the German word for truncheon, and "Drive them out of the square." A heavy-set man, about 35, said that both his brother and brother-in-law were members of the militia. "I cried when I saw what they did last night. I am ashamed for my family." As the people spoke out to the reporters, one pointed to some windows on the side of the square and said: "Look! There are cameras there. The Stasi (secret security police) are filming us." A blonde woman said she was present with her 9-year-old child in the area of the demonstration. "They used tear gas and water cannons," she said, "and they were hitting women and children." And another insisted: "The hard part to accept is that all of us are peaceful. We are the ones who want to stay in the country. Yet they are beating us." An older man in the crowd said: "Lots of people are leaving the (Communist) party and the youth organizations because of the behavior of the government in cracking down on these peaceful gatherings." And someone else said that Communist Party members who play in the famous Leipzig Orchestra have left the party as a gesture of protest. One person said that the local cabaret in Leipzig has been banned. In Germany, even on the Communist side, the cabaret is the safety valve through which political comment can be expressed, satirically, in nightclubs. Monday evening has been a traditional time when the peaceful protesters have gathered at the Nikolai Church, and, after services, marched across a mall to the main railroad station. It was here three weeks ago that five people, members of New Forum, were arrested and sentenced to terms of four to six months in jail for anti-state activity. On Sunday in Dresden, the beautiful, Baroque city that was bombed into ruins during World War II and still carries the scars, a scientist who is the local coordinator for New Forum said that 10,000 to 15,000 people had marched from the main railroad station to the Town Hall and along various streets on Saturday. But he said that the pattern in other cities had been followed in Dresden: Police breaking up large formations of people, using clubs and splitting them into smaller groups, then driving them along side streets.  Different from Earlier Rioting Officials of the New Forum in Dresden took pains to explain that the weekend protests there were different from the rioting that occurred around the railroad station Tuesday and Wednesday. The earlier demonstrators had been trying to get aboard trains passing through Dresden, bound either for Prague or returning through Dresden with East German emigrants bound for the west. "Those others who caused the trouble wanted to get out," a Dresden woman said Sunday. "But we wanted to stay." The New Forum members said they were seeking to have the government "decriminalize" their organization "so we can operate openly," as one man put it. "Otherwise anything we say can be considered anti-government." HUNGARIAN DEBATE Party factions split over old-line Communists. Page 5.
19891016000000000	ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE; NEWPORT BEACH; 4 HONORED AS TOP '89 PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. Four Newport Beach public safety officers have been selected to receive employee-of-the-year awards, one of the highest honors their departments can bestow for outstanding public service. The Newport Beach Police Department has named Thomas Voth, 36, of Orange as Officer of the Year for 1989. Voth, a 12-year police veteran, is one of three officers on the force who work with police dogs. He and his partner, a 5-year-old German shepherd named Hondo, are credited with field work and searches that have resulted in several arrests. Department officials also praised Voth for his work with Neighborhood Watch organizations. "Voth was selected for consistent and outstanding teamwork," Sgt. Andy Gonis said. "He is always there when you need him, and he always does a good job." Named Firefighter of the Year was Richard D. Middlebrough, 42, of Laguna Niguel. Middlebrough, a 14-year veteran, is part of the department's videotape unit at its headquarters and president of the Newport Beach Firefighters Assn. "I just have fun doing my job, and that's about it," Middlebrough said. Lifeguard of the Year honors went to Mike Halphide, 24, of Yorba Linda, a recent graduate of UC Irvine. Halphide, who has been a seasonal lifeguard since 1984, is credited with hundreds of rescues. "He is an all-round great guy and has done every job that's been handed to him," Marine Safety Officer Mitchell White said. "He's one of the leaders down here." Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Brian Kleeman, 46, of Huntington Beach has been named Harbor Patrolman of the Year for his contributions to training exercises involving marine firefighting. Kleeman, a 17-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, was praised particularly for a joint exercise with the Newport Beach Fire Department to assess firefighting capabilities. Voth, Middlebrough, Halphide, and Kleeman were honored Saturday night at a dinner-dance hosted by the Newport Harbor American Legion. DAN WEIKEL
19891125000000000	DOG WITH DANDY NOSE FOR DRUGS; CRIME: GERMAN SHEPHERD IS A LEGEND AMONG NARCOTICS OFFICERS. HE'S SNIFFED OUT A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF THE STUFF.. Twenty-one tons of cocaine is nothing to sneeze at. So, before police stormed the Sylmar warehouse that in September yielded the biggest drug bust in history, they turned to the best nose in town. It just happened to be dark and moist and attached to the snout of Dandy Vom Sargau, a graying, 9-year-old German shepherd who works nights for the Monrovia Police Department. When the dog was asked to sniff a tattered cardboard box that had been discovered outside the warehouse, he exploded in a snarling fury that police said could only mean he had detected a trace of narcotics. "One of the officers knew that Monrovia had a great dog," said Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Ralph Lochridge. "His alert on that box was a part of the overall probable cause that led to the search warrant." While another well-trained hound probably could have also followed his nose to the same conclusion, those who know Dandy say that his experience and consistency have made him top dog in the drug-sniffing department. Virtually every San Gabriel Valley law enforcement agency -- even those with their own canine units -- have asked Dandy for help. He has also performed searches for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, California Highway Patrol, the Postal Service, Secret Service and FBI. "I don't think he's ever made a mistake," said Jake Jahelka of Canine K-9 Scents Inc., whose academy in Canyon Country has provided narcotics training for Dandy and about 50 other dogs in police departments across the western United States. "His heart and intensity stand way out." For the 85-pound shepherd, who understands commands only in German, it is all just one big game. In his youth, Dandy was trained to search for a terry-cloth towel that officers would lace with the scent of cocaine, heroin or marijuana. When he found the towel, it was his to chew on. Now, when he is asked to find the real thing, the dog thinks it's another version of hide-the-towel, says his handler, Monrovia Police Officer Rick Miglia. In his six years of duty -- which will end in January when the dog retires -- Dandy has played the game at least 450 times, leading to seizures of cash and narcotics valued at more than $1 billion, Miglia said. The Sylmar bust alone is expected to earn the Monrovia department $55,000 as its cut of the drug cash that was seized. "He thinks it's fun," said Miglia, a 10-year veteran. "He doesn't know what coke or heroin or marijuana is. All he knows is that towel." Not that his training hasn't had its rigors. Dandy isn't allowed to eat anything other than the dry dog food Miglia feeds him, a rule that helped keep him under control when he was once asked to search a meat market. Sex is strictly prohibited, thus limiting distractions in the event that a female dog in heat should cross his path while on the job. "I'm in awe when I watch him work," said Monrovia Police Officer Scott Wiese, who handles Deister Vom Derbickelwiese, the department's other police dog. "It just freaks me out; he's so smart." Back in 1982, when Dandy was just a pup in his native West Germany, the Kiwanis Club of Monrovia launched a fund-raising drive to bring a canine patrol to their small city east of Los Angeles. A local junkyard chipped in, a restaurant held a benefit dinner, and dozens of five-gallon water bottles at businesses around town were filled with the spare change of shoppers. The $20,000 raised was enough to purchase Dandy and a canine partner, Arko, who retired a year ago after putting the bite on a rapist. Despite such occasional incidents, the dogs are not vicious, their handlers say. They merely respond to the aggressiveness of the suspect, and then only when given a command to attack. Miglia, who takes Dandy home with him every day and will get to keep him when the dog retires, describes Dandy as a hard-working, well-mannered animal -- even if he does occasionally slobber on the windshield of their patrol car. "The cliche is that the handler's personality goes right down the leash to the dog," he said. "And it's unbelievably true."
19891130000000000	A COP'S BEST FRIEND DIES IN LINE OF DUTY. Hawthorne Police Officer Dave Harris wept over the death of his partner Tuesday. Harris is a dog handler in one of Hawthorne's four canine units, and his German shepherd Urko was run over by a car driven by a robbery suspect fleeing police Tuesday night. The car, traveling about 60 m.p.h., struck the dog at the intersection of 130th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard, went out of control and crashed, authorities said Wednesday. The dog's back was broken and he died a short time later at Coast Animal Hospital in Hermosa Beach, police said. The suspect was not seriously injured and was arrested at the scene. Harris also was uninjured, but distraught. "He was much more than just a pet," Harris said Wednesday. "He's your partner, he's a friend, and you couldn't ask for anything more." Urko's death in the line of duty came on the same day the department held a memorial service for another one of its dogs, which died recently of cancer. In the ceremony on the front lawn of the police station on 126th Street, about 100 mourners gathered to honor Iox, who had been with the department for more than seven years and had been retired in September because of his illness. About 20 canine handlers from police departments as far away as San Bernardino, along with their four-legged partners, lined the street that had been blocked off to traffic. Iox's handler, Officer Chet Wojciechowski, delivered a simple eulogy for a dog that understood only commands uttered in German. A similar ceremony is planned for Urko next Wednesday. "Dave . . . needs lots of support right now," Sgt. Rick Shindle, head of the Hawthorne canine unit, said of Harris. "That's what's nice about canine handlers from the other cities being here. They support each other. They know what it's like to lose a partner like that." Officers say the use of dogs in many departments has added a new element of camaraderie to a job in which officers must have confidence in the strength and ability of a partner. Harris, 33, a nine-year veteran of the department, said Urko died trying to protect him. The incident that took the dog's life began in Lakewood, when a 20-year-old suspect allegedly stole a car from a motorist at a gas station at gunpoint. The suspect led police on a chase through several cities. Harris and Urko, responding to a call for backup units, went to 130th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard. "Me and another guy and our partners blocked the streets with our cars," Harris said. "I saw the suspect coming at us real fast, and I saw that he wasn't going to stop. So I went back to my car to get my dog out of the way." When he opened his car door, Urko leaped out, he said. "He was all keyed up," Harris said. "He jumped out of the car looking for a bad guy, and when he realized there was no bad guy out there, he turned around to come back to me. And that's when he got hit." Harris said he was about 10 feet away from Urko when he was struck. "I ran over to my dog, and he just kind of looked up at me," Harris said, his voice breaking. "I went and got a blanket . . . and one of my partners took us to a 24-hour emergency clinic. "On the way there, he just kind of picked up his head and looked at me like he was saying goodby, and then he just flopped down." In the meantime, the police chase continued for another 10 blocks before the suspect lost control of the vehicle and it overturned, colliding with another car, police said. The second motorist was not injured, police said. Richard Garcia was booked on suspicion of robbery and causing injury or death to a police dog, a felony.
19901205000000000	DOG TRIGGERS BOMB SCARE AT AIR STATION. A Miramar Naval Air Station entrance was closed and nearby homes were evacuated for more than an hour Tuesday when a military police dog signaled its handler that a civilian car contained explosives, a Navy spokesman said. Knowing that the dog had a 100% reliability rate for substance detection and that the dog's signal is considered unusual, explosive-disposal experts were brought in from North Island about 12:45 p.m. to search the car, Chief Petty Officer Bobbie Carleton said. Navy personnel closed Miramar's north entrance and evacuated eight duplexes housing military families during the 80-minute search, which revealed no explosive material. "The sensitivity of these type of detection dogs is very high, so residue from an explosive substance on the seat of the car, for example, would have caused that dog to alert," Carleton said. The 3-year-old German shepherd was stationed at the gate as part of a periodically conducted random search for drugs, contraband, explosives and stolen property. The car, which belongs to a woman visiting the base, had recently been stolen and recovered, Carleton said.
19901217000000000	ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY OKS POLICE DOG FOR NARCOTICS SQUAD. The City Council has approved the addition of a dog to the police force to make narcotic searches quicker and easier. Police officials say a dog can search an area in half the time it would take five officers and can uncover hidden narcotics that would otherwise go undetected by humans. "To speed our job up, to make us more efficient, we feel we need this additional tool," Cmdr. Gary Biggerstaff told the council, which approved the plan unanimously. The dog will be assigned to an officer and will live in that officer's home. Police dogs usually work five to eight years. The dog will be able to detect marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines. Biggerstaff said that neighboring agencies could also use the dog. The Rotary Club of Los Alamitos will donate up to $6,000 for purchase and training costs and an additional $1,000 each year for food and medical expenses. The dog will go through about four months of training. The Police Department will also provide $1,000 for travel expenses and up to $1,000 more to purchase a dog house and other equipment. Narcotics officers have been borrowing dogs from other departments for the searches, but Biggerstaff said that those dogs were sometimes difficult to get because they were in such demand. TED JOHNSON
19891230000000000	INCIDENT PROBED AT LONG BEACH AIRPORT; SECURITY: TWO INTRUDERS ENTER A RESTRICTED AREA. ONE BOARDS A JUST-ARRIVED PLANE. THE FAA IS LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE SAFETY LAPSES.. The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it will investigate possible security lapses at Long Beach Airport after two men acting suspiciously got onto the Tarmac and one made it aboard an Alaska Airlines jet as passengers were leaving. The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft was grounded temporarily Thursday evening and searched by police and by bomb-sniffing dogs, but nothing was found, authorities said. Both men fled before airport security officers arrived. An Alaska Airlines spokesman said 55 passengers who were to have boarded the plane for a flight to Oakland and Seattle were placed on another scheduled flight at 7:15 p.m. The grounded aircraft, which had been taken to a remote area of the airfield, was back in service Friday morning, said Greg Witter, manager of media relations for the Seattle-based carrier. Witter emphasized that the 135-seat plane was searched only as a routine precautionary measure, and that no threat had been received or suspicious object seen. Witter said the incident began about 5:45 p.m. Thursday, when an Alaska Airlines employee noticed two men standing in a restricted area on the Tarmac near Flight 170, which had arrived from San Jose about 20 minutes earlier. When asked what they were doing, the men told a flight attendant that they worked there, presumably referring to the airport, Witter said. Moments later, an Alaska Airlines gate attendant approached them as one of the men bolted up the stairs to the waiting aircraft. The man on the ground said his companion was looking for something he had left behind on the plane. Again he indicated that he worked at the airport, but declined to produce identification and finally walked away. Aboard the plane, where a stewardess was helping some elderly passengers leave, the second man told flight attendants he had left something behind, Witter said. When questioned again, the man bolted out of the plane and into the terminal, eluding pursuing flight attendants. "It was just enough suspicious activity . . . that airline personnel felt it necessary to check the plane to see if there was a problem," said Long Beach Police Lt. Greg Whinery, whose department was notified of the incident about 6 p.m. Long Beach officers searched the plane twice without results, according to Whinery. Then members of the Los Angeles County sheriff's bomb squad and specially trained dogs borrowed from the Los Angeles Police Department conducted a third uneventful search before the plane was cleared. The men, described as being of average height and build and in their early to mid-20s, were never found, Whinery said. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke said the incident was reported to the FAA as required, and that the agency will conduct a routine investigation of airport and airline security procedures. If lapses in security or violations of federal aviation regulations are found, Brekke said, the airport and the airline could face fines of $10,000.
