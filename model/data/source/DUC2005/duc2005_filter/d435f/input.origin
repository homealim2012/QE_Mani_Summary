19910501000000000	FT  01 MAY 91 / Scots population rise. THE GENTLE decline in Scotland's population was reversed last year for the first time since the mid-1970s because of an influx of migrants. In the year to June 30 1990 the population rose by 11,700 to 5,102,400, according to Scotland's registrar general.
19930208000000000	FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (11): Crisis looms - Population Growth. FIFTEEN years ago, under the rule of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Iran was hard put to meet the needs of its 29m population. Now, after revolution, eight years of destructive war, a fall in the oil price and an explosion in the birth rate, it faces a far worse population crisis. Even before the revolution, many Iranians saw having many children as a sign of God's blessing. With the accession to power of Ayatollah Khomeini, producing more Moslems became a political as well as religious duty. Every Iranian born was an arrow through the heart of the Great Satan (the US), he told his flock. The nation took up his call with an enthusiasm that resulted in today's population of 60m. The war with Iraq, with its human-wave tactics and devastating casualties, added extra impetus to the task of giving birth to more Moslems. Fifteen years later, the Health Ministry admits that some 37 per cent of Iranian children under seven are malnourished. Homelessness, unemployment, illiteracy and poverty have increased. Mr Mohammed Hashemi, head of the Iranian Broadcasting Service, is often taken to task for not doing enough to spread the family planning message. He says: 'You say put on programmes about birth control, but when I do our phone lines are jammed with fathers saying 'My 14 year-old daughter is listening, take this programme off.'' According to Mr Mohammed Reza Malakzadeh, health minister, the birth rate now stands at 33 per thousand of population with 45.5 per cent of Iranians aged under 14. 'The proportion of employed to unemployed people is 1:1 in Iran, compared with 2:32 in Japan,' Mr Malekzadeh says. 'In the last ten years the gulf between the resources the country needs and what is available has grown alarmingly. We have not had time to catch up with the hospitals and beds needed, because of the growth of the population,' he explained. To cope with the present population, Iran needed 40,000 new classrooms, 500,000 residential units, 600,000 new jobs and Dollars 5bn invested in the agricultural sector. Mr Mohammad Ali Najafi, education minister, faces similar problems. 'Uncontrolled student population growth is one of the dire consequences of the rise in population. To keep up with the population growth we need 10,000 university-educated teachers each year. At present we can only answer 60 per cent of educational needs,' he said. For Mr Massoud Roghani-Zanjani, vice-president and head of the Plan and Budget Organisation, the answer is to remove all the incentives previously introduced to encourage reproduction. Two years ago, the government actively encouraged large families, giving them extra ration coupons, help with housing, and subsidies for childrens' clothing. Most incentives have now gone, but Mr Roghani-Zanjani wants to see the last ones removed and penalties imposed. Although the population growth rate has eased slightly - 3.3 per cent in 1988-89 to 2.7 per cent this year - more women are now reaching reproductive age and they are the ones the government is most anxious to reach with its family planning message. Mr Malekzaden says that population control is top of his agenda. Measures introduced include free contraception and free sterilisation at 400 hospitals nationwide. His ministry claims that 200,000 people were sterilised in 1991. But at the end of the day, it was the policies of the clerics which aggravated the problem and it is they who must solve it. Foremost in the war on population growth is Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi, a senior theologian at the Qom seminary. He admits that the Koran encourages large families. But he argues that an important factor in Islam is the instruction to 'take account of time and location'. He argues that no religious 'law-maker' would argue that 'it is better to have 100bn uneducated, poor and unhealthy people, than to have 60m living in good conditions.' Today's message, according to the Ayatollah, is that 'the man who stood proud and said I have seven children must learn that he must apologise instead.'
19930327000000000	FT  27 MAR 93 / Pressure of people to test the west: Migration has focused attention on soaring world population. Industrialised countries will be confronted with an unprecedented influx of would-be immigrants in the next few decades, putting their economies under enormous pressure. That is the message delivered by Mrs Nafis Sadik, director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), to the UN conference on European population this week in Geneva. More than 2m immigrants are believed to have entered both Europe and North America over the past two years alone. While Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have so far taken the brunt of Russians, gypsies and Romanians from the east, political chaos in Russia could intensify westward migration. This is quite apart from the pressures from the south, Mrs Sadik warned. Migration, many UN officials and economists in Geneva argued, would be the factor spurring industrialised countries to pay more attention to the world's soaring population. Prince Charles pointed out that at last June's Earth Summit in Rio, the link between numbers of people and destruction of the natural environment was conspicuous by its absence from the agenda. The Vatican's resistance to including population in the talks was unsurprising, but the Philippines and some Middle Eastern countries with high birth rates also proved obstructive. Environmental pressure groups, wary of telling developing countries how to manage their affairs, were also quiet. Such reticence is difficult to understand in the light of UN population projections - one puts the world's population at 11bn in 2050, double its present 5.5bn, before it stabilises. Mr Miroslav Macura, demographer with the UN Economic Commission for Europe, reminded the conference that the total 'could be anywhere from 5bn to 20bn' if fertility rates turned out to differ even marginally from the model's assumptions. Nearly 95 per cent of the projected rise will come from developing countries, despite the considerable success of many Asian and Latin American countries in bringing down the rate of population growth in the past two decades. India now has a fertility rate of about 4 - the average number of children per woman implied by the current birth rate - a fall of about a third in the last two decades. China, after its ferocious policy of curbing family size, has a rate of about 2.4, though that is still above the two children per woman which maintains a static population. But across much of sub-Saharan Africa, fertility rates have been running at more than 6. Recent studies, although based on less than perfect data, suggest the Aids epidemic is cutting only 1 percentage point off population growth. Ethiopia, despite recurrent famine, still has a fertility rate of about 3. According to Mr Fred Sai, president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and chairman of Ghana's population council, African countries now recognise that family planning is a tool for health improvement. But the answers to restraining a high growth rate of population are not clear-cut. Recent evidence shows that the traditional assumption that family size falls with economic progress does not always hold true. Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bulgaria and Kerala in India have all shown sharp falls in family size despite relatively low prosperity, while the Gulf states have maintained fertility rates of more than 3 during a period of sharply rising wealth. 'For every level of prosperity, you can find an enormous range of fertility rates,' said Mr David Coleman from Oxford University. 'The things that really bring down family size are more complex, to do with culture and education'. Contraceptive programmes do help though, the UNFPA, maintains: it called last week for the present total of Dollars 4.5bn spent worldwide on family planning programmes to double by 2000. But even if such measures are successful, the population of developing countries will continue to surge ahead that of industralised countries. Fertility rates in western Europe now average only about 1.7 children per woman - the UK rate is 1.8. Italy and Spain have rates of only 1.2, below West German levels of 1.4, according to Ms Charlotte Hohn director of the Federal Population Institute of Germany. The result is that pensioners will soon outnumber children in Europe and North America for the first time, the UNFPA said. Under-15s currently outnumber the elderly by a third in Europe and North America. But the number of people older than 60 has risen from 90m in 1950 to 185m today, and could reach 310m in 2025. The idea that any resulting labour gap could be filled by immigration is disputed. Mr Coleman argued that 'only about 60 per cent of the potential workforce in western Europe is actually working, and there is plenty of slack.' Past immigration can adversely affect the host country, he added. The availability of cheap labour may be one factor behind Europe's relative lack of investment in high-technology industries, he said. It is clear from west European delegates that the increasing pressures of migration are likely to prompt a tightening of frontiers to try to preserve standards of living for their own citizens. But if the arguments that Europe does not need immigrants to maintain prosperity are right, its cultural urge to shut the doors may not have adverse economic consequences.  ------------------------------------------------ Immigration pressure on developed countries from growth in developing countries' population  ------------------------------------------------                      Pop in   Increase (million)              1991   by 2005  ------------------------------------------------ Western Europe          379       4 Eastern Europe          124      11 Ex-Soviet Union         209      10 US                      253      81 Mediterranean*          186     158 Latin America           451     289 Tropical Africa         531     826 South Asia            1,206     920  ------------------------------------------------ Source: D Coleman, Oxford University *south-east Mediterranean  ------------------------------------------------
19930614000000000	FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (13): Escaping Islam's past - The role of women in society. ONE OF the key reasons President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali is opposed to granting legal recognition to the al Nahda (Renaissance) opposition party - whose creed is Islam - is fear that such a move risks undoing what many Tunisians regard as their country's proudest achievement since independence; the corpus of laws which, in 1956, abolished polygamy and gave Tunisian women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world. The 'Personal Status Code' is, arguably, former president Habib Bourguiba's greatest single achievement. It was promulgated the year Tunisia gained independence from France, a year before the new constitution that abolished the monarchy. The rights of women were further consolidated last August by the national assembly. In the case of divorce, for instance, custody no longer goes automatically to the husband. Violence against women within the family is punishable, women can request a passport without going through their father or husband and the state helps divorced women to secure alimony. Since 1956 a policy of family planning has been in place. In the early 1960s free and confidential advice and prophylactics were made available to women. Combined with efforts to promote health and education, these policies reduced population growth from 3.2 to 1.9 per cent. The birth rate has declined from 45 to 25.4 per thousand, mortality from 15 to 6.1 per thousand. The illiteracy rate has been brought down from 87.7 per cent to 35 per cent, though the figure is higher among women in poorer country areas. Women are increasingly visible in teaching, medicine, architecture - in factories as workers, engineers, managers and owners. But Tunisian politics remains very much a man's world, despite some remarkable exceptions, including Fethia Baccouche and Hanoun Houda, who are deputies, two secretaries of state and a handful of senior civil servants such as Fayza Kefi, whose presides over the Union Nationale des Femmes de Tunisie. Most educated women have no lost love for the teachings of radical Islamic groups. Though al Nahda leaders have said they accept many of Mr Bourguiba's inheritance, women are mindful of the often violent track record of some supporters of the party, notably the throwing of acid in the faces of university students on the campus in Tunis. History teaches women that radical Islam has not been sympathetic to the idea of equality between sexes or to their presence in public places. The history of modern Tunisia suggests that the emancipation of women has been a key factor in explaining the country's social and economic progress since 1956. Economic progress has provided a means of emancipation which is far from negligible. When a new law in 1973 allowed joint ventures to be established for the first time in Tunisia with offshore tax status, a string of factories set up across the country, giving many young women their first taste of freedom. The simple act of walking to work a few hundred yards from home, away from the all powerful mother, broke many taboos. These women were not well paid but what little they earned allowed them to build up a dowry and gain a measure of freedom in choosing their husband. Once married, many were able to claim help from the state to buy a flat. Women have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of jobs in industry, 22 per cent of jobs in the growing services sector, 40 per cent of jobs in agriculture, where they manage nearly 10 per cent of all farms. They are present everywhere, seldom veiled, and give Tunis and other major towns a strong Mediterranean feel. Last year's laws are ahead of the social mores of many Tunisians, yet they also reflect the fast changing attitudes affecting many sectors of society. About ten per cent of new companies are created by women, according to Aziza Dargouth, who runs the Cabinet de Prospective Sociale consulting agency. Hayet Laouni had her first job as secretary in a shipping company, 26 years ago, after training to become a primary school teacher. She now owns and runs Stumar, a company with turnover of Dollars 3m and is active in stevedoring, conveyancing and forwarding. She concedes it has not been easy for a woman to win acceptance in such a milieu, but as she moves around her office, cigarette in hand, firing orders, inquiring whether a particular container has arrived, the feeling Tunisia is undergoing a quiet revolution is overwhelming. Sarah Sahdallah owns and runs a porcelain factory, Ibtissem Kamoun has become one of Tunisia's largest producers of ice-cream, Rashida Rouissi exports fruit and vegetables. Scores of others are involved in textiles, ice cream and software. Such people would not quarrel with the policy of the Minister of Education, the highly respected Mohammed Charfi, who is having references in school text books that men are superior to women and adulterous women be stoned expurgated. The books of Hassan El Banna, the founder of modern fundamentalism, have been withdrawn from schools and public libraries. To western critics of such moves, many Tunisians point out that wealthy Saudis have, for the past two decades, been subsidising the printing and distributing of books offering the most conservative interpretation of Islam. Why should they be criticised for trying to promote more liberal views? Educated Tunisian women are well aware that some of their sisters support al Nahda. They agree with attempts to liberalise the economy and are convinced economic growth and a more broadly liberal society are the only serious ways to fight radical Islam. They are fearful of the possible spillover effects of events in neighbouring Algeria and Egypt.
19931118000000000	FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (31): The population puzzle - Experts search for reasons for a dip in the fertility rates. SHANGHAI'S population has stopped growing because the birth rate has fallen so low, according to China's ministry of family planning. That claim does not take account of peasants flocking to the city's construction sites or the sprawl of the new suburbs. But if true, it reflects the success of China's population programme, one of the most ambitious and internationally controversial aspects of its policy. For nearly two decades, China has been trying to curb the growth of its population in order to raise living standards and restrain pressure on scarce resources. Latest government figures put the total at 1.17bn: China now has a nearly quarter of the world's population on around seven per cent of the world's arable land. Estimates of the future population are staggering. The United Nations' central projection is that by 2050, the total could reach 1.52bn. But tiny changes in assumptions about family size produce a wide range: from as little as 1.23bn in 2050 up to an astounding 1.9bn in 2050 (and 2.4bn in 2150), although demographers regard the highest figures as unlikely. The core of China's policy is to limit couples to one child, mainly through financial incentives. In Beijing, couples pay 10 per cent of their income for a second child and a further 15 per cent for a third. In practice, they may also lose promotion, housing and other benefits. The programme has also aggressively promoted contraception, principally intra-uterine devices, sterilisation, condoms and pills. Abortion is also widely available: the ministry reports one abortion for every two live births. Much foreign criticism has centred on press reports of compulsory abortion and sterilisation. Beijing has generally called these reports exaggerated, but the family planning ministry acknowledges that some local officials may be inadequately trained - 'around 60 per cent of staff at township level left school at around 15 years old - they do not have enough knowledge of contraceptives,' says the ministry. It is clear that the policy has had a dramatic effect. According to government figures this year, the fertility rate - the average number of children per woman implied by current birth rates - has fallen to around 1.9 from 2.25 in 1990. That is nearly as low as western European and US rates, and less than half that of India. The reasons for the fall have puzzled population experts, given the partial relaxation of the one-child policy in the mid-1980s - 'we were certainly surprised when the figures came through,' says Mr Carl Haub, a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau, an independent Washington-based research organisation. Some analysts speculate on an unpublicised toughening of policy; others question whether the fall is sustainable. The headline figures also hides other concerns. The policy has been more effective in the cities than in the rural areas, where three quarters of people live, and where the average number of children per family is still 2.6. 'The countryside is still a problem - they work with their hands and believe that they need more hands,' officials say. The policy also appears to have encouraged a disproportionate number of baby boys, traditionally preferred to girls in China. Ultrasound machines - which can detect the sex of the foetus - are now widespread, although abortion on those grounds is officially discouraged. According to the family planning ministry, in Zhejiang province in the Yangtze Delta, the proportion of boys to girls has reached 118 to 100 compared to the normal 104. Demographers stress that given these tensions, and the scale of social change now under way in China, particurlarly growing affluence and migration to the cities, the future is highly uncertain. In Mr Haub's words: 'Who knows what China will look like in 30 years time? The range of prospects for its population is enormous.'
19940131000000000	FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (2): Reality remains taboo / A look at world population projections. According to United Nations forecasts, the population of the world is likely to double - to more than 10bn people - by the middle of the next century. This will be one of the biggest forces shaping living standards of future generations. Although growth will take place almost entirely in developing countries, few countries will be able to insulate themselves from the effects. However, population growth was a taboo topic at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, although it is the source of increasing pressure on natural resources and the environment in many regions. Governments felt that the sensitivity of the issue was so great - provoking debates about differing cultural and religious values - that it would frustrate attempts to reach agreement on other fronts. Even at the time of the summit the omission appeared a serious weakness, as Prince Charles pointed out. In retrospect, that is clearly true. Although countries put their names to Rio's two treaties on climate change and bio-diversity (the variety of the world's wildlife), many have found difficulty in drawing up realistic plans for curbing environmental damage. The omission has also allowed the notion of 'sustainable development' to remain confused. That principle, which governments attending Rio pledged to observe, does not define whether resources are to be preserved at a certain level for each person or simply for each country. Countries with rapidly growing populations will find it almost impossible to preserve resources - however defined - on a per capita basis. But although the projected increase in the world's population is formidably large, it is much less than many people feared two decades ago. Prominent among 1970s doomsters, the Club of Rome (an international group of industrialists, scientists, economists and statesmen) predicted that food, energy and raw materials would run out. Since then, food production has increased while population has slowed. The drop in the birth rate in many countries now looks like one of the development successes of the past two decades. Many Asian and Latin American countries have had particular success in bringing down the rate of population growth. India, for example, now has a fertility rate - the average number of children per woman implied by the current birth rate - of about four. That figure shows a fall of about one third over the past two decades - although still higher than the figure of just over two children per woman which would maintain a static population. However, across much of sub-Saharan Africa, fertility rates have been running at more than six children per woman. Demographers studying why some countries have had more success than others point out that there is no straightforward formula to apply. Longstanding assumptions that as a country develops, its birth rate falls, fail to explain some of the patterns now observed. Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bulgaria and Kerala in India have all shown sharp falls in family size despite relatively low prosperity, while the Gulf states have maintained fertility rates of more than three children per woman during a period of fast economic growth. Instead, demographers are having to put together a more complex picture, in which access to contraception, the level of female education and the availability of jobs for women all play a part. There has also been international concern about the measures sometimes employed to restrain birth rates, particularly in China, which has fiercely applied limits on family size. The scale of China's problem is undeniable: China now has nearly a quarter of the world's population on about 7 per cent of the world's arable land. According to government figures this year, the fertility rate has fallen to about 1.9 from 2.25 children per woman in 1990. That is nearly as low as western European and US rates, and less than half that of India. But the measures used by the Chinese government - including limiting urban families to one child - have provoked criticism that the Chinese government is infringing human rights. Despite those qualifications, the falls in many countries' birth rates have outstripped expectations. But demographers and environmentalists warn against complacency, even if the doom-mongers have not been proved right. They point out that even at current rates, population growth will still put severe pressures on natural resources and on the quality of the environment. They also argue that the ageing of the populations in industrialised countries and the steady fall in the average age of the population in developing countries will bring further pressures. Children under 15 years old currently outnumber the elderly by one third in Europe and North America. But pensioners will soon outnumber children in Europe and North America for the first time, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has said. Mr David Coleman, a demographer at Oxford University, says that environmental degradation, pressure on resources and the search for jobs will cause industrialised countries to be confronted with an unprecedented influx of immigrants from poorer countries. Mrs Nafis Sadik, director of UNFPA, has also warned of these pressures - even taking account only those who have already been born. More than 2m immigrants are believed to have entered both Europe and North America over the past two years alone. So far, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have taken the brunt of Russians, gypsies and Romanians from the east, but political chaos in Russia could intensify westward migration. Governments and international agencies for aid, development and the environment may still be coy about addressing issues of curbing population growth. But they will increasingly find the subject unavoidable. Worries about consumption of resources and degradation of the environment are well-established. But migration may be the factor which finally makes countries worldwide - industrialised as well as developing - face these questions.
19940913000000000	FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (7): Cost of growth on the environment - Social conditions may be about to improve. Sao Paulo city is an ill-fitting muddle of the developed and developing world. While all but the poorest houses have electricity and running water, less than half the city's domestic sewage is treated. Infant mortality and illiteracy are among the lowest in Brazil, but levels of violence and air pollution are among the highest. While the city's population growth has slowed considerably, at least 1m people still live in shanty towns, known as favelas, which dot the city's outskirts. This dichotomy has its roots in Sao Paulo's rapid growth over the past 50 years. Until the second world war, the city was a provincial centre grown rich on coffee profits. As industrialisation gathered pace, it attracted immigrants from poorer parts of Brazil, especially the north-east. Between 1940 and 1970 the city grew at about 5 per cent a year, from a population of 1.3m to 5.9m. Growth started to slow only in the 1980s, but not before the population had nearly doubled, reaching 9.5m in 1991. Industrial suburbs that were once separated from the city by green belts have merged into a single urban sprawl. If these suburbs are included, the population of the greater Sao Paulo metropolitan area is over 15m, making it the largest urban centre in South America. Sao Paulo's attraction has always been its economy. Until the beginning of the 1980s, industrial employment grew steadily and offered even semi-skilled immigrants the chance of relative prosperity. As Brazil's economic crisis struck in the 1980s, Sao Paulo's informal economy - ranging from armies of street sellers to gambling networks - provided a cushion against rising unemployment. Families have continued to arrive in the city over the past 10 years, although in much smaller numbers. Many still regard a poorly-paid job with a one-room apartment in Sao Paulo as preferable to staying in Brazil's rural areas. In the city, they have access to better services and opportunities for their children. Sao Paulo's rapid growth extracted a very high price from the city's environment. Urban growth was so rapid it overlooked the desirability of keeping 'buffer' areas undeveloped to improve leisure options and air quality. Extreme reliance on automobiles means air quality is usually poor. The city's main river, the Tiete, has become overburdened. Every day, it has to digest more than 1,000 tonnes of organic waste and about three tonnes of untreated inorganic waste, including chemicals and heavy metals; however, a state government clean-up is under way. There has also been a heavy social cost. The need to accelerate government spending on infrastructure and education has left other sectors underfunded. In the southern municipality of Diadema, which grew rapidly from the 1960s because it is close to Sao Paulo's car manufacturers, health centres are only now being installed. The public transport system has also failed to keep pace. Despite the city's size, its underground railway system is still restricted to three lines. In satellite cities around Sao Paulo, workers have to rely on buses and poor traffic conditions. Father Antonio Carlos Frizzo, of Guarulhos, near Sao Paulo's international airport, says that his parishioners spend three hours a day on buses getting to and from the city. The heavy strains imposed by such conditions are one reason for the growth of radical protestant churches. Social strains have also led to growing violence. In some poorer suburban regions, the murder rate is 90 per 10,000 inhabitants. However, there are areas of low violence, mainly in the centre. The city's overall murder rate is only slightly higher than New York's. Col Hermes Bittencourt Cruz, of the Sao Paulo police, links violence and other crime to the continuing process of urbanisation, poor education and one of the world's highest income disparities. 'Violence is a perverse result of disorganised development,' he says. Mr Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, of the centre for the study of violence at the University of Sao Paulo, complains of a lack of resources and skills in the judicial and police systems. In Sao Paulo there is one judge per 20,000 people, compared to one per 5,000 in Europe. Despite these challenges, Sao Paulo's rapid fall in population growth will allow better planning of infrastructure and services in the years ahead. Along with the rest of Brazil, Sao Paulo is also developing some institutions that are common to industrialised economies - from health and education networks in the shanty towns to environmental pressure groups. 'We have grave institutional problems, but our civil society has changed tremendously in the last 30 years,' Mr Pinheiro says.
19940912000000000	FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (5): Compromising for Cairo - Population growth has divided government and church. This summer's flare-up in relations between the government and the Philippine Roman Catholic church was bound to happen eventually. In a desire to show that overall economic growth is actually touching the lives of its 66.5m people, the government has sought to slow the population growth rate. At the rate of expansion that was running at 2.3-2.4 per cent when the Ramos administration took over, population growth was an obvious priority. It set out to reduce the figure to less than 2 per cent by the end its six-year term. High population growth has been identified as one reason why the Philippines has remained a laggard in a region of rapid economic region. Since 1980, for instance, the economy has recorded a net growth of only about 1.5 per cent, while the rest of its neighbours live in prosperity. About half of the Philippine population is estimated to live in poverty. The government hopes to cut that to 30 per cent by 1998. In its medium-term plan, it has declared a family-planning programme as a key component of its 'health, nutrition, and family planning services'. Herein lies the heart of the conflict. In contrast to the laid-back response of his predecessor, Mr Fidel Ramos has pursued an aggressive population programme that promotes the use of contraceptives. This has escalated over the last few months, with government commercials on radio and television advocating the use of condoms, pills and other contraceptive devices. The campaign was recently widened to include sex education among schoolchildren. Mr Ramos, the Philippines' first Protestant president in a predominantly (85 per cent) Catholic country, was apparently gaining some headway, since latest official estimates showed that population growth in the first half of 1994 was about 2.1 per cent. This, government estimates show, has led to an increase in per-capita output in the first half, for the first time since 1990. In late July, Cardinal Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, issued a 'letter to parents', in which he accused the government of a 'destructive' policy on population, including the promotion of abortion and the use of pornographic materials for sex education among children. The outburst was triggered by the government's apparent support, church leaders said, for a document presented at this month's United Nations conference on population and development, in Cairo. However, the government expressed surprise. Health officials said it had not been promoting abortion or 'sexual propaganda', but had been 'providing natural and artificial methods, but we rest the decision on the woman, her reproductive rights and her choices.' Cardinal Sin asked the government to send to the Cairo conference delegates 'with sane minds', and to oppose moves to introduce abortion. While other church leaders have singled out the US as being behind moves to push abortion at the conference, the cardinal said: 'Global forces . . . are poised to bombard our children . . . with reading materials and films containing all sorts of pornographic, perverse and poisonous sexual propaganda as part of their 'education'.' The church followed up its harangue with a protest rally that drew hundreds of thousands (local press estimates put the size of the crowd at 1 million) to lambast the population programme and the government's stand over the Cairo conference. Mr Juan Flavier, health secretary, has remained calm during the raging debate. He has also dropped the 'pro-choice' slogan in promoting the various methods of family planning. He said he agreed with church leaders that 'it was not the proper phrase to use on such as sensitive issue'. The debate has recently been joined by the Protestant United Church of Christ of the Philippines, where Mr Ramos attends Sunday services. It said that 'women should have the power of choice' in such cases as rape or possible complicated deliveries. Another local denomination, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church), has accused the Catholic leaders of 'dictatorial' methods in promoting their objections to artificial family planning. 'Supposed to be a defender of freedom, the church does not allow its members to practise freedom,' complained Bishop Javier Gil Montemayor, a former Catholic, who heads the independent church. Where the conflict will end remains unclear. But the Malthusians in the Ramos government face their greatest challenge yet. The Catholic leaders and the government subsequently had two meetings, which reached agreement on a common stand against abortion at the Cairo conference. They also agreed to tackle the Philippine population issue itself after the UN gathering.
19940910000000000	FT  10 SEP 94 / Cairo women worlds apart from UN ideologues. In the gloom of 'Jimmy's' beauty parlour in the well- heeled Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, the United Nations prescriptions for the 'em- powerment of women', which are being forged in the city's nearby conference halls, seem a world away, writes Bronwen Maddox in Cairo. The walls of the parlour's cubicles for manicures and pedicures, decked out like underwater grottoes with sea shells, are scattered with soft-focus portraits of weddings and of intertwined hands wearing huge engagement rings. Much of the opposition which has surfaced in recent weeks to the proposed policies of the UN Conference on Population and Development has been provoked by the perceived threat to traditional patterns of families and marriage. One elegant woman leaving Jimmy's with coral-coloured nails to match her black and coral dress said the women's groups she had seen on television reports about the conference had seemed 'very feminist, very American. 'Egyptian men - and women - have very traditional ideas of the woman's place in the family and I don't think that will change,' she said. Dr Nafis Sadik, executive director of the UN Population Fund, who is chairing the conference, has stressed that the UN policy document does not threaten traditional notions of the family. That message has been reinforced by the Egyptian government, which wants to maintain public support for its family planning programme to combat overcrowding and poverty. This programme has seen the use of contraceptives rise from 28 per cent to 50 per cent in just over a decade. That has cut the annual growth in population from 2.8 per cent in 1980 to 2.2 per cent, although without further falls Egypt's population of 56m could still double by early next century. Outside the conference halls, however, it is easy to see how the UN proposals to increase women's educational opportunities, encourage them to marry later, and give them equal opportunities at work, seem uncomfortably foreign and militant. In particular, the UN exhortations that women should have equal rights at work are met with scepticism by many Cairo women. The kind of discrimination at work which Dr Sadik has been inveighing against is evident two doors up from Jimmy's, at Chez Samir, a renowned hairdressing salon. Washing and switching on the hairdryers is left to the quiet teenage girls, but it is made clear that the business of hair styling is the preserve of five men. They approach it like engineering, constructing a scaffolding of rollers, pins, steel grips and thick hairspray on top of client's head to get the greatest height possible. Judging from the reaction of customers and staff, Dr Sadik's fears that the enduring public memory of the conference will be the much-publicised row over abortion policy, rather than the central questions of contraception and women's rights, are justified. 'I am not against the conference, you understand,' says Miron, a Cairo dentist in her late 20s. 'But there has been so much fuss about abortion, I wonder if the conference has looked at the right questions.'
19940907000000000	FT  07 SEP 94 / False alarm in Cairo: Women's education, not ideology, is key to population control. While doing voluntary service as a teenager in French-speaking Africa, I shocked a Senegalese friend, a primary school teacher, by urging on him the virtues of contraception. 'Faut pas empecher les gosses de naitre, wai],' he expostulated: You mustn't stop kids being born. (Wai], an all-purpose vernacular exclamation, added emphasis to his statement.) A Moslem, though by no means a fundamentalist, my friend had unwittingly given a succinct summary of Catholic doctrine. I had trouble with it then, and I have trouble with it now. I've always thought the Catholic Church has a better case on abortion than most liberals and feminists are willing to allow: it hardly makes one an irrational fanatic to describe the deliberate destruction of an embryo human being as the 'taking of human life'. But the Church weakens its case enormously by pushing it back before conception. At that stage there is no individual human life to be taken: only a myriad potential combinations, almost all of which nature will rule out anyway. Nor is it obvious that the methods of avoiding conception which the church recommends are any more 'natural' than those it condemns. At the Cairo conference on population and development, Vatican delegates are struggling to remove 'pregnancy termination' from the list of things covered by 'reproductive healthcare' in the UN draft document and to salvage a phrase about 'taking appropriate steps to help women avoid abortion, which in no case should be presented as a method of family planning'. Vatican delegates have wisely avoided taking a stand on the contraception issue. They are not helped by TV footage from the Philippines, where last month Catholics, led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, demonstrated against the conference and their government's family planning policy, with banners proclaiming: 'Contraception = abortion = murder.' Similarly the conference's organisers must have been less than pleased with newspaper headlines yesterday suggesting that Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, won a standing ovation by calling for abortion to be legalised worldwide. They have taken pains to establish that this is not the conference's agenda. Mrs Brundtland herself complained that the agenda had been misrepresented, suggesting that the term 'reproductive healthcare' could not 'possibly be read as promoting abortion as a means of family planning'. But she clearly meant to take on the Vatican with two of her statements: that 'morality becomes hypocrisy if it means mothers suffering or dying in connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and unwanted children'; and that morality cannot 'only be a question of controlling sexuality and protecting unborn life'. It is a false quarrel about a false alarm. A false quarrel, because each side is attacking the other for a position which, in this conference at least, it is not attempting to defend. And a false alarm because the current prospect for world population growth is less catastrophic than the headlines suggest. In an essay just published in the New York Review of Books, Prof Amartya Sen, a leading expert on the economics of famine, reminds us that the rate of world population growth has fallen in the last two decades from 2.2 to 1.7 per cent, and 'is expected to go steadily down until the size of the world's population becomes nearly stationary'. The number at which it will eventually stabilise, around 10bn, still sounds alarmingly high. It is, but not - as many imagine - because most of those people will be hungry and poor: per capita incomes are rising and food is getting cheaper in those parts of the world where most of them are being born. The danger is the opposite: sooner or later most of them will be able to afford western lifestyles and consumption patterns, putting an unsustainable strain on the world environment. That problem will not be solved by population control alone, but anything we can do to accelerate the fall in the birth rate should help to make it more manageable. But Prof Sen makes a strong case that coercive or 'override' methods - those in which 'the family's personal decisions are overridden by some agency outside the family' - are unnecessary and perhaps ineffective, as well as being inhumane. The fall in China's birth rate since 1979 may, he suggests, be due less to the authoritarian one-child policy than to 'more collaborative and participatory' policies which have made education and jobs outside the home available to many Chinese women. The Indian state of Kerala, with 29m people, has reduced its birth and fertility rates below those of China without any state coercion. It is among the poorer Indian states (so economic growth is not in itself the solution, as is sometimes argued), but it resembles China in having 'high levels of basic education, healthcare and so on'. Most strikingly, it has higher rural literacy rates, male and female, than any Chinese province. China and Kerala have the advantage of being neither Moslem nor Catholic. But the birth rate is also falling rapidly in Iran (where there is good basic healthcare, and the authorities came round to family planning in 1988) and in most of South America. The Tablet, the British Catholic magazine, even claimed last month, with a certain chutzpah, that because it favours women's education 'the Catholic Church should be regarded as one of the most effective organisations in the world for reducing the rate of population growth'. In other words, the Pope should be congratulated for educating his female followers to the point where they can ignore his advice.
19940906000000000	FT  06 SEP 94 / Emancipation helps Tunisia to steady growth: A 'Personal Status Code' has given women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world. Amid all the controversy surrounding the United Nations Population Conference in Cairo, the example of one small Moslem country, Tunisia, traditionally tolerant and open to western influence, suggests the emancipation of women has been a significant factor in reducing population growth from 3.2 per cent a generation ago to 1.9 today. Vastly improved standards of education and health care are other ingredients which explain Tunisia's steady economic performance in recent years. Real growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1989 and inflation is running at a little over 3 per cent. Over two-thirds of all households own or are buying a house or apartment. The successful implementation of a structural readjustment programme has, since 1987, won plaudits from both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and contributed to the resilience of the economy in overcoming the impact of the Gulf War and, last winter, a severe drought. The tourist sector is attracting 2.5m Europeans this year and contributing an estimated Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) to exports of goods and services. Most striking is the coherence of the 'Personal Status Code', promulgated by former president Habib Bourguiba in 1956, the year Tunisia gained independence from France, which abolished polygamy and established all the laws governing family planning, divorce and the education of women which have given Tunisian women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world. In 1963, free prescriptions of the pill and free confidential advice on contraception were made available to women, 10 years before France. The programme spread to even the smallest village. The birth rate has declined from 45 to 24.4 per 1,000, mortality from 15 to 6.1 per 1,000. Illiteracy has been cut from 87.7 to 35 per cent, though the figure is higher among women in poorer areas. Women are increasingly visible in teaching, medicine and architecture, in factories as workers, engineers and owners. The world of politics remains very much a man's world, although the professional skills and sureness of touch which Mrs Neziha Mezhoud, minister in charge of family issues, and a growing number of other highly-articulate women bring to their jobs, suggests it is only a matter of years before senior cabinet posts will go to women. Though leaders of the opposition Islamic al Nahda (Renaissance) party have said they would accept many of Mr Bourguiba's policies, women are mindful of the often violent record of some supporters of the party, notably the throwing of acid in the faces of university students on the campus in Tunis. Many Tunisian women are convinced radical Islam is not sympathetic to the idea of equality between the sexes or to their presence in public places. The laws on divorce and alimony are remarkably close to their European counterparts. Indirectly, they allow women a far greater share of inheritance than the Koran allows. To bolster these moves, the books of people such as Hassan el Banna, the founder of modern fundamentalism, have been withdrawn from schools and public libraries, and references to the inferior status of women erased from all school books. Women today have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of all jobs in industry, 22 per cent in the growing services sector and 40 per cent in agriculture, where they manage 10 per cent of all farms. Ten per cent of all new companies are created by women. The cycle of emancipation, education, public presence, most notably in the workplace, success in the professions and industry helps to explain why a country of such slender natural resources has progressed so much faster, not least economically, than many of its peers in the Middle East and Africa.
19940905000000000	FT  05 SEP 94 / Youthful Brazil faces problems of old age: Life expectancy is rising while the birth rate is continuing to fall. Brazil looks set to enter the next century with 40m people 'missing'. According to projections made in the 1970s, its population would reach 212m by the year 2000. But according to latest predictions, the total will be far less, probably 172m. The reasons for the sharp slowdown in population growth are also seen in other Latin American countries. They include a drastic fall in female fertility rates, mainly due to increased use of contraceptives and rapid urbanisation. The consequences, which include an ageing society and serious strains on social and employment needs, have not yet been addressed. 'It is the population above 65 which will grow the most in the next decades. Brazil will have to live with this phenomenon, which is well known in developed countries, without having overcome typical problems related to under-development,' says demographics professor Jose de Carvalho. Brazil's population change started in the 1940s. Improved medical and basic services led to falling mortality rates. Fertility rates remained high until the end of the 1960s, leading to rapid population growth and a society with more than half its members under 20 years old. It also encouraged a belief, still held by many today, that Brazil was blessed with an eternally young and fast growing population. At the first international population conference in Bucharest in 1974, Brazil's population was 100m and expected to double rapidly. But the female fertility rate - the average number of births per child-bearing woman - began a startling fall from 5.8 in 1970 to 4.3 in 1975 and 3.6 by 1984. In a recent study of Sao Paulo state, Brazil's richest, the fertility rate was 2.3, in line with some developed countries. The fall was partly due to rising education and urbanisation, as families moved from agricultural to industrial jobs. But the main reason was increased access to, and demand for, contraception. By 1986, 66 per cent of women of child-bearing age said they were using some form of contraceptive. Of these, about 40 per cent had been sterilised and a further 40 per cent used the pill. By 1990, contraception use had risen to 69 per cent. These rates are high, considering Brazil is the world's largest Catholic country with a still conservative church hierachy. Abortion is illegal unless the woman has been raped or is in medical danger. Officially, the church promotes the Billings method, which teaches couples to avoid sex during ovulation. But very few couples obey, suggesting the church is, unofficially, more liberal than it appears or losing its sway. Padre Antonio Carlos Frizzo, whose parish is in the poor suburbs of Sao Paulo, says couples must choose. 'If a couple asked advice on sterilisation, which is rare, I would take into account their economic situation and number of children, the love between them and whether another method is possible. 'But the couple must decide, and that's something we should not and cannot try to stop. And their decision has to be supported, too. This might be criticised in the Vatican, but we are dealing with people in real situations,' he says. The increasing demand for sterilisation has a startling side-effect - it has helped make Brazil the world leader for caesarian births. These account for roughly one in three deliveries, about twice the rate for England and Wales. The reasons are complex. Some women think caesarian section a 'modern' way to give birth, a view hospitals encourage, while others fear the pain involved in vaginal deliveries. Another reason is that when giving birth by caesarian, a woman can request to be sterilised at the same time and the government pays. Outside pregnancy, women have to pay to be sterilised, usually at semi-legal clinics. The declining birth rate will transform Brazil over the coming decades. Population growth, which in the 1970s was 2.4 per cent, has fallen to 1.9 per cent and is still declining. Today, 35 per cent of the country's 157m population is under 15 years old. By 2020, the percentage will have fallen to 24 per cent. By about 2040, with a rapidly aging society, the population will reach about 220m and stabilise or even fall. This prompts the church and other anti-abortion groups to argue that population control is now obsolete in Brazil, especially given the country's undeveloped agricultural land. A more stable population will also allow better government planning. In the past, rapid population growth in cities, for example, has prevented governments developing long-term urban plans. But the changes will also provide some sobering challenges. The number of people of working age is set to grow 2.4 per cent a year for the next decade, adding to pressures on the economy to create jobs. The social security system, established when the average age at death was 45, must be reformed to cope with life expectancies of 64 and 69 for men and women respectively. The country's under-funded public health system must emphasise preventative medicine if it is to cope with the increasing demands of an ageing population. Finally, the growing number of elderly from smaller families will need extra services. Unfortunately, Brazil does not seem greatly aware of these challenges. Because of the government's economic problems, the 1990 census was postponed to 1991. After further spending cuts, only basic findings are available.
19940902000000000	FT  02 SEP 94 / Where Egypt boasts decade of progress: Population curbs have worked, but there is still far to go. None of the women attending the Cairo Family Planning Association clinic in the sprawling suburb of Zeinhom yesterday knew that the world's biggest population conference was due to open up the road on Monday. Few probably cared; none seemed the least persuaded that seeking family planning advice might be un-Islamic. 'I'm convinced Islam is not against family planning,' said Hoda, a 30-year-old woman swathed in a black Hejab veil, the badge of Islamic piety. 'My brother-in-law is a religious man and he ordered his wife not to use contraception. He tried to deter me, but I didn't listen. I encouraged all my friends to come to the clinic. Now all of them blossom like fresh jasmine.' Hoda has stopped at five children, and was having a routine check on her IUD, a visit which cost 25 piastres (about 5p) at this private clinic. Her 21-year-old sister had come along too. She has two daughters and said that was enough: 'I have an IUD, and don't plan to have any more children. My husband would like a son, but he doesn't pressure me.' For most women visiting the clinic, said Dr Mawahab el-Mouelhy, a UK and US-educated doctor, birth control is a practical consideration, determined usually by women's concerns for their health and, perhaps more commonly, because they simply cannot afford to clothe, feed, educate or house more children. For all the criticism by Egypt's religious conservatives of the population policy agenda of Monday's International Conference on Population and Development, the strictures of Islam have so far done little to put a brake on a decade of progress in population control, which Egypt's policymakers and aid workers consider little short of remarkable. The population growth rate has plunged from 3 per cent to about 2.1 per cent. A fertility rate of 5.3 in 1980 has come back to an average of 3.9 births per woman, 2.9 in urban areas. Knowledge of family planning among married couples is almost universal, while 47 per cent of women use contraception in Egypt (predominantly IUD devices and the pill) against 24 per cent in 1980. Behind such results lie 20 years of concerted government policy, backed by foreign aid, of which USAID has provided 75 per cent of all family planning assistance, a total of about Dollars 170m (Pounds 113m), to fill the media with birth control information and stock and staff hundreds of clinics, enough for 96 per cent of all Egyptian women to be within 5km of a family planning centre. But cheered as the government and organisations such as USAID are by such results, they remain far from meeting their ambition of creating for Egypt a population growth which the country can comfortably sustain. At present rates, Egypt's 60m population grows by 1m every 10 months. The constraints on the country's most basic resources are severe enough; all but 4 per cent of its 1m sq km is desert. A recent report by the UN's Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia reckoned Egypt was consuming 95 per cent of its available water sources and faced a water deficit by the year 2000. By most estimates, the economy needs to generate about 500,000 jobs a year to mop up new entrants to the labour force, implying an annual growth rate of 5 per cent of GDP, more than twice the most optimistic estimates of present growth. The World Bank reckons that at least 5m new jobs must be created by 2000 even to halve the present unemployment rate of 20 per cent. But population experts tend to agree that cutting the growth rate to perhaps 1.9 per cent is unlikely to come by providing more pills, coils or publicity campaigns alone. 'There is something missing,' says Dr el-Mouelhy. 'Which is the status of women in this country. We need to work hard on this. It's not just family planning, its about education of women.' Emphasis on the education of girls is a central theme of the conference's draft document to be discussed next week in Cairo, and one which groups such as USAID and the Population Council hope the conference's hosts will take to heart. A well established concomitant between raised educational standards among girls and subsequent falls in fertility rates is seen as the key to future policy in countries such as Egypt, these groups argue. A guide to the task lying ahead for Egypt lies in the fact that, by conservative estimates, at least 66 per cent of Egyptian women are illiterate. Changing that will require more than the provision of teachers and schools, of which Egypt must already build on average one a day to keep up with the rise in schoolchildren. It will need an attempt to alter many ingrained attitudes, and is likely to depend on an improved economic climate. All that before the air can thicken with the scent of jasmine.
19940901000000000	FT  01 SEP 94 / Birth-rate successes moderate Iran's stance: A look at attempts to rein in alarming fertility rates as population hits 60m. The Iranian government's opposition to next week's United Nations population conference is not so great that it will join Saudi Arabia and Sudan in boycotting it. Iran is sending a delegation which it hopes will 'adapt the final document to incorporate religious ethics'. Criticism of the Cairo conference centres on the pragmatic approach taken towards issues such as extramarital and adolescent sex. Mr Ali Reza Marandi, Iran's health minister, said earlier this week, that the draft document 'seemed to have disregarded the religious views of the Islamic world and formulated the text with a sense of sexual liberty'. Iran's own religious ethics underwent revision toward population control in 1988, when the government recognised the severity of the country's high population growth rate. The average population growth rate of 3.9 per cent a year in the early 1980s was among the highest in the world. The Islamic government, which took over after the 1979 revolution, laid greater emphasis than before on early marriage and the woman's role as wife and mother and saw no reason to encourage birth control. It welcomed the growth in population, seeing it in terms of increased resources to build the country into an Islamic model. By the mid-80s, however, concerns about the economy led to fears that the high population growth was a threat rather than an aid to economic development. Iran's population grew from just over 37m at the beginning of the revolution in 1979 to 57m by 1986, an increase attributed to the lack of a family planning programme combined with improved health care since the 1960s. Today, Iran's population is believed to stand at more than 60m. Implementation of a family planning programme in 1988 has witnessed a drop in the annual average growth rate from the 3.9 per cent peak to 2.3 per cent last year and down further to 1.8 per cent in July, according to government figures. Demographic experts, while acknowledging that Iran has been successful in controlling its population growth, are sceptical of these figures. They argue that such a rapid population decrease is impossible in such a short period of time and cite the need for strengthened data collection and statistical analysis. The most reliable figures are those of the country's census, taken every five years. This showed an annual average growth rate of 2.9 per cent in 1991, well above the current 2 per cent growth rate for developing countries. Subsequent figures have been based on less reliable samples. Mr Shu Yun Xu, Iran country director at the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), says that despite the controversial figures, Iran's family planning programme has been 'a great achievement', partly because of the strength of the government's commitment. 'It has been supportive of all contraceptive methods, including male sterilisation. Only abortion is not allowed.' In June, the UNFPA approved a Dollars 10m five-year country programme for Iran and part of the funds are allocated to improving Iran's demographic data collection. The main thrust of the government's population control programme has been based on an increased supply of contraceptives, the training of rural midwives and counselling in family planning techniques. The Ministry of Health, which established a Fertility Regulation Council in 1988 to implement the programme, reports a decline in total fertility from 6.4 children per woman in 1988 to 4.25 in 1993. Increase use of contraceptives has been partly fuelled by the lack of family planning services for almost a decade. An active family planning programme was launched under the Shah's regime, so the implementation of the current programme has been relatively easy given the public's existing awareness. Another reason for the success of the family planning programme has been a relatively good health infrastructure which, according to UNFPA reaches 60 per cent of those living in the countryside and 90 per cent of the majority urban population. Mr Xu said: 'The primary healthcare network is very good especially in rural areas and the infrastructure is much better than for many Asian countries.' A women's health volunteer programme in the poor suburbs of southern Tehran has so far produced good results and is to be extended. Under the programme, women volunteers act as family planning counsellors in areas which are not served by the primary healthcare network. Iran has a relatively high literacy rate of 74 per cent and girls' enrolment in primary school is nearly as high as that of boys. The spread of education and literacy has increased a widespread desire for smaller families. Despite the success of the programme to date, the UNFPA says the tasks ahead are still 'formidable'. A relatively large number of Iranians, born in the baby-boom of 1976-1986 will be of child-bearing age from 1996 onwards, so fertility rates will increase. Since 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25, there is a need for even more emphasis to be placed on education.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- POPULATION IN IRAN  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population:                           1994                     63.2m                                       2025                    144.6m Average growth 1990-95                                          2.7% Urban population 1992                                            58% Fertility rate/woman   1990-95                                   6.0 Adult literacy 1990:                  male                       65%                                       female                     43% Family planning users   1975-93                                  65% GNP per capita 1991                                    Dollars 2,170 Share of central govt spending 1991 on:          education                                             20.9%             health                                              7.9%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UNFPA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
19940927000000000	FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (3): Later retirement with smaller pensions - Eva Kaluzynska examines the implications of an ageing population. Europe's workforce is ageing - 15 per cent of the population is already aged 65 or over, compared with an average of 6 per cent in the rest of the world. 'We're moving towards the low 20s (%) at the turn of the century,' said Dr David Coleman, a demographer at Oxford University, specialising in trends affecting Europe. There are relatively minor variations in birth and death rates among the 17 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), but the picture is very clear. Any company considering relocation will obviously factor in current levels of social costs, lowest in Portugal, Greece, Spain and the UK; highest in Germany, Denmark and Belgium. But employers must tune into demographic trends now if they want to get a sustainable, long-term personnel policy off the ground. 'Companies may be thinking of moving now to a country where costs are low, but they must plan now to keep them low,' said employee-benefits specialist David Formosa, of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes. The baby boom after the war was followed by what demographers at Eurostat, in Luxembourg, call a 'baby bust' in the 1970s. A marked decline in natural population growth throughout the EEA is continuing, while the death rate remains stable. In 1993, the birth rate was 11.2 per thousand, down from 11.5 per thousand in 1992; while the death rate stayed at 10.1 per thousand. Women, currently 51.2 per cent of the population in the European Union (EU), are having fewer children, and they are having them later if at all. Only in Ireland (and Poland, in central Europe) are women still having two or more children each. In 1993, there were 4.19m births in the 17 countries of the EEA - 110,000 fewer than the previous year. Demographers are ringing alarm bells about the need to adjust policies now, both at company and government level. 'Germany is the forerunner,' said Harri Cruijsen, team leader at Eurostat's project on demography. 'In the next five to 10 years it is going to have the most acute problems in adjusting to an ageing workforce.' Italy and Spain lag by about five to 10 years. The situation is less serious in France, which has had a policy of financial incentives for would-be mothers. The UK could also buck the trend up to a point, due to what Cruijsen calls an abnormally high rate of teenage pregnancies not seen elsewhere in Europe. The overall implications are stark. Employers who stay on the continent, rather than move nearer to markets in Asia, must make the most of the existing pool of potential labour, given the lack of youngsters. Experts agree on the need for two significant shifts in policy and attitude: postponing the age of retirement, and recruiting more women into the labour force. 'Seniors will stay on, females will come on,' as Cruijsen puts it. Many employees able to do so have retired early over the past decade, and many still expect to do so. 'This will stop,' said Cruijsen bluntly. Italy and Japan are already planning to raise the statutory age of retirement, and other countries will follow suit, experts say. 'The notion of early retirement has overshot its usefulness,' said Coleman. 'Active, employable life is getting longer. The notion that a person is old and past it at 65 is increasingly obsolete.' The idea of older people giving up their places in the workforce to youngsters gathered favour during the recession, though without any significant effect in reducing unemployment. Employers encouraged the trend, rejuvenating their workforces in the belief that younger people adapted better to new technologies. But Formosa urges managers to be innovative in adapting to new realities: 'Employers will have to start thinking differently.' Replacing key staff who have specialised knowledge and experience will become far more difficult, and flexible solutions, such as part-time schemes for key older employees could be part of the answer. He would recommend phased retirement: 'Maybe people will still be doing one or two days a week when they're aged 70.' Employers casting round for reserves in the labour force will have to make better use of women, experts say. Women currently make up about 40 per cent of the labour force in the EU. Denmark has the highest rate of female participation, at 46.6 per cent, followed by France (44.3), Portugal (43.2) and the UK(43.2). Ireland has the lowest rate, at 34.1 per cent. 'All projections for modest growth in the labour force at the turn of the century come from increased levels of female participation,' says Coleman. Formosa thinks employers will come round to offering women with caring responsibilities for children or older people more flexible working arrangements, as they realise the value of doing so. 'I believe employers will make more of an effort to keep women, as there is more difficulty in finding replacements.' Coleman estimates that, if all EU countries matched Denmark's rate of female participation in the labour force, the recruits would more than make up for any shortfall. 'There is a hidden labour force of at least 30m, which will be mobilised as married women increasingly take up work or return to work.' Europe's ageing workforce can expect lower statutory pensions, with higher retirement ages as the ratio of taxpayers to recipients descends from the current 2.4:1 to under two. Incentives to retire early will go, and the prospect of lower incomes will oblige seniors to work on. Employers are likely to become involved in improving pension provisions, partly through helping employees to set up appropriate schemes to which they are the main contributors, partly through incentives for later retirement. Formosa says there is still time to avoid scenarios in which pensions systems collapse under the burden of payments due. Later retirement will cut the cost of pensions by reducing the duration of payments. Some experts have suggested migration as a potential solution to the imbalance in western Europe's age structure. Coleman is adamant that this is no quick fix. The EEA countries cannot absorb significant numbers of legal migrants, other than those with specific skills for specific periods, he says: 'It seems eccentric to propose immigration for low-grade labour, especially since future demand emphasises high skills.' Importing cheap young labour would exacerbate one of Europe's biggest problems, its low productivity. Coleman argues that western Europe must deal with the impending crisis through making the best use of its own resources. It should, he says, retrain to reduce unemployment and invest in more capital-intensive processes to improve productivity. And it should mobilise more of its potential working population by making it easier for women to work, as well as by recruiting those beyond current retirement age. Canny employers can start planning now.
19940818000000000	FT  18 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Controlling population. Two stories are told in the annual report from the United Nations population fund, published yesterday. The first is one of success: in the past 40 years the rate of growth of the world's population has slowed sharply. The second  -about prospects for the future - is less cheerful. Nevertheless, the evidence shows neither that population growth is the overwhelming problem it is so often alleged to be, nor that policy is helpless to lower it, even in poor countries. What is required is no more - but also no less - than to help people, particularly women, achieve the families they themselves desire. The most encouraging feature of past experience is that, contrary to the once cherished theories of demographers, declines in the rate of population growth have occurred even in countries that have seen little economic growth. Education of women has helped. But much of the fall can be attributed to better distribution of contraception, argues the UN. One of the clearest messages of the report is that people will willingly use contraception, if it is made available. The UN's story about the prospects for coming decades is somewhat more disturbing. The number of people on the planet is likely almost to double, from the present 5.7bn to some 10bn, by the middle of next century. This assumes that birth rates continue to fall; other assumptions suggest figures between 8bn and 12.5bn. Food supplies Yet such increases need be no disaster. The UN report rightly rebuts fears of a global food shortage, of the kind voiced by the Club of Rome two decades ago. But uneven distribution of the world's food supplies leaves people in many regions facing starvation. More even than food, water may become a cause of conflict. It also warns that pressure on other natural resources - forests, seas and the atmosphere - will increase. Yet it is important to recognise that population growth is not the sole cause of pressure on resources. Nor would even a stable global population halt it. Economic growth is still more important. That is why the 15 per cent of the world's population in rich countries consumes so disproportionate a share of global resources. It is also why calls from this minority for limits on the numbers of the poor majority look morally disreputable. Neither prophecies of doom nor hypocritical bombast are justified. What is needed, instead, is for developing countries themselves to recognise that unchecked population growth imposes, at best, a heavy burden of additional investment upon them. At worst, it threatens their social stability, as people flood from the countryside to the cities, in search of jobs. Family planning These pressing social and economic issues underline the importance of next month's conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting on population for a decade. The UN's draft agenda calls for co-ordination of measures to stabilise the world's population, including a trebling of spending on family planning programmes, and better education for women. This is the right policy agenda, because it emphasises helping people help themselves. This is not just the most ethical, but also the most practical way to address the issue, since what people want for themselves is also what their societies need. Despite the convergence of support for such measures among governments, the agenda faces opposition. This month the Vatican, which has called on governments to boycott the conference, accused the UN of promoting abortion. That charge is ill-founded, given that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is barred from portraying abortion as a way to control family size. It would be both inhumane and imprudent for governments to reject the UN's draft agenda. That is not to make light of the social and cultural implications of the policies recommended by the UNFPA. But it is surely right for women to be given control over the number of children they bear. Western countries should assist countries that wish to make contraception available, though not those that resort to coercion. They should also remind recalcitrant governments that the alternative to contraception is both lower growth in incomes per head and serious social disruption.
19940818000000000	FT  18 AUG 94 / UN warns of world's creaking cradle: Annual population report points to huge strains on resources. The world's population is set to reach a staggering 10bn by the middle of the next century, up from 5.7bn now, the United Nations warned yesterday. The annual report from the UN's Population Fund (UNFPA), released yesterday, says the projections assume that the average number of children born to each woman will continue to fall, as it has done steadily for several decades (see accompanying story). If birth rates fall by more it expects the world's population may be as low as 7.8bn people in 2050. If they stop falling, the total could reach 12.5bn. The difference between the upper and lower projections - nearly 5bn people, as much as the world's current population - has huge implications for prosperity, migration and demand for natural resources. But in advance of a UN conference in Cairo next month, controversy is mounting over how countries can try to restrain population growth, or whether they should do so at all. Global figures conceal the diverging fortunes of different regions. Africa's population growth of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world, easily outstripping Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, the report says. Although many developing countries have seen steady falls in total fertility rates - the average number of children born to each woman - they have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40 years from 41 years to 61 years, according to the UNFPA. Industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's population to shrink given their slow rates of population growth: about 1 per cent a year in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the UNFPA expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025. The report flags a long list of economic, social and environmental concerns that follow from its projections. It warns that population growth will put huge strains on the supply of natural resources such as forests, fish and clean air. It dismisses fears of an 'overall global shortage of food' of the kind much voiced by 'Club of Rome' school of forecasters some 20 years ago, pointing out that 'during the past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth'. But the report points out that the improvement in food production has been unevenly distributed; in Africa during the past decade, food production fell by 5 per cent while population rose by a third. The report concludes that while production 'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable future . . . poverty translates global adequacy into national and local shortages'. Water, as much as food, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between countries and regions, the UN suggests. Rapidly industrialising countries such as China are facing intense demand for water supplies from industry as well as from rural populations which are continuing to grow. Developing countries should brace themselves for huge internal migration as surplus rural labour travels to the towns to look for work, the UN warns. The report estimates that 1.3bn will be added to the workforces of Asia, Africa and Latin America between 1995 and 2020. It adds that cities are likely to contain half the world's population by the end of the century. For their part, developed countries need to consider how to respond to rising pressure for immigration, particularly along Europe's and North America's southern borders. The UN describes present levels of international migration as 'hardly significant numerically - about a million people a year  -compared with movement within countries toward urban areas'. But it warns that such migration has 'a social and economic impact out of proportion to its numbers'.

19940812000000000	FT  12 AUG 94 / Children neither seen nor heard: A steep fall in the birth rate means demographic worries for east Germany. The British author, PD James, recently wrote a novel called The Children of Men. It is set in England in 2021 and describes how infertility has spread like a plague. The human race faces extinction as scientists try to reverse the trend. At the end of the book, a woman gives birth, but whether this is enough to save the human race is left open. German demographers and doctors could identity with this work of fiction: five years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the birth rate in east Germany continues to plummet. Mr Horst Halle, head of the maternity department at the Charite, east Berlin's largest hospital, first noticed the trend in early 1990. 'You just had to look at the statistics,' he explained. 'Before 1989, there were about 16,000 babies born each year in east Berlin. Today, that figure has slumped to 6,800, a decline of about 60 per cent. 'In the Charite itself, we used to record about 2,200 births a year. Today, we have fewer than 1,800, and we are doing better than most maternity hospitals in east Berlin.' Such an unprecedented fall in the birth rate would have shocked the former communist regime in East Germany. It prided itself on its wide range of social services aimed at providing women with excellent childcare facilities to encourage them to have children. Then, day-care centres were free. Women could take a year's paid maternity leave and return to a guaranteed job, or take off three years with generous state support and still have the same job to go back to. Indeed, more than 90 per cent of the female working population were employed, compared with 49 per cent in west Germany. By the age of 21, east German women started having children, unlike their west German counterparts, who generally started a family in their mid-to-late 20s. Despite these incentives, however, the birth rate in east Germany was relatively low compared with most other east European countries under the communists. Mr Jurgen Dorbritz, a demographer at the Federal Statistics Office, says: 'What we are now seeing in eastern Germany is a birth rate which is falling from a low base. That is the worrying aspect. That's what makes the statistics so extraordinary.' In 1989, there were 198,922 live births in east Germany, the equivalent of 12 births per 1,000, or about 1.6 children per family. This was the same as in west Germany. By 1993, the number of east German births had fallen to 79,926 - or about 60 per cent of the 1989 rate - the equivalent of 0.8 children per family, or only half the west German level. 'We just don't know how long this trend will continue. One thing is certain. There will be very few children born between the years 2015 and 2020 because of the lack of women of child-bearing age. Can you imagine how difficult it is going to be to pay for the number of old people in our country?' said Mr Dorbritz. According to the latest statistics from the German Association for Pension Insurance, the number of people under the age of 20 in east Germany will fall from 3.84m in 1993 to 2.6m in 2020; the number of people aged between 20 and 60 will fall from 8.7m to 7.6m; and those over 60 will rise from 3m to 4.13m. The percentage of pensioners per 100 contributors to the state pension insurance system will rise from 26 per cent in 1993 to more than 50 per cent by 2020. Mr Halle, who has worked in the Charite for 28 years, believes there are several reasons why east German women are remaining childless. 'Demographers tend to ignore the fact that we had been expecting a sharp fall in the birth rate in the year 1995, regardless of unification. This is because the east German abortion law of 1972 made abortion available on demand. We knew we were not going to have many child-bearing women in the mid-1990s,' he explained. In 1972, the birth rate fell to about 6 per 1,000, climbing back to about 12 births per 1,000. Today it is fewer than 5.1. But Mr Halle also believes that the process of German unification itself has had a profound social effect on east German women. 'A young east German woman knows that if she becomes pregnant, the chances she will find a job are now far less, especially given the high level of unemployment,' he said. East German women have borne the brunt of unemployment, which is officially 16 per cent of the working population, excluding those on short-time work, early retirement schemes, or job creation programmes. By the end of the first quarter of this year, more than 790,000 east German women had lost their jobs, representing a female unemployment rate of 23 per cent. In west Germany, 1.1m women, or 9.3 per cent, are out of work. 'East German women today have freedom of choice, but they have lost their status in society,' said Mr Dorbritz. The other pressure arising from unification is that many east German women have had to seek new qualifications, retrain, or change jobs more often, unlike the former days when a job was for life. 'There is no more security. The widespread sense of uncertainty has played a major role in the decline of the birth rate,' said Mr Dorbritz. The freedom to travel has played its part in the decline of the birth rate as well: young east German women have an unprecedented chance to go abroad before they settle and start a family. 'There was hardly anything else to do before 1989,' said Mr Dorbritz. 'East German society was geared towards encouraging young women to procreate. All those social planks of free kindergartens, both parents in a job, heavily subsidised or free children's clothes and shoes, have now disappeared.' Greater mobility and open borders have led to a sharp rise in migration from east Germany to west Germany. More than 1.2m from a population of 17m east Germans went to live in west Germany between late 1989 and early 1991. 'Many of these people were young and skilled,' said Mr Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. 'Of the overall drop in the birth rate, roughly one-ninth can be attributed to the sheer decline of east Germany's population during those two years.' Staff at the Charite hospital know that, unless the birth rate increases, the obstetricians, doctors and nurses could be without a job. 'We have 2,000 beds here,' said Mr Halle. 'Before unification, we were dealing with more than 2,200 women a year. If we cannot account for all the beds, we will be under pressure to make savings. That means cutting jobs.' But his main concern is the kind of society which will evolve in east Germany in the next century. 'The prognosis is very bad,' said Mr Halle. 'I do not know how we are going to fend for the elderly. Who is going to pay for them?' One answer might be to allow immigrants into the country under a quota system to replenish the population - a solution advanced by some liberals. One thing is clear. Mr Eberstadt believes that, if the present trends in east Germany continue, it will be virtually impossible for what he calls 'generational replacement' to occur. 'For generational replacement, eastern Germany's women of child-bearing age today would have to give birth to an average of about 2.07 infants over the course of their lives. They are now having 0.8 children, less than one birth per woman per lifetime. This is not enough for a net population replacement.'
19941215000000000	FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (13): Women find their role - A transformation in Tunisia's business scene. Many Tunisians regard a group of laws which, in 1956, abolished polygamy and gave their womenfolk rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world, as one of their country's proudest achievements. The 'Personal Status Code' is arguably former President Habib Bourguiba's greatest single achievement. The rights granted to Tunisian women have been further consolidated since Mr Zine El Abidine Ben Ali became president in 1987. The efforts to promote education, health and family planning have produced clearly visible results - population growth is down to 1.9 per cent a year and two-thirds of all Tunisian women are now literate. Furthermore, women are increasingly visible in a wide variety of professions - in teaching, medicine, architecture and in factories as workers, engineers and managers. Today, women have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of jobs in industry and 40 per cent in agriculture. Increasingly, they own and manage new businesses. A minor revolution is afoot as the number of new companies founded by women in Tunisia has risen from 7 per cent of the total in 1985 to 13 per cent this year. Most of these companies are small, with less than 10 employees, but others are much larger and often engage in international trade in a manner which was quite unthinkable only a decade ago. It does not come as a surprise that 73 per cent of all companies owned by women are found in the textile sector. That is true in other developing countries but the quality of some of what is produced in this sector and the sheer size of some investments points to change. Leila Boufaid, whose husband is a senior magistrate, started a small luxury braid business 20 years ago. Today, she employs 200 workers, has a turnover of Dollars 1.8m. Around 90 per cent of its output is exported to Europe and the US. Maille Fil which opened in 1989 is a Dollars 20m investment by Hedi Bouchamaoui for his four daughters, two of whom manage Tunisia's largest combed cotton and yarn production plant. The company imports cotton from the US and produces 3,000 tons of high quality fabric a year, 75 per cent of which is exported. While two daughters oversee the factory, the others are completing their studies at university in Michigan. Meanwhile, women in Tunisia are now branching out into other spheres of business. Saida Mechri worked in a security company after gaining a degree in economics in Belgium. In 1988 she started her own company, Securitap, which employs 800 people, 700 of whom are security agents hired out to embassies and companies across the country and boasting an annual turnover of Dollars 1.7m. More recently she started a haute couture business which employs 10 designers and sells styles to Italy. She readily confesses that the company, called Tosca, is her 'true love.' There are other diverse examples of successful women in business. Hayet Laouani, for instance, started as secretary in a shipping company, 20 years ago. Now she owns and runs Stumar, a company with a turnover of Dollars 3m and is active in stevadoring, conveyancing and forwarding. Rashida Rouissi is a leading exporter of citrus products and is doing battle with the Marseilles suppliers who have a tight grip on the bulk of Tunisian exports, especially citrus fruit, 89 per cent of which was, until recently, shipped through the French port. Ms Rouissi has, however, succeeded in exporting ever-larger quantities of citrus fruit through Toulon, thus cutting freight and other costs. Her battle is not merely with Marseilles shippers but with well-established Tunisians who have lived comfortably off their links with the French port. Alya Heda runs Opalia, a joint venture with an Italian businessman which makes pharmaceutical products under licence from Alfa Wasserman and Amuchina of Italy. Among the hundred doctors and pharmacists who work for her, eighty are women. Pharmaceutical exports to African countries are flourishing and she hopes soon to break into the European market. Selma Rekik is the financial controller of the Chebika Group, owned by her father and brothers. Among the group's key activities is the manufacture of electrical items for cars - Peugeot, Renault, Mercedes and Opel are clients. She has recently acquired a 40-year lease on a former state farm, the Stifen domaine, north-east of Tunis and is busy developing rich farmland where earlier lack of investment over a generation all but ended production. All the fruit and vegetables produced will be exported to Europe. Like other women entrepreneurs, she started in business after marrying and raising children; her husband is one of Tunisia's leading ophthalmists. A study conducted last year by Aziza Dargouth, who runs the CPS consulting agency, suggests that 48 per cent of women who start their own business find little difficulty in reconciling their professional and family obligations, that 43 per cent ventured into such activities for the sake of the challenge it offered, that only one husband in five is opposed to his wife's activities. Such findings do not conform to a widespread European stereotype of Arab women. This new breed of innovative women owner-managers work hard, often more diligently than menfolk and is prepared to do battle with the civil service which, despite the efforts to liberalise the management of the economy launched in 1986, remains a worthy successor of its Turkish and French forebears. A Tunisian businesswoman jokes that edicts of the central bank are 'as difficult to interpret as the Holy Koran itself . . . and spawn quite as many hadiths (the body of comments on the Koran).' Such rules, in her view, should be clearly written and implemented with speed and honesty. Though some women run large companies, the bulk of such businesses employ 10 people or less and are often run from home.
19890205000000000	SINGAPORE OFFICIALS FEAR POPULATION PLUNGE IN CHINESE ZODIAC'S YEAR OF THE SNAKE. With the Year of the Snake approaching with the lunar new year, officials worried about a population plunge are emphasizing that many of history's finest were born under the sign of the slithery reptile. "Snakes make great people," pleads Health Minister Yeo Cheow Tong to Chinese couples reluctant to start a family in a less than auspicious astrological period. Hospitals that brimmed over with babies during the outgoing Dragon year -- with its portents of wealth and prosperity -- are preparing for empty beds in Snake year. Stores are stocking less maternity and infant clothing. For 1,000 years Chinese astrology has revolved around 12 mythical or real animals, each conveying personality and character traits to those born within its 12-month cycle. Depending upon the year of birth, a newborn is either an ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat or sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, pig or rat. The snake ranks among the least desirable. Snake babies are thought to produce adults equated with double-dealing, scandal and disreputable behavior. "Many still believe the zodiac is not a bunch of mumbo jumbo," said Paul Wee, who would like to become a father but perhaps not in the Year of the Snake. During the last Year of the Snake in 1977, births declined by 12%. "There are great people born under every one of the zodiac signs," said Yeo, whose population planners fear that a badly needed baby boom is about to fizzle. "The world would be a sadder and poorer place if the capable were born only once every 12 years." He said snake babies include U.S. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln, the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. Singapore needs five years matching 1988's 50,000 births to reverse a shrinking population. If a lower birth rate resumes, officials predict that the current population of 2.6 million will start shrinking precariously in the year 2010 and nose-dive thereafter. "We must change our thinking," said Yeo. "We should not consider the other zodiac signs as being less favorable than the dragon." So elaborate ceremonies welcoming snake year were planned for the start of the lunar new year on Monday, Feb. 6. The Singapore River is to be transformed into a carnival with fireworks and giant lotus flowers spraying colorful water jets. There will be a display of 600 snakes, including such rarities as the white cobra, double-headed versions, gold-ringed, bamboo and water species. Government matchmakers touting the joys of matrimony and progeny are stressing the positive aspects of the snake personality. Susan Chan, deputy director of the Social Development Unit, said snake types often make their way to the top, ensure that they are in the right place at the right time and demonstrate an aptitude for research and academics. "We're just going to forge ahead in our programs" encouraging singles to marry and start families, Chan said.
19900211000000000	HIGH BIRTH RATE THREATENS TO WIPE OUT AFRICA'S MODEST GAINS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH. Elizabeth Mazivire, a 16-year-old mother of three, works in the tobacco barn of a wealthy Zimbabwean farmer to supplement the earnings of her tractor-driver husband. Her eldest son, Peter, is only 4 years old. Weary, and looking far older than her age, Elizabeth says she "accidentally fell pregnant" at 12 and since then has continued having accidental pregnancies by her 20-year-old husband, Jonathan. She is one of thousands of Zimbabwean women who, either because they do not know about contraceptives or have no access to them, end up having more children than planned. Zimbabwe, with only 9 million people in a country the size of France, hardly ranks as overcrowded. But here, as almost everywhere in Africa, a high birth rate is threatening to wipe out modest gains from economic growth. Zimbabwe and neighboring Botswana have been spotlighted by the World Bank as the only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa where vigorous government efforts to promote family planning are starting to show results. About 40% of Zimbabwean couples now use contraceptives -- about 10 times the African average, according to the World Bank. Only Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island not typical of Africa, scores higher, with 78%. Even so, Zimbabwe is still fighting an uphill battle against the African tradition of large families. Between 1980 and 1987 the net population growth was 3.7%, although the latest figures show a drop to 2.9%. World Bank statistics show that as recently as 1988, the average Zimbabwean woman could expect to give birth to five children in her lifetime. Population growth has far outpaced Zimbabwe's annual average economic growth rate of 2.4% since independence in 1980, according to World Bank statistics. This has led to an average drop in the per capita gross domestic product of 1.3% a year, with falling living standards, growing unemployment and increased pressure on social services. In much of Africa the figures are far worse. World Bank projections foresee a doubling of the continent's population to 1 billion in the next 30 years, and at the moment only 3% to 4% of couples use contraception. In Zimbabwe accidental pregnancies are most prevalent among schoolgirls who, for moral reasons, are barred by the authorities from freely obtaining contraceptives like their married and adult counterparts. But teen-agers and couples who do not use any form of modern contraception for cultural, religious and other reasons are now the main targets of a state-backed family planning program. The Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council has expanded its activities since independence to almost every town and has established a rural network in which contraceptives are given freely to couples and unmarried adults. "We are the nerve center of the country's population control strategy," said a spokeswoman of the council, which gets 70% of its funds from the government. The council holds lectures for couples on why and how to space their children and counseling sessions for young people on the consequences of early marriage. However, the campaign to persuade families to have fewer children has yet to reach every corner of the country, particularly isolated rural areas where 80% of Zimbabwe's population lives. Elizabeth, for example, despite living on a farm only 40 miles from the capital, said she had never heard of contraceptives until "a few weeks ago, when I went to Harare for specialized medical treatment." "I wish I knew there was this (contraceptives) and I think I couldn't have fallen pregnant in the first place and I could have been in school now," she said with a wry smile. Rural families, who rely on children to work on their farms, have an average of eight children. Before the advent of modern medical care, infant mortality encouraged women to have a large number of pregnancies to ensure that several children survived.
19900415000000000	PLANET WORSE OFF SINCE FIRST EARTH DAY IN 1970; ENVIRONMENT: GAINS HAVE BEEN MADE IN 20 YEARS BUT WORLD'S PROBLEMS NOW ARE POTENTIALLY MORE DEVASTATING.. In the 20 years since the first Earth Day, nature has proved itself to be surprisingly resilient. Witness the comeback of the American bald eagle after the banning of the pesticide DDT or the cleaning of the once-inflamed Cuyahoga River in Ohio. But the progress the world will celebrate next Sunday on Earth Day 1990 has brought little respite. New, potentially more devastating threats to the environment have emerged, forcing the world to recast its environmental agenda for the remainder of the 20th Century. Whereas the environmental movement 20 years ago worried about an individual dam or a single highway, the world today is facing the loss of its tropical forests and the extinction of half of its species within the next few decades, as well as a potential warming trend that could forever change the climate of the planet. "In 1970, we were accelerating as we headed toward the cliff," said Carl Pope, conservation director of the Sierra Club. "We applied the brakes during those 20 years and now we're maybe half-way there." New controls on vehicle emissions have improved air quality over many cities, including Los Angeles, but the very fabric of the atmosphere is shredding because of an ozone-destroying pollutant not even recognized two decades ago. Lake Erie, which was so polluted by sewage in 1970 that many conservationists considered it "dead," has been cleaned up and now has a $600-million fishery. But not far away, Lake Michigan is believed to be so contaminated by airborne pollutants and industrial chemicals that some conservationists say women of child-bearing age should not eat its fish. Even though the nation today has far more legally designated wilderness areas than it had two decades ago, there is far less actual wilderness. Lands that were spared the rush of development by government protections instead are being ravaged by acid rain produced by burning coal. "By every major environmental indicator, the Earth is worse off today than it was in 1970," said Lester R. Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmental organization. Just as many of today's environmental problems differ from those of 1970, so do the recipes for resolving them. There is more emphasis on preventive measures. Instead of focusing on saving a single bird or plant species, the conservation movement has turned toward saving lands that contain a diversity of wildlife. Instead of just asking for more smog-control equipment, conservationists are pushing for alternative-fuel vehicles, new strategies for getting people out of their cars as well as energy-efficient buildings and industry. Instead of requiring that contaminants be cleaned up after industry has disposed of them, the push now is to find alternatives in the industrial process. Instead of just urging people to recycle, the nation's conservationists want less waste to be generated in the first place. The fight against global environmental threats also has spawned a flood of proposed remedies, but they require a will to act not yet demonstrated by much of the world. If the planet is to save its tropical forests, repair the ozone layer and head off global warming, industrialization may have to be slowed in developing countries and their economies altered. Industrialized nations will have to find substitutes for fossil fuels and ozone-depleting chemicals and improve their energy efficiency. The challenge is mind-boggling. "We're looking at putting on the brakes on population growth . . . phasing out fossil fuels, reversing the deforestation of the Earth," said Brown of Worldwatch. "Any one of these things would thoroughly challenge any generation in history. We've got a half dozen of them. We've got to do all at once." Many of these global threats went unrecognized on April 22, 1970, when the environment first was celebrated in a kind of national teach-in called Earth Day and the nation awoke like a latter-day Rip van Winkle to discover that pollution was rampant and getting worse. For the rest of that decade, America saw unrivaled environmental action. In short order, President Richard M. Nixon opened the doors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Congress passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the disposal of hazardous wastes. Much of this occurred in a presidency not sympathetic to environmental concerns. William D. Ruckelshaus, whom Nixon appointed to head the new EPA, said in a recent interview that his former boss considered the environment unimportant, never seemed curious about it and traced environmental activism to a "softness" in Americans. "I had several conversations with him," said Ruckelshaus, now an executive with a waste management company. "He never once asked me, 'Is anything wrong here' (with the environment)?" But public pressure to take action was strong and many of the reforms launched under Nixon produced results. Dramatic progress was made in cleaning surface water. San Francisco Bay, for example, is far cleaner today than it was 20 years ago. So is the Potomac River. "The Potomac stunk to high heavens in the summertime," recalled Brent Blackwelder, chairman of the board of the League of Conservation Voters, who grew up in Washington. "It was so foul you wouldn't want to get near it. Now it's a beautiful river." Air quality also improved in the densest urban settings. Although the pace of growth in some cities overcame the benefits rendered by smog-control technology, "air quality in this country would be a disaster" today without the Clean Air Act, said Rafe Pomerance, senior associate of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank in Washington. Perhaps the two most successful single strokes by policy-makers and conservationists were the banning of DDT and the phasing out of lead in gasoline in the early 1970s. DDT causes birds to lay eggs with shells so thin they break before hatching. Lead exposure in children can permanently impair their intellectual abilities. With the phasing out of those contaminants, endangered birds began to reproduce and lead levels in the blood of average Americans dropped substantially. "One thing we discovered was that when we did something bold, nature bounded back better than we had anticipated," Pope said. "When we have taken half-measures, the system hasn't responded." One of the "half-measures" cited by Pope was the Endangered Species Act, which protects wildlife only after it is already dangerously close to extinction. The bald eagle is multiplying and the once imperiled American alligator has been taken off the endangered list. Unfortunately, such success stories are rare. Many species on the federal list continue to decline in number, and others, such as the dusky seaside sparrow, already have become extinct. But whatever their individual failings, the environmental laws of the 1970s represented the traditional American impulse to preserve, to leave the land better than it was found. The 1980s showed yet another side of the American character, the fervor to push back the frontiers, to exploit seemingly inexhaustible resources. Some environmental activists now dismiss the 1980s as "the lost decade," a time of missed opportunity. Environmental research, from the testing of pesticides to the development of non-polluting energy sources, significantly slowed. Former President Ronald Reagan, who was not an advocate of environmental regulation, is largely blamed for attempts to unravel, or at least ignore, laws put on the books in the previous decade. Early in his first Administration, Reagan tended to put "marginally competent" administrators in the EPA and other agencies that "he didn't care that much about," said Ruckelshaus, whom Reagan brought in to reform the EPA after the President's first choice resigned in scandal. Reagan gave the environmental movement "the back of the hand," infuriating environmentalists by treating them with indifference, Ruckelshaus said. Even so, Reagan had a curiosity about the environment. "(Reagan actually) was more interested in the environment than Nixon," the former administrator said. "He often would ask me . . . about the science of it. He wanted to know if there was any substance to it." Despite Reagan's poor environmental record, some progress was made during his years. The Food Security Act of 1985 allowed for the recycling of land, the conversion of as many as 40 million acres of cropland -- about 11% of the nation's total -- into grasslands or woods. Conservationists say much of this land should never have been plowed and, without the law, it might have turned to wasteland. The law already is credited with reducing erosion by one-third. In areas where government failed to act, consumers did. After a report last year about the possible health hazards of Alar, a chemical used to improve the appearance and prolong the shelf life of apples, the nation's consumers began demanding pesticide-free produce at their markets. Public anxiety about the thinning ozone layer also prompted many corporations to phase out voluntarily their use of some ozone-destroying chemicals. Other companies are starting to promote their products based on their conservation merits. The H. J. Heinz Co., for instance, recently publicized the production of a new plastic ketchup bottle that can be more easily recycled than most plastics. Market forces may even make recycling a permanent fixture of the American lifestyle. With communities running out of places for dumping rapidly proliferating waste and with disposal costs escalating, more and more cities are launching curbside recycling programs. Legislatures have passed laws requiring deposits on bottle purchases and other recyclable goods. California will require communities to reduce garbage by 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000, primarily through recycling, composting and reducing the sources of waste. Corporations may be prodded into further environmental action under a proposal by environmental activists to award "green seals" of approval to products that meet certain conservation criteria. The seals could be given for anything from an energy-efficient manufacturing process to packaging that can be recycled. Although the nation has come up with answers to some of its environmental ills, there are no such easy fixes for combatting global threats like overpopulation and deforestation. When Paul Ehrlich warned of an overpopulation disaster in his 1968 book, "The Population Bomb," there were 3.5 billion people on Earth. Today, there are 5.2 billion and the number is growing. Efforts to reverse the upward trend have succeeded in some countries. Fourteen European countries, with about 5% of the world's population, have reached zero population growth and Japan, France and Finland are among others headed in that direction. Population growth fell by half in Japan from 1948 to 1955 and in China from 1970 to 1976. But if death rates do not rise worldwide, birth rates will have to be reduced 62% to stabilize the planet's population, according to Brown of Worldwatch. The populations of India, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Mexico are expected to double or even triple before they flatten out late in the next century, he said. "The real question is whether we check population growth or nature checks population growth," Brown said. "If we don't, nature will." Population pressures have contributed to the loss of the world's forests and the rise in gases blamed for the greenhouse effect. Forests shield a diversity of wildlife and absorb gases that otherwise trap heat in the atmosphere much like the panes of a greenhouse. If the greenhouse effect is not checked, sea levels could rise, droughts and hurricanes could multiply and more forests could vanish. Progress in persuading Third World countries to conserve their forests has been scant, although Brazil recently responded to international pressure by removing tax subsidies for forest clearing. Attempts are being made to reforest, but South Korea remains the only Third World country to do it successfully. Some industrialized countries, including Australia and the United States, have launched tree-planting programs. Even if the forests are spared and more trees planted, global warming still could be accelerated by burning such fossil fuels as oil and coal. Most scientists agree that slowing down climate change will require a major shift from the world's dependence on fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases, to less polluting solar, geothermal and other alternatives. Although international discussions to curb greenhouse gases are under way, some conservationists concede that sweeping actions may not be embraced until there is a greater scientific consensus on how soon the Earth's climate may change. The phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, chemicals used in refrigeration and in a variety of industrial processes, will ease the greenhouse threat as well as protect the ozone layer. Although industrialized countries have pledged to curtail or even eliminate their use, some developing countries are planning to raise production on a scale that would offset the progress. "I think we've lost a great deal," said David Brower, a pre-eminent conservationist who once helped lead the Sierra Club and later founded Friends of the Earth and the Earth Island Institute, a nonprofit environmental group. "We're far worse off than we were in the '70s," Brower said. "Since 1912, we've used four times as many resources as in all previous history, and that can't continue." Brower and other conservationists are pushing for wholesale changes over the next two decades that normally would evolve over several generations. Recognizing that worldwide cooperation is essential, the organizers of Earth Day 1990 have enlisted the participation of 140 countries in this week's activities. "History would teach you to be pretty pessimistic because people don't change fast," the Sierra Club's Pope said. "But if you look at Eastern Europe over the past year -- sometimes they do."

19900511000000000	POPE GOES BARNSTORMING WITH BIRTH CONTROL PLEA; MEXICO: HE DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE IN A COUNTRY WHOSE GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY SEEKS TO LIMIT POPULATION GROWTH.. A tireless Pope John Paul II barnstormed through bruising heat and buoying crowds in the Mexican north Thursday to deliver an uncompromising message against artificial birth control to a nation whose government aggressively seeks to limit population growth. John Paul spent three hours in Chihuahua, enough time for 600 new babies to be born in Mexico where the population, now around 83 million, has grown by about 16 million since the Pope's first Mexican visit in 1979. Pilgrims from El Paso, Tex., 225 miles to the north, joined hundreds of thousands of festive Mexicans at a wind-whipped outdoor service in a dusty field here in Chihuahua, an agricultural and mining state of copper-colored hills, endless blue sky and wide-brimmed cowboy hats beneath an unblinking summer sun. An afternoon Mass in a dry riverbed at industrial Monterrey took John Paul to within 100 miles of Laredo, Tex., his closest stop to the United States on an eight-day Mexican pilgrimage that ends Sunday. Once again Thursday -- Mother's Day in Mexico -- huge friendly crowds stalked John Paul's every step through a day that began early in Durango and ended late in Mexico City. In a modern society scarred by "violence, abortion, euthanasia, the marginalization of the disabled and the poor," John Paul said, it is the woman who "is called to keep alive the spark of life, the respect for the mystery of all new life." Terming Catholic marriage a "demanding reality," the Pope said that Roman Catholic couples must always be open "to the gift of life." "You must keep in mind that if the possibility of conceiving a child is artificially eliminated in a marriage, the couple is shutting itself off from God and opposing his will," the Pope said in reiterating the church's unbending opposition to artificial birth control. "Furthermore," he said, "the husband and wife close themselves off from each other because they reject the mutual gift of fatherhood and motherhood, reducing the conjugal union to an opportunity to satisfy each other's egotism." The church-state split over population policies in Mexico is a variation on a theme that courses through all countries of Catholic Latin America. The church, whose teaching allows only natural methods of family planning, is at odds with a Mexican government whose development efforts are compromised by a mushrooming population. There will be 100 million Mexicans by century's end in a nation struggling to lift living standards for a people whose average annual income is now only around $2,000. Government birth control programs, criticized by Catholic groups, include television ads urging couples to limit themselves to two children. The programs have helped to reduce the population growth rate to 2.4% a year. Even that, though, means about 2 million births per year and -- with about 40% of Mexicans under age 15 -- a doubling of the population in 29 years. About 96% of Mexicans are professed Roman Catholics, but 48% of Mexican women now use contraception, according to International Planned Parenthood. In the United States, about 85% of Catholic couples ignore the church teachings on birth control that the Pope reaffirmed Thursday. Telling Chihuahua worshipers that the health of a society depends on the health of its families, John Paul urged greater respect for the rights of children, including the unborn. "Society is more sensitive every day to the rights of the child," the Pope said. But he warned that any child is nevertheless still a potential victim of a long list of ills, including "the evil of a part of society that makes attempts on his life even before birth through the practice of abortion." Today, the Pope travels to extreme southern Mexico for visits to Chiapas and Tabasco states, where he is expected to address refugee issues.
19890831000000000	SINGAPORE RECRUITING CHINESE STUDENTS IN U.S.; ISLAND HOPES TO TAP INTO SOURCE OF ENGINEERS WHO MAY NOT WANT TO GO HOME. Seizing what it views as a golden recruitment opportunity in the aftermath of China's military crackdown in June, the government of Singapore is eyeing the highly skilled pool of Chinese students in the United States. Singapore faces a shortage of engineers needed by international companies, and officials are hoping some of the students may welcome the chance to work in Singapore, rather than going home when their student visas expire. The Singapore Economic Development Board in Los Angeles, which in 1987 began recruiting engineering graduates from U.S. schools, conducted a recruitment campaign in March that drew about 200 applications, 30 of them from Chinese nationals, said K. K. Chan, director of the board's Los Angeles office. After the June bloodshed in China, the board decided to extend a special invitation to Chinese nationals who will soon graduate from U.S. universities. "Because of the uncertainties in China, we thought maybe they will be interested in working in Singapore," Chan said. "These people who come out (from China) are the cream of the country. I would say it's a good target to aim at." Besides offering good salaries relative to Singapore's cost of living, Singapore will expedite immigration applications for the professional recruits, he said. Seventy-six percent of Singapore residents are of Chinese ancestry, and the development board is hoping that will make the country appealing to Chinese nationals looking for a familiar culture. The government also has been actively recruiting in Hong Kong, hoping to attract professionals there who may be wary of 1997, when Britain's lease expires and the colony is to be returned to China. Although 3.25 million Hong Kong residents hold British passports, Britain has denied them the right to freely emigrate there. After Singapore announced in July a program to recruit up to 100,000 Hong Kong workers, the response was so great that Hong Kong police had to be called in to control unruly crowds of job applicants. Singapore is home to nearly 700 international companies with manufacturing operations and more than 3,200 companies with service operations, creating a constant demand for engineering professionals. While the country's two universities, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological Institute, together graduate close to 1,000 engineers a year, the country still must recruit 200 to 300 overseas engineers to meet the demand, Chan said.  High Salaries Electrical and mechanical engineers are the most sought after, he said. An engineer with a bachelor's degree could expect to be paid about $650 to $900 a month while one with a doctorate could receive between $1,500 to $2,000 -- salaries that would guarantee extremely comfortable life styles given Singapore's cost of living, Chan said. (In Singapore, the average salary for beginning production workers such as assemblers and mechanics is $236 a month, according to 1988 statistics from the Singapore Ministry of Labor. The average for beginning technicians is $300 a month.) The island republic previously only granted permanent residence to college graduates, professionals or business people with capital of at least $500,000. It is now recruiting any candidate with a secondary education and five years of work experience. Singapore's recent "two is enough" family planning campaign "has been too successful," Chan said, explaining why the population growth rate has slowed in the country of 2.6 million people. The government is now offering tax benefits to couples who have a third child, he said.  Deadline Over The government's open invitation to overseas workers is worrying some Singapore residents, however, who say the tiny nation is already battling traffic and housing problems. On Friday, the deadline for U.S. students to submit resumes, the board had received more than 100 applications from Chinese nationals studying in this country, Chan said. The board will forward the resumes to U.S. and international companies in Singapore such as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, IBM, Texas Instruments, AT&T and Motorola, he said. Company representatives will make campus visits this fall to interview applicants, he said. For Chinese nationals whose U.S. visas are about to expire but who fear persecution or political uncertainty if they return to their homeland, the prospects of permanent residency in a country outside China could be very appealing. Yong-ping Zeng, a University of Southern California student who will soon graduate, would like to stay in the United States when he graduates, but he sent a resume to the development board last week to keep his options open. It's not easy getting a job in the United States, he said. "First they require you to have a green card, but to get a card you need a job. It's a bad circle." But Wang Shiqing, a post-doctoral researcher at UCLA who is not job hunting, said even if he were, he would not find Singapore attractive as a place to live and work. "It's such a small place," Wang said.
19891013000000000	POPE ATTACKS BIRTH CONTROL IN INDONESIA ON LAST DAY OF VISIT. John Paul II today attacked birth control in Indonesia, a Third World pioneer in restricting population growth. In a speech on the last day of his five-day visit to predominantly Muslim Indonesia, he told Catholic bishops: "You are sometimes painfully aware that certain traditional practices and other contemporary social influences bring about an obscuring of fundamental principles regarding family life and the responsible transmission of life." Vatican officials confirmed that this was a reference to birth control as well as polygamy and the subordinate position of women. Aggressive promotion of birth control has been official policy since 1970 in Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous country. President Suharto this year received the first U.N. award for population growth control.
19891125000000000	BUSH PROMOTES A CANARD. President Bush, with a veto, removed American support of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) from the foreign aid budget in the groundless belief that some of the dollars might find their way into coercive abortion programs in China. It is a regrettable extension of his decision to perpetuate the population policy of former President Ronald Reagan by seeking to impose restrictions on the use of abortion in poor foreign nations that are far more stringent than the standards in the United States. Worse, the action perpetuates canards about a successful, effective and principled U.N. program at a time when world population growth is at a crisis level. In the legislation vetoed by the President, $15 million of $220 million for population programs was to go to the UNFPA. Under a carefully crafted bipartisan amendment, none of the U.S. contribution would go to UNFPA's work in China. That was to avoid even the appearance of giving support to the Chinese population program, which is under fire for allegedly including coercive abortion and sterilization. Never mind that there is no evidence that UNFPA in any way aided or abetted the controversial elements of the Chinese program. Never mind that the new UNFPA-China agreement reinforces that separation. And never mind that there would be no better way to discourage abusive programs than to enhance contraceptive campaigns, a main thrust of UNFPA. Fortunately, the United States stands alone on this issue. All of the other major nations, led by Japan and including the Soviet Union, have stepped in to make up the declining American funding. The UNFPA, once dependent on the United States for 25% of its support, now spends even more with no U.S. support. But the missing dollars have hurt. Some of the replacement money received is not readily convertible. And the absence of U.S. leadership and cooperation serves to weaken the effort. President Bush leads the world's richest, most powerful nation, a nation that has gained effective control of its own population. But his nation is part of a world whose population is out of control. There were 1.6 billion people 90 years ago. There are 5.2 billion now. And there will be 6 billion by the end of the century. A quarter of those now living are hungry, and even more are malnourished. It is a situation that calls for vigorous leadership and more, not less, funds for effective world programs. Everywhere. Not least in China.
19901218000000000	SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD; CASE STUDY / EMIGRATION; THIRD WORLD WOES FORCING A NEW EXODUS; AROUND THE GLOBE, LEAVING HOME IS THE ONLY RESPONSE TO PROBLEMS SEEMINGLY TOO NUMEROUS TO OVERCOME.. Ahmed Fakhr, a career military officer who risked his life for Egypt in three wars, sat back in his chair and paused. The words were clearly difficult. "Fifteen years ago, I used to tell my two boys, if you leave this country and go work abroad, you are betraying your national cause. Stay here. Develop Egypt. The government paid for your health care, for your education. Stay here." Fakhr sighed, then shrugged. "Today, I am preparing my two boys to emigrate," he said. "It's a question of the resources available, and the population." In Egypt, a country overwhelmed by a million new mouths every nine months, leaving has long been a response to an economy unable to keep up with an exploding population. But its desperation is reaching new heights, and similar despair is evident in many other countries. Like a global game of musical chairs, the world is witnessing the uprooting of tens of millions of people as factors once unique to countries like Egypt -- economic misery, uncontrolled growth and limited space -- spur an unprecedented human exodus. "This is likely to be the biggest movement of humanity in world history," said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "All corners of the globe will be affected, directly and because of the rippling-down effect." The list seems endless: Soviet Jews to Israel. Vietnamese to Hong Kong and Hong Kong Chinese to Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Belize or Singapore. Moroccans, Tunisians and Algerians to France, Spain and Italy. Burmese to Thailand; Mozambicans to Malawi. Afghans to Pakistan and Iran. East Europeans to West Europe. Filipinos and Gypsies to any place that will take them. The United States is hardly exempt. Although only a few of the vast numbers who want to emigrate there make it, the total still is enough to change the American complexion. In the 21st Century, white descendants of European settlers will become a minority -- reflecting the effects of immigration and higher birthrates among blacks and Latinos. The change in other countries will be just as dramatic. Birth control in the West and Japan is creating aging societies and shortages of younger laborers, while developing nations produce more people than they can ever hope to accommodate, further fueling emigration. But the two countervailing trends are unlikely to neatly cancel each other out. Indeed, the world's widening demographic imbalance and the momentous flow of humanity will be among the most divisive and destabilizing issues of the 21st Century. Immigration already is emerging as a powerful political issue, contributing to resurgent racism and nativism, providing a tempting target for right-wing movements and producing a sharper international division between North and South. Although it cannot be calibrated precisely, emigration appears to be growing exponentially. "In the past 10 years, since 1980, we've seen at least a doubling of the pool of people seeking access to other countries," said David Simcox, director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. "And that's a conservative estimate." Many specialists predict that emigration could double again by 2000, especially with political upheavals worldwide. The Soviet empire's possible collapse could trigger a massive exodus. More than 500,000 Soviets left this year after exit permit requirements were scrapped; between 7 million and 20 million are expected to leave in the 1990s. One million have applied for U.S. residence -- more than the total number of Soviet emigres bound for all destinations since World War II. In South Africa, the anticipated end of apartheid has led thousands of whites to apply for the British citizenship of their ancestors. As Hong Kong nears the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China, 1,000 already are leaving weekly. Closer to home, 22% of Mexicans who participated in a 1989 Times Mirror poll said they were likely to move to the United States -- a figure comparable to the number of North Africans and East Europeans who would like to get into Western Europe. The new human wave underscores a shift from previous eras. In the postwar period, most emigrants sought refuge from political oppression or conflicts; today, the main motive is economic, often the byproduct of population growth. But doors are rapidly closing in front of them as the world runs out of inhabitable frontiers. Many industrialized nations no longer want the developing world's demographic overflow -- the largely unskilled workers once welcomed to foster industrialization. Australia and Canada, which once encouraged immigration, have begun to limit refugees and unskilled laborers, particularly Southeast Asians, in favor of skilled immigrants. And the asylum once offered to those living under totalitarian rule is being curtailed as ideologies like apartheid and communism are waning. Nicaraguans who fled the Somoza dictatorship in the 1970s or the Marxist Sandinista rule in the 1980s now want to escape the economic mess that was inherited -- and remains unsolved -- by Managua's new democracy. But no country is eager to take them. "For all the free flow of information, the tremendous flow of capital, the great mobility because of transportation, borders are more impenetrable than they've ever been for people," Meissner said. "It's a paradox between the rigidity of the state in physical terms and a world where everything else is opening up." In France, home to 4.5 million immigrants, Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front has become a credible political force by calling for limits on immigration. Likewise, Italy's Lombard League, Austria's Freedom Party and Germany's neo-Nazi National Alternative Party are stimulating new waves of nativism through anti-immigration campaigns. "The spillover of the demographic explosion is no longer going to be confined to the cantons and the bush," said Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian sociologist. "The spillover will go north (to the developed world) and will create tension and the emergence of racism and all kinds of chauvinisms in the world." Immigrants already are feeling the pressures. Vietnamese in Czechoslovakia have complained publicly about increasing assaults and racial insults. Street protests erupted in Hong Kong against the government's policy of offering asylum to Vietnamese "boat people" -- despite their restriction to detention camps. And North Africans in France went on the rampage in a housing project in Lyon to protest police harassment of immigrants. In addition to the North-South fault line, tension over immigration is playing out between East and West. Once an escape route for East Bloc refugees, Austria has deployed army patrols along the border in response to domestic protests against an influx of Romanians seeking escape from economic hardships. It also reintroduced visa requirements. The wave of nativism is ironic, because some major political and economic powers are facing unprecedented population decreases and will need infusions of labor. Indeed, several European countries and Japan have birthrates so low they may be unable to maintain their economic superiority. Before reunification, West Germany's average birthrate was only 1.4 child per couple, well below the 2.1 average that sustains a population without growth. Italy's rate is only 1.3, lowest in the world. Japan faces the same crisis. Its birthrate dropped from 3.1 per couple after World War II to 1.6 today. It also has the longest life expectancy -- and fewer workers to support an increasing population of pensioners. The developed world -- including Europe, North America and Japan -- accounts for 23% of the world population. By 2000, it will generate only 6% of world population growth. In contrast, Africa, which contains 12% of the world's people, will provide 23% of the growth by 2000. Most of the developed world, however, is reluctant to balance its population shortfall with new immigrants -- and the accompanying alien cultures, religions and higher birthrates that could erode the dominant social fabric. Rather than take more immigrants, France introduced welfare and tax incentives to existing citizens who have more children. Italy is attempting to lure emigrants back from Latin America. Ahmed Fakhr's sons -- Hossam, 31, and Haten, 33 -- are among the fortunate few who have options. Both are multilingual and college-educated; they have skills that open doors. Hossam is a U.N. translator; Haten has worked for U.S. companies in Cairo. For others, the outlook is bleak. Fakhr, for one, predicts that efforts to erect legal barriers to new immigration in many countries will fuel resentment and possible strife. "The moment these people find that it's their survival," he said, " . . . they'll use violence and force."
