19920131000000000	FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (9): At the parting of the ways - Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals. THE PATHS followed over the last year by the world's chemical and pharmaceutical industries have diverged markedly, in spite of their common scientific base. Buoyed by ageing populations and increasingly expensive and sophisticated drugs, pharmaceutical groups have proved inoculated against the insidious slowdown of the world economy. In contrast, the chemicals sector has confirmed its lamentable reputation for being the most cyclical of industries. Two problems dominate the chemicals sector: the recession and the environment. The industry is making too little money as it makes too much pollution. The chemicals industry is bleeding cash. The recession and the Gulf war have battered demand for basic chemicals. At the same time, capacity ordered in the boom times of the late 1980s - when even the least efficient plants were profitable - continues to come on stream, increasing competition still further. The consequent squeeze on margins has been further exacerbated by the increased capital costs required by ever-tougher environmental legislation. Complying with environmental legislation is cutting deeply into ordinary capital expenditure. Increasing public and legislative demands for more environmental protection appear unlikely to slacken in coming years. At the end of last year, German chemical companies complained that new taxes on emissions would stretch the industry to its limits, making Germany too expensive for manufacturing certain types of products. In Britain, too, environmental spending is set to mushroom. The UK's Chemical Industry Association estimates capital expenditure on the environment will double between 1990 and 1992 from Pounds 200m a year to Pounds 400m. It is now 25 per cent of all investment. With costs and capacity rising, while demand falls, the descent from profits to loss has been precipitous. There are few signs of an upturn. Even the German giants, hitherto protected by German reunification, are suffering a slowdown. Mr Wolfgang Hilger, president of the German Chemical Industry Association, warned this month that the German domestic market was likely to stagnate this year and there was no sign of upturn in export markets. Only in the Far East has demand held up, but capacity there, particularly in the petrochemical sector, looks set to grow rapidly over the next few years as investments by newly industrialised nations come on stream. The contrast with the pharmaceuticals sector could not have been more marked. Drugs have proved a panacea for those companies trying to escape the roller-coaster ride of the cyclical commodity chemicals business. ICI and Rhone-Poulenc, two groups traditionally involved with basic chemicals, reported profits last year heavily dependent upon the success of their pharmaceuticals business. For the pure pharmaceuticals companies 1991 was a heady year. Most European pharmaceuticals groups proved the ultimate counter-cyclical stocks, with the sector reporting sales growth averaging 13 per cent over the past 12 months. But although the pharmaceuticals market remains buoyant, the horizon is not without its clouds. Research and development costs are rising inexorably at the same time as governments are beginning to balk at the ever increasing cost of drugs. Western governments are grappling with ever increasing healthcare budgets. In Germany, for example, health costs more than 13 per cent of GNP. Drugs form a significant proportion of such costs and have been designated as easy targets for recession-battered governments. In Germany, pharmaceutical spending represents nearly 16 per cent of healthcare costs, while in Italy and Portugal it represents more than 30 per cent. Prices are likely to come under increasing pressure in coming years. And the sparkling performance of the pharmaceuticals groups over the last 12 months has not helped their position. In the US, the world's largest drug market, Senator Edward Kennedy has conducted a vocal campaign to restrain price increases for drugs sold to public health service-funded institutions. A wave of pricing legislation is presently sweeping through Congress questioning the sector's pricing structure. A debate also opened up last year on whether uncontrolled healthcare costs had not become a full-blown contagion - one that was sapping the nation's competitiveness and standard of living. It is far from clear whether the pharmaceutical industry's traditional defences - the need to reinvest profits in research and development, and the requirement for a return for the significant risks involved in drug development - will withstand the current political tide. Outside the US, governments are already attempting to limit drugs expenditure through: Lists of products which doctors are forbidden to prescribe or for which patients receive only partial reimbursement. Obligatory and direct price cuts. Profit controls which insist on a limited return on capital employed. Controls on marketing costs. Penalising doctors who prescribe excessively. Encouraging generic, non-patented, cheaper products. At the same time, the pharmaceutical groups continue to struggle with the inexorable rise in research and development costs. Such growth in costs is partly explained by the increasing complexity of new drugs. But it has also been caused by the growth in regulation to test the safety, quality and efficacy of drugs. Meanwhile, recessionary storms appear to have set in for the duration over the the basic chemicals industry. Dark clouds may also be gathering for the pharmaceuticals sector.
19920303000000000	FT  03 MAR 92 / The appliance of commerce: Wellcome's increasing presence in the international pharmaceuticals market. What would Sir Henry Wellcome think? The company he founded in 1880 to make 'compressed medicines' or tablets, has become one of the world's fastest-growing pharmaceuticals businesses. Now, with the proposed sale by the medical charity, Wellcome Trust, of much of its controlling stake, the company will fully enter the commercial world. It will have to satisfy the more rigorous demands of institutional shareholders but will have greater management freedom to run its business. Since 25 per cent of Wellcome's shares were floated on the stock market in 1986 it has become one of the largest public companies in the UK. The Trust, to which Sir Henry bequeathed the company, has seen the value of its shareholding grow to a point where it feels it must reduce its 73.6 per cent shareholding to diversify its investments. At the time of the flotation Sir Alfred Shepperd, the chairman and chief executive who retired in 1990, insisted that the group was a commercial business, run to make profits. Since then the company has become a much stronger competitor in the world drugs industry. As one industry observer put it: 'The company had a pretty closeted past.' Research scientists could enjoy working at Wellcome as though it were an academic institution. The company would pursue the scientifically fascinating rather than the commercially promising. But that has all changed. Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, has been pursuing a restructuring programme aimed at sharpening the business and increasing profit margins. The strategy is nearing completion and he now supports the Trust's plans to sell a large part of its stake. Previously he had feared such a large sale would have been disruptive. As part of this programme, several tough decisions have been taken. The group gave up work on TPA, a blood clot dissolving drug. That was hard, Mr Robb says, after more than Pounds 40m had been spent on it. But Wellcome realised it would be difficult to make a commercial success of the product. Other measures have included the sale of peripheral activities where margins were low. These included businesses, such as vaccines, to which Wellcome had a strong sentimental attachment. There have been cuts in overheads, including about 10 per cent of the 400 jobs at its London head office. Wellcome has also made a much more determined effort to market its drugs. As a result the company's fast profit growth, which had slowed in the 1989-90 financial year, has resumed. This year pre-tax profits are forecast to top Pounds 500m, a rise from Pounds 402.9m in 1990-91. And the balance sheet is strong, with net cash of about Pounds 200m at the end of August last year. The story of Wellcome's stock market career has been dominated by Retrovir, its high-profile Aids drug. Launched in 1987, it is still the only widely used treatment for the condition. The company's share price has fallen and, more often, risen with the ebb and flow of news about Retrovir. But there is more to the company's drugs profile. It has arguably the best record of any UK drug company for turning research and development into new products. It has accelerated the rate at which it launches new drugs, developing a product almost every year for the past decade. Wellcome's strength in research and its dominance of the anti-viral market have been the basis of its growth. But the therapeutic power of its products had not been matched by its salesmanship. Its best-selling drug, Zovirax, used to treat herpes, shingles and now chicken pox, was launched in 1981. Only now, as its patents are approaching the end of their lives, is it realising its full sales potential of about Pounds 500m a year. Since Mr Robb joined the company in March 1989 as deputy chief executive, co-marketing deals and higher prices for Zovirax have improved profit margins. Both Retrovir and Zovirax faced the problem of being launched into a new market, although the publicity surrounding Aids has meant a greater public awareness of Retrovir. Its sales growth since its launch has outstripped that of Zovirax in the initial years. 'Retrovir, too, was not as well marketed as it might have been,' says Mr Jonathan de Pass, an industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The possibility that Wellcome is failing to maximise drugs sales and, therefore, profits is also reflected in the company's 25 per cent gross profit margin - lower than that of its competitors in the drugs business, ICI, Glaxo or Fisons. Wellcome's newfound marketing priority is important, too, in its non-prescription drugs business. It is noted for its cough and cold remedies, Actifed and Sudafed, and for other over-the-counter (OTC) products that can be bought without a prescription, such as Calpol, a pain reliever for infants. Aggressive marketing is also preparing the ground for the sale of Zovirax as a treatment for cold sores, without a prescription. Mr Robb denies that the business of selling low-technology OTC cures is out of place in a research-driven company. He says: 'A significant position in OTC will become increasingly important as pressure on prices of prescription drugs increases.' As margins are squeezed on prescription drugs Wellcome can turn to OTC drugs as a stable source of income. While Glaxo, for example, disposed of its OTC drugs several years ago, Mr Robb sees OTC as a means of extending the profit-earning life of a drug. When a prescription drug loses its patent, rivals can produce the same drug cheaply. But the hope is by turning a prescription drug into a branded consumer product premium prices can be maintained. Already Zovirax is being sold over the counter in New Zealand. SmithKline Beecham has a similar philosophy. It has earmarked its ulcer treatment, Tagamet, once the world's best-selling drug, for OTC sales to treat upset stomachs. Wellcome is seeking a partner to expand its international OTC business. It hopes to announce a deal this year. Wellcome's need for marketing partners is not confined to OTC drugs. While it is strong in selling anti-viral drugs, its new products - essential for the group's profits growth - are in areas where it has little experience. These include epilepsy, muscle relaxants (for operations), hepatitis-B and, eventually, the potentially big market of migraine treatments. These new drugs will need to compensate for the eventual decline of Zovirax. Investors considering whether to buy the shares released by the Trust will have to decide whether the promise of products in the pipeline will enable Wellcome to continue its strong stock market performance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WELLCOME: A FREER HAND  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key products for the 1990s  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Drug           Treatment               1991          Estimated                                       sales      sales by 1995                                      Pounds             Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Zovirax        Anti-virus              471m               870m Retrpvor       Anti-Aids               177m               300m Exosurf        Lung treatment for                premature babies         22m               100m Wellferon      Hepatitis-B              12m                80m Lamictal       Epilepsy           New launch              100m BW256U &       Replace  BW882C        Zovirax            1995/97 launch  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Wellcome, BZW, Lehman Brothers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 UK TRUSTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Grants             Assets                         Pounds m           Pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wellcome Trust             58.40           3,250.00 Tudor Trust                15.78             117.16 Gatsby Charitable          11.84             198.66   Foundation Leverhulme Trust           11.20             330.00 Royal Society              10.67              28.86 Wolfson Foundation          8.64              54.74 Henry Smith                 7.49             100.00   (Estates Charities) Baring Foundation           7.25              38.64 Rank Foundation             7.19             107.49 Monument Trust              7.07              74.63  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Chartites Aid Foundation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
19920227000000000	FT  27 FEB 92 / Denmark asks EC to look at Glaxo pricing. GLAXO, the UK pharmaceuticals group, is being challenged over its European drug pricing strategy. The Danish office of fair trading has asked the European Commission to investigate whether the company is abusing a dominant market position by charging excessively high prices for its drugs. Glaxo's strategy of commanding premium prices for innovative products could be severely undermined if the Danish move is successful. The group needs to generate substantial revenues from new pharmaceutical products over the next few years if it is to compensate for an expected fall in sales of Zantac, its best-selling ulcer drug. The Danish authorities have complained about the price of three recently introduced products: Imigran, a migraine drug; Serevent, an asthma product; and Zofran, an anti-cancer pharmaceutical. All three drugs have been described by analysts as possible 'blockbusters' with potential sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) a year. Analysts forecast Imigran will generate revenues of more than Dollars 2bn a year by 1997. In order to prove that Glaxo is abusing a dominant position, the Commission will have to show that it charges excessive prices by conducting an analysis of the cost of producing the drug. The European Court of Justice has ruled in the past that prices are excessive when they have no reasonable relation to 'the economic value' of the product. Glaxo said last night it was studying the Danish complaint. The company said its drug prices reflected the benefit of each product to society and the patient, as well as the cost of research and development. It expects to spend Pounds 600m on R&D this year. Mr Robin Gilbert, an analyst at James Capel, said the Danish move was unprecedented. He said the complaint was unlikely to have much effect on sales in the short term, but that it could be significant in the long term if it made other governments question Glaxo's pricing policy. 'Pricing is becoming a hot subject. This is an unpleasant straw in the wind,' he added. The Danish announcement, just before the London stock market closed, led to a 10p fall in Glaxo's price. The stock closed up 1p on the day at 794p.
19920221000000000	FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Glaxo. The market was too quick to interpret yesterday's half-year figures from Glaxo as evidence that Zantac is faltering. Underlying growth of the ulcer drug was certainly down on the most recent 12-month period, but a buyers' strike in Italy and an obligatory Medicaid refund in the US exaggerated the trend. Even with these disappointments Glaxo's overall sales at constant exchange rates increased by an impressive 18 per cent in the six months, against just 16 per cent for the financial year 1991 as a whole. Prospects for the new generation of Glaxo drugs are little clearer. The anti-emetic product Zofran looks like hitting Pounds 250m of sales for the full year, but the question remains whether it can be sold to treat other illnesses. The jury remains out on Imigran, which looks set to receive US approval this summer, and on scare-affected Serevent. Investors will take more encouragement from news that marketing expenses should fall as a proportion of sales, and that increases in R & D spending will in future mirror sales growth. Both developments are good for margins. With perhaps one third of the equity now in US hands the key to the next share price move almost certainly lies on Wall Street. Comparisons may be pertinent with 1983, a year when the world economy was coming out of recession and Zantac won approval in the US. The first half then saw continued outperformance, though on the back of the sort of heavy US demand which nine years later may have run out of steam. The second half of 1983 saw a sharp underperformance, more than wiping out the relative gains of the first six months.
19920421000000000	FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (17): Taste of triumph once again - Glaxo. GLAXO, the pharmaceuticals group and the UK's biggest company by market capitalisation, has won its fifth award for technology with its antibiotic, Zinnat. Zinnat was developed because other drugs in its class needed to be injected and were therefore of little use outside the hospital environment. In addition, bacteria were building up resistance to existing antibiotics, such as penicillin, which were proving increasingly less effective. The challenge for Glaxo was to develop a drug that was: pleasant to swallow. The active ingredient within Zinnat, Cefuroxime Axetil, had an extremely unpleasant taste. stable in water so that it retained its potency within the stomach and gut. resistant to the enzymes in the gut but which could be ingested effectively into the body. quick acting once it had been taken into the blood-stream. without any toxic by-products and therefore without serious side-effects. able to resist Beta-lactamase, a substance excreted by bacteria which prevents some antibiotics working effectively. Glaxo believes it tested as many as 10,000 different formulations at its Greenford research centre in north-west London over a period of about six years before it discovered the right drug. Its pharmacists also invented a new process to manufacture a wax coating around the drug. The coating was not unpleasant to taste but dissolved when required in the gut to release the active ingredients. Since it was launched in 1987, more than 25m people have been treated with the drug. Zinnat is used for a large number of infections, ranging from upper respiratory infections such as tonsilitis and sinusitis, to urinary tract infections and gonorrhoea. Clinical trials showed that cure or improvement is achieved in more than 88 per cent of patients with lower respiratory infections and more than 90 per cent of patients with gonorrhoea. Zinnat also has a low incidence of side-effects. More than Pounds 500m of sales have been generated by the drug since its launch, which, according to Glaxo, makes its the second best-selling antibiotic in its class. Previous awards for technology were for Ventolin and Becotide, the asthma drugs, Zantac, an ulcer treatment which is the world's best-selling medicine, and Fortum, another antibiotic. Glaxo has spent nearly Dollars 4bn on research and development over the last 10 years. In the last fiscal year alone, Glaxo spent Dollars 880m on research and development and is expected by analysts to spend more than Dollars 1bn - more than any other company. Its nearest rival is probably Merck of the US.
19920402000000000	FT  02 APR 92 / Glaxo's head of French operations leaves company. GLAXO'S president of French operations, Mr Edwin Nathan, has left the company, following a breakdown in relations between the British group and the French government over the pricing of Imigran, its new migraine drug. Glaxo refused to give reasons for his move. He was in charge of negotiations with the French government for Imigran. Last month, he told a French newspaper that in exchange for a high price for Imigran, Glaxo would construct a FFr1bn (Pounds 100m) factory in France, set up a research and development centre or co-market the drug with Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group. Such deals are common in France though are not normally referred to in public. He told Les Echos, the French financial daily: 'The different ministers are dragging out the negotiations, perhaps in order not to take risks before the next elections.' He pointed out France was one of the last European countries to license Imigran. Two weeks later, the French government ordered an investigation into the ethical, legal and medical acceptability of methods used by Glaxo to market Imigran. It set up a commission to decide whether to ask the European Commission to investigate possible abuse of market position. French officials said they were concerned that Glaxo was generating public pressure on the government to license the drug. In particular, they were irritated by the number of articles about Imigran in consumer magazines. France traditionally has low pharmaceuticals prices, but has among the largest per capita consumption of drugs in Europe. France spent 8.7 per cent of its GNP last year on healthcare, the second highest spending in Europe after Germany. Drugs represented 17.3 per cent of its health budget. Glaxo has a strategy of charging high prices for innovative products. The group, like other pharmaceuticals companies, is finding it hard to maintain prices for existing products in Japan and Europe. In the US, many have been forced by political pressure to introduce voluntary price freezes or promises not to increase prices above the rate of inflation. Mr Nathan is to be replaced by Mr Christopher Adam, Glaxo's commercial director. He was Mr Nathan's predecessor in France.
19920618000000000	FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Japanese drug-makers slow off the mark - Pharmaceutical groups are under pressure to expand and innovate. A RUSH to invest overseas by Japanese pharmaceutical companies in the late 1980s appeared to signal their entrance on to the world stage. However, it has since become clear that Japanese pharmaceutical groups are far from becoming the Toyotas or Matsushitas of the global drugs market. Despite strong efforts by some Japanese groups, the country's pharmaceutical industry has been unable to develop the world-beating innovatory products needed to break into overseas markets. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, with annual sales of Y226bn (Dollars 1.8bn) and one of the drugs companies to expand most aggressively internationally, hopes to be a truly global company within the next 10 years. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, Japan's third-largest with sales of Y227bn, says: 'It's essential for Japanese companies to globalise since domestic market conditions are going to be increasingly difficult.' However, western managers have doubts. Mr Thomas Hofstatter, executive managing director of Hoechst Japan, says most Japanese drugs companies are going to take time to grow into leading global operations unless a real breakthrough product is discovered. In the 1980s, most Japanese drugs companies started their overseas expansion with simple licensing agreements and established clinical trial offices. The more ambitious, however, set up joint ventures or acquired distributors in the US and Europe. Fujisawa acquired Lyphomed, a small drugs company in the US, and Yamanouchi built a manufacturing plant in Ireland, a research centre in Oxford and, last year, acquired the pharmaceutical division of Gist-Brocades, a Dutch chemical company. Japanese drugs-makers are now trying to build comprehensive independent operations in research and development, production, and marketing. Fujisawa is increasing production and marketing capacity in the US and Europe ahead of the launch of FK-506, an immune system suppressor used to prevent transplant patients rejecting their new organs. However, compared with the multi-billion dollar mergers and acquisitions of US and European companies, the Japanese operations and acquisitions have been modest in size. Total overseas sales by Japanese pharmaceutical companies remain around 5 per cent of their turnover, compared with 30 to 50 per cent of leading US companies and 70 to 90 per cent of leading European companies. The main barrier for the Japanese companies has been their lack of marketable products, as most have lagged in the development of important new drugs. This was due to their reliance on small-step innovations of existing drugs, mainly lower-value antibiotics and vitamins. Mr Muneyuki Sakai, pharmaceutical analyst at County NatWest in Tokyo, says an overseas subsidiary needs at least four or five original mainline products. Exceptions to this pattern include Sankyo, with its anti-cholesterol product Mevalotin. The drug has annual exports to its licensees of Y13.2bn. Yamanouchi is known for its anti-ulcer agent Gastar, which had Y90bn overseas sales last year. Japanese drug companies have traditionally been complacent about R&D because of the government's pricing policy on drugs. The Health Ministry used to award all new drugs premium prices, whether they were improvements or not, and failed to give drug companies an incentive to develop innovative drugs. Rather than take the risk of spending high sums on product development, many of the larger companies chose to only make small improvements of existing drugs, and distribute drugs supplied by foreign companies under licence for the Japanese market only. Development programmes have also been hurt by cumulative price cuts by the Health Ministry, which started in 1981. It forced 10 to 15 per cent price reductions every two years. This pressured cash-flow at the Japanese drug companies, which are considerably smaller than their western counterparts. However, attitudes towards R&D are changing rapidly as innovation has become the key to profits. The ministry is pushing for innovative drugs through a change in its pricing rules. From this fiscal year, the only drugs to be allowed premium prices will be those which represent a new concept, are more effective than existing drugs, and which make a noticeable contribution to treatment. At the same time, foreign drug companies have started to end distribution tie-ups as they establish their own networks in Japan, reducing commissions at the former Japanese partners. Ultimately, companies will need to establish a worldwide presence in order to recoup mounting R&D costs. Fujisawa needs to globalise because its market share in Japan has hit a ceiling and profits have reached their upward limit. Companies which do not succeed internationally will see a pressure on profits. In the long run, Japanese companies are expected to become more innovative. However, for companies whose development policies are aimed at marginal improvements, changing direction will not be easy. Mr John Wilson, analyst at James Capel, says: 'Companies are under pressure, with sales of the industry growing at 5 per cent and costs of R&D increasing by 10 per cent.' Since a typical drug takes 10 years and Y10bn to develop, only those companies large enough to absorb the costs will be able to survive. Mr Sakai at County NatWest believes that about 10 companies, led by Sankyo, Fujisawa, and Yamanouchi, will be able to establish a position in the international pharmaceutical market. In the near future, companies predict a wave of mergers and acquisitions, especially rescues of smaller companies lacking new products. Takeda, the industry leader, says: 'There are a lot of negotiations going on behind the scenes.' Mergers and acquisitions by foreign companies, in line with Merck and Banyu in 1983, and more recently Bohringer Ingelheim and Yamaguchi Seiyaku in 1990, are also expected to increase, as Japanese companies are now cheaper following the slump in Japanese share prices.
19920629000000000	FT  29 JUN 92 / Cancer charity in pioneer drug deal. CANCER Research Campaign, the UK charity, has signed a deal with a US pharmaceuticals company to develop a pioneering cancer treatment which could earn the charity as much as Pounds 20m a year. The drug, called Temozolomide, is the first effective treatment for glioma, a form of brain-tumour. Cancer Research funded research and development of the drug which was originally discovered by Aston University in Birmingham. Further clinical trials to establish the drug's effectiveness on other forms of cancer are being set up. Professor Edward Newlands, the head of cancer medicine at Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School and director of the drug's clinical trials, said it may prove effective against bone marrow cancer. The agreement with Schering-Plough, the largest ever concluded by the charity's wholly-owned technology transfer company, is worth an immediate Dollars 1.5m with a further Dollars 4m paid to the charity during development. Once the drug is launched, the charity will receive royalty payments. These could be worth up to Pounds 20m a year, according to Dr Sue Foden, managing director of Cancer Research Campaign Technology, the charity's technology transfer subsidiary. Last year the charity's income, raised mainly through voluntary contributions, was Pounds 40.6m. Under the agreement, the charity will receive about 40 per cent of royalties which are worth between 2 per cent and 8 per cent of sales depending on volume. The remaining 60 per cent of royalties will be paid to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American company that helped with initial research, Aston University which discovered the molecule, and Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School which developed it. Professor Newlands explained that half of glioma patients using the drug had shown clinical benefit, and as many as 40 per cent had demonstrated an improvement when examined with brain-scans. Patients with skin cancer had also shown some improvement. He said this was the first time a drug had had a repeatable noteworthy effect on brain tumours. The charity said that it hoped Schering-Plough would be able to use the US Food and Drug Administration's accelerated licensing programme so that the medicine would be on the American market within five years. The potential market for Temozolomide was difficult to predict because it depended whether it worked against other cancers, Professor Newlands said.
19920603000000000	FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: British Biotechnology pathfinder published. BRITISH Biotechnology Group yesterday published the pathfinder prospectus for its international share offer planned for July. The Oxford-based pharmaceutical company says it aims to raise some Pounds 30m by selling about 20 per cent of its equity through a share issue in London and New York. The issue is expected to be priced at between 400p and 450p, valuing the company at about Pounds 150m. British Biotechnology will use the proceeds of the flotation primarily to fund its research and development programme, which covers four medical areas: inflammatory diseases such as arthritis; cancer; vascular and heart disease; and viral infections, including Aids. It has two drugs undergoing in early clinical trials and a third due to begin clinical testing in August. But the group 'does not expect to market or generate revenues from the commercialisation of its pharmaceutical products until at least the latter half of the 1990s.'
19920602000000000	FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (4): Cornerstone of economic development in the 1990s - Pharmaceuticals thrives in Montreal. THE WESTERN suburbs of Montreal illustrate the turnround in the Quebec pharmaceuticals industry - from decline in the early 1980s to a cornerstone of economic development in the 1990s. Hoffman-La Roche, Canadian arm of the Swiss multinational, built extensive new research and manufacturing space in pastoral Vaudreuil. The multi-storey tower and five-storey building alongside were designed for the 21st century. But in 1969, the federal government introduced compulsory licensing for imported products and reduced basic patent protection for brand-name medicines to four years. The company never moved into its space-age facilities. Nor did an American-based concern which had built a new research lab in the same area. Hoffman-La Roche moved its Canadian head office to Ontario and its Canadian research facilities to the US. It waited several years to sell its Vaudreuil venture. The brand-name companies maintained that patent protection had been reduced to the clear advantage of generic producers in the name of lower drug prices. They warned that the compulsory licensing system would not work for Canada or Quebec. The exodus continued. By the early 1980s, Ayerst, McKenna & Harrison closed its Montreal laboratory, merging it into the parent's US research operations. A few enterprising researchers stayed put, however. With Canadian financial backing, one group founded a new company specialising in products for treating diseases of the immune system and cancer and viral diseases. Six-year-old BioChem Pharma has yet to show an operating profit but it boasts a market valuation of CDollars 1bn. It is Glaxo's Canadian partner in developing anti-Aids drugs. A big change came in 1987 when Ottawa bowed to pressure from the multinationals and agreed to extend patent protection to seven years, in return for promises of sizeable investment in Canada. The same western suburbs of Montreal now display the results of the investment spree that followed. Nearly Dollars 500m has been invested by brand-name international and domestic companies in new research, laboratories and production plants in Quebec since then. Montreal has become the undisputed centre of Canada's pharmaceutical industry. Merck Frosst Canada, Burroughs Wellcome, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Group and BioChem Pharma are among those which led the way. Now the Federal Government plans to extend patent protection further in line with international practice and end compulsory licensing. 'We want the government to adopt legislation placing Canada on a level playing field with the major industrial nations for protection of pharmaceutical products,' says Mr Michael Carnow, president of Merck Frosst Canada. 'This will enable Canada and Quebec to compete for investment.' He said Gatt deadlines for agreement on patent protection have slipped and Canada should move unilaterally to ensure Canadian-based companies can compete. 'This will lead to more research and capital investment.' Merck Frosst has begun engineering work on a big manufacturing expansion in Montreal. The new plant will be geared to specific products for international markets. The company's Canadian research budget is CDollars 270m for 1991-95, including a new Dollars 70m research centre opened last September. Colin Mallet, president of Sandoz Canada, says the investment spree should continue. He predicts that hundreds of new research and production jobs will be created in Quebec and Canada this decade if conditions are favourable. The Quebec government is likely to work hard to ensure that the bulk of the new investment comes to the province. Pharmaceuticals represent one of Quebec's three most important competitive industrial clusters, employing more than 2,000 researchers and planning investment of up to Dollars 1.5b this decade. Almost half the total Canadian pharmaceutical industry and more than half its annual Dollars 300m research effort are now located in Quebec. The province has four university faculties of medicine, two pharmacology faculties, an array of specialised bodies such as the Montreal Clinical Research, Biotechnology Research and the Heart and Cancer Institutes. Research is also carried out at Laval University in Quebec City. The Quebec industry's activities range from basic, applied and clinical research to biotech engineering. Production includes fine chemicals, pharmaceutic and therapeutic products, vaccines, biological and diagnostic products. In 1990, the Quebec industry invested Dollars 126m in research, up 28 per cent from 1989, and the 1991 total was higher. It also includes some generic producers, though these have congregated mainly in Ontario. The federal government is now considering extending the patent protection period to 20 years after application or equivalent to about 10 years in the market place. 'With the population ageing, the industry will play a more crucial role in the economy,' says Mr Mallet. 'We're all moving towards longer protection, partly because testing lasts longer and is more complex. We must provide an environment fostering competition with other industrial countries in scientific expertise and patent protection. 'The dice are still loaded against Canada now because its local market is lost to generic manufacturers after only seven years. Canadian firms and researchers must be given a fighting chance.' Generic producers have reacted strongly to suggestions that patent protection will be extended significantly. Mr Barry Sherman, president of Apotex, Toronto, one of Canada's two biggest generic drug makers, said the government has capitulated to US pressure. Apotex is not going ahead with plans for a Dollars 50m extension to its Winnipeg plant.
19920602000000000	FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (2): Clusters hold key to markets - Industry. MR GERALD TREMBLAY, Quebec's industry minister, stands behind his desk energetically spreading a sheaf of brightly coloured charts in front of him, like a croupier dealing baccarat cards, These are the road maps, he explains, to Quebec's latest initiative to draw government, business, labour and academia together in a concerted industrial strategy. 'Can you manage a company without a business plan?' Mr Tremblay, who has an MBA from Harvard University, asks rhetorically. 'Why should a government be different?' Each diagram, with a complex pattern of lilac, orange and pink boxes (some of the boxes are multi-coloured) represents one of 13 industrial clusters. These are the sectors which Quebec believes have the best chance of being competitive in world markets. The aim is to encourage manufacturers in these industries to co-operate closely with suppliers, government, trade unions, university researchers and with each other, to create efficient and technologically advanced industries. Corporatism has been a cornerstone of Quebec economic policy for the past 30 years. Contracts for Hydro-Quebec's big James Bay power projects put muscle into the Quebec engineering and construction industries. Government direction and financial support have helped attract pharmaceutical and aerospace companies to the province. Getting everyone to pull in the same direction has been relatively easy in a province with a tightly-knit, homogeneous population. There is far more job hopping between the senior ranks of business and government in Quebec than in other parts of Canada. However, implementing a far-reaching industrial strategy is less simple than it used to be. The ability of the government to use financial support as a tool of its industrial policy is constrained by its CDollars 4bn budget deficit. Furthermore, Hydro-Quebec's construction programme will slow down sharply in the second half of the decade, forcing many local companies to look elsewhere for contracts. Mr Pierre Fournier, research director at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, Quebec's leading securities firm, predicts the government will be able to give little more than moral support to the new industrial cluster concept. 'I like it, but it's going to take a long time,' Mr Fournier says. The 13 clusters fall into two groups. Five sectors - aerospace, pharmaceuticals, information technology products, power generating equipment and metal processing - are well-established both in domestic and international markets. According to Mr Paul Lussier, director of investment services in the ministry of industry and commerce, Quebec has reached a point where 'no major pharmaceutical company does anything in North America without considering Quebec as an option. 'If we could do that in five or six sectors, we'd be in great shape'. The second group includes transport equipment, petrochemicals, agri-business, textiles and clothing, forestry, housing, environmental products, and cultural industries. Several of these sectors have faced severe competitive pressures in recent years, and will need a shake-up if they are to fulfil the hopes being placed in them. Their inclusion as clusters is partly a recognition of the province's natural resources and of these sectors vital importance to regional development. Each group of industries has set up a task force to identify its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the province's 16 regions have been asked to submit a cluster wish-list within the next few months. Mr Tremblay sees the government's role as a catalyst. 'It's a big puzzle and we put all the pieces together,' he says. For example, vigorous arm-twisting by Quebec has persuaded the federal government to locate a new Canadian space agency in Montreal. A forestry technology centre has moved from Ottawa to Quebec City. Among the products of collaboration with business taking shape is an institute for pharmaceutical research in Montreal. Twenty-one brand-name and generic drug makers have each contributed CDollars 100,000. The federal and provincial governments have chipped in another CDollars 6m between them. In spite of budget constraints, some government money is available for individual companies too. Since 1987, the government has provided over 1,000 businesses with CDollars 519m in loans. While the loans are repayable, the terms are generous. Principal repayments on a modernisation loan, for example, normally start only in the seventh year. Numerous tax incentives are available. Research and development expenses enjoy tax credits of up to 40 per cent. But in an effort to nudge academics towards practical research, the credits are doubled for R&D undertaken in partnership with a university. Foreign investment is an important part of Quebec's industrial strategy. US, European and Asian companies have large stakes in many of the 13 clusters, as well as other parts of the economy. Two of South Korea's biggest North American investments are in Quebec, in the form of a Hyundai car plant in the eastern townships and a Sami Steel factory in Montreal. Much of the emphasis in the years ahead will be on attracting more Asian capital. The government has just opened a trade and investment office in Vancouver, with a mandate to try and divert to Quebec some of the money flowing into Canada's western provinces from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.
19920601000000000	FT  01 JUN 92 / A marketing prescription for Wellcome / John Robb talks about prospects for the drugs group. WELLCOME'S chief executive, Mr John Robb, prides himself on his market-orientated approach to business. The 56-year-old Scot and former consumer products executive at Beecham has proved determined to make the group more market-driven since he was appointed by chairman Sir Alistair Frame in July 1990. But Mr Robb is now faced with the biggest marketing challenge of his life - the sale of up to 50 per cent of the group in the largest-ever issue by a privately-owned British company. The offer, scheduled for mid-July, could raise as much as Pounds 4bn. At first view his task should not be difficult. The company is the fastest growing among the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical companies. On a five-year average, Wellcome has enjoyed the highest earnings-per-share growth rate of any pharmaceutical stock - some 30.3 per cent compared with 17.6 per cent for Glaxo and 15.7 per cent for SmithKline Beecham. In addition, the company has a dominant position - about 80 per cent - in the fast-growing anti-viral market. Sales of Zovirax, its herpes treatment, are expected to grow by about 20 per cent during the next two years, reaching Pounds 820m by 1994. Retrovir, the anti-Aids drug also known as AZT, could reach annual sales of Pounds 340m in 1994, according to a recent note by SG Warburg, the company's brokers. But although Wellcome's short-term future looks bright, Mr Robb's task is complicated by two doubts on its long-term growth. First, the beneficial effects of the group's wide-ranging disposal programme run out next year. Since he took over the helm, operating margins have improved from 21.2 per cent in 1990 to 24.6 per cent last year. During the first half of this year, they rose 2.5 percentage points to 26.7 per cent. However, more than half of that improvement came from a programme of disposals which is now coming to an end. The second threat is the end of patents for Zovirax. During the first half of 1992, sales increased 26 per cent. Commentators believe as much as 40 per cent of Wellcome's revenue growth could come from this product next year. Its main patents expire in Germany next year, the UK in 1995 and the US and Japan in 1997. Sales are still growing remarkably fast, given that it was launched Mr Robb says he recognises the threat to Zovirax and has developed a twin strategy to deal with the problem. The first element consists of two new compounds known as 256U and 882C which should eventually replace Zovirax. The two drugs should be launched in 1995 and 1996, although both are still in clinical trials. Timing will be crucial. SmithKline Beecham, which Mr Robb acknowledges has an excellent marketing track-record is scheduled to launch a competitor drug, Famciclovir, in 1995. The other element of Mr Robb's defence strategy is to sell Zovirax without a doctor's prescription in chemists. 'We don't have the marketing clout to exploit Zovirax in the OTC (over-the counter) market on our own,' admits Mr Robb. 'We are looking for a partner, particularly in Europe. Two or three are left on the short-list.' He plays down another possible threat - that to Retrovir, Wellcome's anti-Aids drug. He argues analysts at one stage became fixated by Retrovir, seeing the group merely in relation to Aids, although the drug represented only 11 per cent of group turnover last year. Competition to Retrovir from new drugs is unlikely to make much impact in the medium term, reckons Mr Robb. 'Our view is that Aids will continue to be treated with Retrovir in combination with other therapies at least for the next five years. The market is growing and the competition is more noise than anything else at the moment.' Concern does exist about a challenge to Retrovir's US patent, however. The patent's validity is being challenged by Barr Laboratories, a US group. The outcome of the case is unclear, since it will be decided next year by a jury in North Carolina. If Wellcome loses it plans to appeal, but Barr would probably be able to market a generic version of the drug in the meanwhile. In spite of the problems facing the group, Mr Robb is confident he can deliver the targets he has promised. These include underlying sales growth in excess of 10 per cent, an operating margin of 30 per cent by 1996 and earning-per-share growth of more than 15 per cent a year. The group's research and development has become much more focused, he says. The company remains committed to outstanding research, but has adopted the project management approach perfected by Glaxo in the 1980s, which involves dropping compounds which fail to reach development targets on time. Since September 1989, the number of compounds in development has fallen from 78 to 34. Those drugs that are fully developed will be launched in all possible markets to justify the money invested in them - it costs up to Dollars 230m (Pounds 127m) to bring a drug to market. 'Marketing is terribly important. We have a great reputation in research and development, but not a comparable reputation in marketing,' he says. 'We used to think if we got the research and development right the products would sell themselves.' He plans to improve marketing by expanding Wellcome's sales force. He has also hired new sales managers for the US and Japan. Elsewhere he will continue his strategy of co-marketing with other companies. 'It's incredibly important to raise our marketing skills to the same level as our research and development skills,' says Mr Robb. 'If we don't we'll be in trouble.' As he launches a world-wide marketing campaign on Thursday, his most immediate challenge is to make sure the flotation itself does not run into trouble. With as much as Pounds 4bn at stake, his much-vaunted marketing skills will be in demand.
19920626000000000	FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome sale could raise about Pounds 3bn. WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, indicated yesterday it would sell 330m shares in Wellcome, the drug company, in next month's international tender offer. At yesterday's closing share price of 914p, up 1p, the offer would be worth Pounds 3bn. The prospectus, published yesterday, said the group expected pre-tax profits and earnings per share for the year to August 31 to be 'significantly higher than in the 1991 financial year'. Analysts are forecasting profits of Pounds 500m to Pounds 510m and earnings of about 36p per share. In 1991 pre-tax profits were Pounds 402.9m and earnings per share were 29.3p. Mr Lawrence Banks, head of corporate finance at Robert Fleming, the merchant bank co-ordinating the global offer, said the 330m figure was conservative and he was very confident there would be excess demand. He did not expect to decrease the issue size. Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the trust, said strong interest had been shown. The provisional allocation gives 165m to the UK market, 80m to the US, 25m to Japan and the remainder to be spread around the rest of the world. Within the UK portion, Pounds 180m-worth of shares is being earmarked for the public offer. The company today starts presentations to investors in 29 cities. The official tender process starts on July 6 and is expected to close on July 24. The UK public offer will close on July 21. The tender price and basis of allocations should be announced on July 27 with dealings suspended for the first 1 1/2 hours of that trading day. Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said yesterday he would emphasise five of the drug group's strengths to potential buyers. These included the group's dominance of the growing anti-viral drug market, its promising research and development pipeline and its emphasis on sales and marketing. He also pointed to Wellcome's strong volume growth in sales, limiting the effect of pricing pressures on drugs and the ability to increase margins. Mr Banks said that retail demand was hard to estimate. So far more than 250,000 people had rung the Wellcome share information office. Wellcome has about 23,000 individuals on its shareholder register, of which 10,000 are employees. More than 80 regional stockbrokers are prepared to apply on behalf of private investors, who can also participate via application forms. Existing Wellcome shareholders with addresses in the UK will receive a special application form giving them priority for up to Pounds 5,000-worth of shares. Retail investors have to offer to buy shares at the tender price being fixed through the international book-building process. However as the tender price will not be announced until a few days after the public offer closes applicants must specify the value of shares they wish to buy, with a minimum of Pounds 1,000. The maximum number of shares that could be sold is 417m. The sale of 330m shares would reduce the trust's stake from 73.5 per cent to 35.1 per cent. The trust can increase the issue and Fleming has the option to sell a further 15 per cent of the final size. If the maximum 417m were sold, the trust would be left with 25 per cent, which it says it would retain as a long term investment. The trust will be paying total commissions of between 3 1/2 and 3 3/4 per cent of the value of the shares sold.
19920626000000000	FT  26 JUN 92 / A Wellcome on the doormat: Paul Abrahams examines the issue of shares in the UK pharmaceuticals group. Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, will pack his bags today and head for his native Scotland. Edinburgh will be his first stop on a round-the-world road show, taking in more than 16 cities from San Francisco to Osaka. On his travels he aims to promote the sale of at least 330m shares worth about Pounds 3bn. Mr Lawrence Banks, head of corporate finance at Robert Fleming, the adviser to Wellcome Trust, the charity which currently holds 73.5 per cent of Wellcome, was optimistic about the offer yesterday. 'We have been pleased with the level of interest both in the UK and internationally in this first-rate pharmaceuticals company,' he said. In spite of Mr Banks's rhetoric, the issue's success hangs in the balance. Following last week's aborted flotation of GPA, the aircraft-leasing group, the outlook for new issues has clouded over. The prospects for pharmaceuticals groups are uncertain. Between 1985 and 1990 the world drugs market grew on average by 13 per cent a year; industry forecasts put the 1990-95 figure at 9 per cent; the five years after that could see as little as 5 per cent average growth. Last autumn, when preparations for Wellcome's offer began, Mr Robb's sales task appeared easier. Pharmaceuticals shares were star performers on global markets. Between January 1990 and December 1991, British healthcare stocks, driven by American buying, outperformed the UK market by 65 per cent. Over the same period, American drugs stocks outstripped the US market by 55 per cent. The reasons were clear. Ageing populations in developed countries ensured that demand for drugs continued to grow even during recession. That guaranteed earnings growth far in excess of that experienced by other sectors. But drugs stocks have now fallen from grace. Since January, US pharmaceuticals shares have underperformed the market by nearly 20 per cent. American investors, noting the apparent upturn in the US economy, have switched from recession-proof stocks into those that perform better during recovery. Wellcome has seen a similar shift in the UK. Its shares have fallen from Pounds 11.26 before the issue was announced on March 2 to 914p yesterday. Investors' enthusiasm has also been dampened by the increasingly hostile environment for drugs companies. Costs associated with the research, development and marketing of drugs are rising fast because drugs must go through expensive licensing procedures in individual countries at the same time. Meanwhile revenues are threatened by worldwide downward pressure on drugs prices as governments struggle to contain ever-growing health expenditure. Pharmaceuticals earnings have started to suffer. Some US groups had disappointing first-quarter results this year. Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's third-largest drugs company, fell 10 per cent on June 2 after it warned that sales growth for the second quarter would be less than 5 per cent. Against this difficult background Mr Robb must set out his case. First, he must convince doubting audiences that he has adopted the right strategy for Wellcome to escape the twin pressures of rising costs and falling prices; and he must answer misgivings about any perceived company weaknesses. The most crucial part of his tour will start next Friday when Mr Robb starts his US campaign. At least 80m shares, worth at present about Dollars 1.3bn, have been slated for American investors. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank advising Wellcome, will be charged with the successful selling of such a large volume. Although the issue is only half of the US's largest public stock offer last month, when General Motors raised Dollars 2.14bn, the British company is not widely known in north America. Only 2 per cent of its stock is owned in the US, compared with about 26 per cent of Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, and about 32 per cent of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American company. Another problem for Mr Robb's US campaign is that Wellcome's price-earnings ratio is slightly higher than that of Merck, the world's largest drug company and last year one of US investors' favourite stocks. Mr Steve Plag, pharmaceuticals analyst at County Natwest, the only important UK broker not directly involved in the issue, explained: 'On my calculations Wellcome is on a prospective price-earnings ratio of 22, whereas Merck is on 20 and Glaxo is on 18. The question is whether US investors will be willing to buy a stock on a higher ratio than Merck.' Nevertheless, Mr Robb can point to several factors in his company's favour. Wellcome is the fastest-growing of the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical companies. Over the past five years it has enjoyed the highest average annual earnings-per-share growth rate of any big pharmaceutical company - some 30.3 per cent compared with 17.6 per cent for Glaxo and 15.7 per cent for SmithKline Beecham. In the short term, in spite of difficult conditions, Wellcome's earnings growth looks assured. S G Warburg, the company's broker, forecast in its most recent circular that sales from continuing operations are set to grow at 16 per cent a year over the next three years. Meanwhile operating profit margins over the same period should increase from 24.6 per cent to 29 per cent. The strongest card in Mr Robb's hand is the company's ability to withstand pricing pressures. During the past six months, sales increased 21 per cent over the same period of 1991. But only 3 percentage points came from price increases. The rest was generated by volume growth. 'There's little disagreement that Robb and his new management team have done an excellent job and that earnings growth looks strong for the next two years,' said Mr Plag. 'The problem is what happens beyond that. There is a significant risk that earnings growth may start to decelerate.' Mr Plag claimed that the two main motors for earnings growth - the company's sales of less profitable subsidiaries, and Zovirax, the anti-viral treatment  -will start running out of steam soon. Unusually for such an 11-year-old product, Zovirax's sales are still growing fast. But growth is likely to slow in the mid-1990s despite Wellcome's acquisition of licences around the world for Zovirax to treat diseases such as chicken-pox and shingles. The drug's patents expire in Germany in 1993, followed by the UK in 1995 and the US - where 39 per cent of sales are made  -in 1997. The patent expiries could be significant because much of Wellcome's growth derives from Zovirax. Mr Plag estimates the product could account for more than 40 per cent of sales growth next year. For long-term prosperity Wellcome is dependent upon the development of new products to replace existing earners. The company's strong research base is clearly crucial, and Mr Robb says R&D investment will remain at about 14 per cent of sales for the foreseeable future. Since joining the company from Beecham, where he was consumer products executive, in 1989, Mr Robb has tried to integrate R&D more closely into the marketing effort. Symbolically, the group marketing operations have been moved to the Beckenham R&D site, providing far closer co-operation between the two divisions. 'Marketing is terribly important,' he said. 'We used to think if we got the research and development right the products would sell themselves. We have to market ourselves aggressively.' Rather than building up expensive marketing networks, however, the group is turning to co-marketing agreements with other companies. It has initialled deals with Hoechst in Germany, Sigma Tau in Italy and Sumitomo in Japan to help market Zovirax. Last spring the company conducted the most thorough review of its R&D projects it had undertaken. Its aim was to avoid research on scientifically interesting but commercially fruitless compounds. As a result, numerous products were dropped, leaving resources for fewer but potentially more lucrative drugs, such as Atovaquone, Wellcome's medicine for Aids-related pneumonia. Mr Robb has also moved to set up clinical trials simultaneously in Japan, Europe and the US for Wellcome's new herpes treatment, known as 256. Previously such trials were carried out consecutively, leading to long gaps between approval in each market. Project teams have been established to anticipate potential delays with the regulatory authorities. Mr Robb's hope is that 256 could be rolled out into the world's three largest market's - the US, Japan and Europe - within 72 months. It took 11 years to obtain all Zovirax's licences. In spite of Mr Robb's efforts, weaknesses remain. Wellcome's corporate tax rate, for example, is relatively high because it has not moved parts of its manufacturing base to countries such as Singapore and Puerto Rico, which have liberal tax regimes. The group pays 36.5 per cent of its profits in tax, in contrast to Glaxo's 28 per cent and Merck's 26 per cent. S G Warburg said in its circular that it expects Wellcome's tax burden to increase by 1 percentage point this year. Another concern is Retrovir, Wellcome's anti-HIV drug. Its patent is being challenged by Barr Laboratories, a US generics group which is seeking to market its own version of the drug. 'Wellcome's case is technically strong, but the case will be decided by a North Carolina jury next year,' said Mr Plag at County Natwest. 'Both Retrovir and Aids are emotive issues and the outcome is by no means certain. If Wellcome loses, the group's earnings growth could fall significantly after 1994.' Although the drug has a high name recognition, it represents only 14 per cent of group sales. Robert Fleming's Mr Banks will have to wait until July 24 when the offer closes to see whether his optimism is justified. As Mr Robb jets round the world his marketing skills are likely to be much in demand. Despite the questions surrounding Wellcome's long-term growth, they are likely to ensure the issue succeeds.
19920626000000000	FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology: New era looks to mind drugs - In the second article of a series on drug research, Clive Cookson outlines treatments for mental conditions from anxiety to memory loss. The pharmaceutical industry has an abysmal record in treating disorders of the brain and nervous system. While new drugs have transformed the outlook for people suffering from infectious illnesses, heart disease, and gastro-intestinal problems, most psychiatric patients depend on medicines discovered several decades ago. Current treatments for mental conditions, from mild anxiety to severe psychosis, emerged during the 'black box' era of drug discovery. Doctors observed that they relieved symptoms - often poorly and unpredictably - but pharmacologists had no idea how they worked. For the most serious problems - degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's - there is still nothing that really works. The outlook, however, is much brighter, as scientific discoveries about the chemistry and biology of the brain find their way into new drugs. The ones being introduced during the 1990s are based on an understanding of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers which send signals between cells) and receptors (protein molecules on the cell which receive the signals and initiate specific biological responses). After the year 2000, there is the prospect of far superior treatments based on the genetic processes involved in mental disorders. The best known neurotransmitter is 5-HT, also called 5-hyroxytryptamine or serotonin, which is active not only in the brain but also in other parts of the body. It is associated with several types of receptor, each giving a different biological response. The pharmaceutical industry is developing drugs to interact with each specific type, as an agonist to stimulate the receptor or as an antagonist to block it. Glaxo of the UK has been investigating 5-HT systems for almost 20 years and expects a spectacular payback from two drugs: sumatriptan and ondansetron. Sumatriptan (trade name Imigran) is the first effective treatment for migraine, the intense recurrent headache suffered by at least one adult in 12. It was launched last year as an injection and is being introduced in the UK this month in more convenient form as pills. With sumatriptan ahead of competition, its potential sales are huge - more than Pounds 1bn a year - if it can overcome doctors' fear of side effects. Sumatriptan is an agonist for the 5-HT1 category of receptor, stimulating the uptake of 5-HT in the cranial blood vessels. That reverses the swelling which triggers a migraine attack. Glaxo had hoped sumatriptan would have no effect elsewhere in the body but experience shows that some patients feel tightness in the chest after injections. That is presumably because blood vessels elsewhere in the body contain a few of the same 5-HT1 receptors. Glaxo says sumatriptan's side effects are insignificant for healthy people but they show how difficult it is to make a selective receptor-based drug. Ondansetron (Zofran) is an antagonist for a different receptor type, the 5-HT3. It was launched two years ago as an anti-emetic to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by cancer therapy, but Glaxo is now carrying out clinical trials with ondansetron for a range of psychiatric conditions including anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and age-associated memory impairment. Glaxo researchers are understandably cautious about proclaiming ondansetron to be a psychiatric wonder-drug. They blanch when outsiders talk of it as a potential 'smart drug' which could improve everyone's memory. Mike Tyers, pharmacology director for Glaxo Group Research, says the 5-HT3 receptors on neurones (nerve cells in the brain) 'seem to be there to control things when they go wrong.' When everything is working properly, 'they are fairly silent.' If so, a 5-HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron may help to restore the balance in several disorders, without side-effects. Another group of new drugs based on the 5-HT system is leading to improved treatments for depression. The specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as they are known, increase the low 5-HT levels in the brain which are associated with many forms of depression. Eli Lilley of the US is already selling more than Dollars 1bn a year of its pioneering SSRI, fluoxetine (Prozac) launched in 1988. In hot pursuit is a second generation of SSRIs led by paroxetine (Seroxat), which was developed jointly by Novo Nordisk of Denmark and SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group. SSRIs have fewer side effects than the 'tricyclic' drugs which have dominated antidepressant treatment for 30 years. Yet SSRIs still leave much to be desired: they take at least two weeks to relieve depression and they fail to work in about one third of patients. That may reflect partly the poor quality of clinical diagnosis in depression and other non-acute mental disorders. Some scientists believe that all forms of depression ultimately work through a common biochemical pathway. If they are right - and not everyone agrees with the theory - it may eventually be possible to find a fast-acting drug that will help anyone who is clinically depressed. The greatest neurological challenge for pharmaceutical research is to find a cure for the degenerative brain diseases which lead inexorably to dementia and death. The most prevalent is Alzheimer's, which affects as many as 20 per cent of people over 70. The search for an Alzheimer's treatment has led to a new class of drugs, the nootropics, developed to enhance memory and other cognitive functions. The first generation of nootropics aims to increase the amount of acetylcholine in the brain. Alzheimer's patients have a marked deficit of this neurotransmitter. Most of the Alzheimer's drugs developed recently work indirectly by inhibiting an enzyme called cholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine. They include piracetam from UCB of Belgium; oxiracetam from SmithKline Beecham; tacrine from Warner-Lambert of the US; and physostigmine from Forest Laboratories of the US. Although they have shown promise in clinical trials, the manufacturers have not yet produced evidence strong enough to convince the US Food and Administration to licence any of the drugs. Du Pont Merck, the pharmaceutical joint venture between Du Pont and Merck of the US, has a promising anti-dementia drug now in late clinical trials which works in a different way. It acts directly to stimulate the release of acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters in the brain. The drug (chemical name linopirdine) is noteworthy too for its unusually vivid and appealing trade name - Aviva. However none of these memory enhancing drugs, even Aviva, can do more than temporarily reverse or slow down the mental degeneration that is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. None prevents the build-up of tangled plaques of amyloid protein, which progressively destroy patients' brains. The best long-term hope for curing progressive dementias is to identify the genetic mechanism responsible and then develop drugs to block its effect. In the case of Alzheimer's, a fault in a gene coding for amyloid precursor protein (APP) seems to be responsible. In a few families, this is inherited but it is more often caused by environmental factors. Many pharmaceutical researchers are now working on long-range projects to block APP, though they are hampered by the fact that there is not yet a good animal model for Alzheimer's. Athena Neurosciences of California is one of the biotechnology companies furthest advanced in this area. More futuristic still are ideas for repairing brain damage by growing new nerve cells. That does not normally occur in an adult brain but scientists are accumulating evidence that selective regeneration could be achieved by removing some of the genetic factors that inhibit the process. The series will continue next month by looking at asthma drugs.
19920731000000000	FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Pharmaceuticals division entering flat period after decade of success. IF ICI Bioscience were demerged this year, it would account for 31 per cent of the group's sales - and 70 per cent of its profits and research spending. ICI Bio will take the fast-growing, science-based businesses that have propped up ICI's fortunes during the recession of the last two years. The international company closest in shape to ICI Bio is Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, which is also dominated by a large and profitable pharmaceutical business and a large and less profitable agrochemical business, with a scattering of smaller specialist chemical activities. Monsanto of the US and Sandoz of Switzerland are other international chemical groups with a biological orientation similar to ICI Bio. The pharmaceutical division was ICI's most successful operation in the last decade. It has not only shared in the general prosperity of the international drugs industry but also contributed some best-sellers of its own, particularly to treat heart disease and cancer. However, most analysts believe the current, rapid growth of ICI Pharmaceuticals is over. Indeed, the half-yearly results announced yesterday show that drug sales and profits are up only marginally on 1991. The best that Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI chief operating officer, could say was: 'We continue to expect pharmaceuticals to perform over the whole year at a level approaching that of last year.' Pharmaceutical sales are suffering from the expiry last year of US patent protection on Tenormin, ICI's best-selling heart drug. Already 30 per cent of Tenormin prescriptions have been replaced by its cheaper generic version, atenolol. ICI did at least expect to lose Tenormin revenues. This year's unexpected blow was the withdrawal, because of side-effects, of Temafloxacin, the antibiotic which the company licensed from Abbott of the US in order to fill a gap in its product line. On the positive side, sales of ICI's three newest drugs - Zestril (heart), Zoladex (cancer) and Diprivan (anaesthetic) - are all up by more than a third this year. And Dr Tom McKillop, technical director of ICI Pharmaceuticals, says the company has 'a very strong portfolio' of drugs at various stages of development, with about 10 in clinical trials. These could give ICI Pharmaceuticals a new burst of growth in the late 1990s after a relatively flat period. However successful the new drugs are, ICI Bio may find it difficult to keep the pharmaceuticals business running independently as a medium-sized player in an increasingly competitive global industry. ICI is only number 17 in the world league of drug companies in terms of sales. Analysts predict it will have to link up with a competitor - through merger, acquisition or a comprehensive global alliance - in order to maintain strength in research, development and marketing. Last year there was speculation about an ICI-Wellcome combination, which would make strategic sense, and both the recent Wellcome share sale and proposed demerger of ICI Bio would make this easier. Although restructuring is on the agenda for the international pharmaceutical business, it is a more urgent priority for the agrochemicals industry in which ICI is the world's second largest player after Ciba-Geigy. Curbs on agricultural production, especially in Europe, are reducing sales of farm chemicals and leading to overcapacity. ICI Agrochemicals has a strong scientific and marketing base but its prospects do not look bright. ICI Seeds is still a much smaller business than agrochemicals but it has better growth prospects. The company is developing a range of genetically engineered seeds for crops ranging from non-squashy tomatoes to herbicide-resistant corn. Other promising ICI Bio businesses include Quorn, the fungal food, and Biopol, a biodegradable plastic made by bacteria.
19920729000000000	FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: British Bio-technology loss doubles to Pounds 11.6m. BRITISH Bio-technology, the recently floated pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported losses before tax for the year ended April 30 almost doubled from Pounds 6.13m to Pounds 11.6m. Mr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, said the results were in line with expectations. Product research and development expenditure was likely to increase from about Pounds 11.5m in 1991 to about Pounds 15m this year, he said. This would lead to losses about 50 per cent higher for the current year. Losses per share increased from 34.9p to 44.9p. The company is not paying a dividend. Net cash outflow was Pounds 12m (Pounds 10m), partly because of increased spending. However, revenues fell from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.1m. Mr McCullagh said this followed a decision to push through more research to the development stage, allowing the company to generate more substantial revenues at a later date. The balance sheet remained strong with cash reserves of more than Pounds 37m at the year end, he said. This had been increased to Pounds 60m following the flotation, and would allow the group to extend its clinical trial programme. Mr McCullagh said the group's strategy was to sell the marketing rights for medicines that would be prescribed by general practitioners, but keep the UK and possibly European rights for products to be sold into hospitals. These drugs required smaller, less expensive, sales forces. British Bio-technology would be looking to sign a co-development and marketing deal, late this year or early next year, with a significant pharmaceuticals company for its Aids vaccine. The drug has completed phase I safety trials on healthy volunteers and the group is hoping to establish its efficacy with further trials.
19920723000000000	FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (5): Companies focus on new drugs and more research - Japan's drugs industry. MOUNTING worries over international expansion by Japan's pharmaceutical industry - following their counterparts in the vehicle and electronics industries - have been calmed by slower-than-expected results by the overseas operations of the drugs groups. However, the Japanese pharmaceuticals industry is at a turning point, as companies are shifting focus towards production of new and effective drugs and boosting research and development. Compared to their western counterparts, Japanese drugs companies have operated on a smaller scale, focusing on the domestic market, the second-largest in the world with annual sales of Y6,000bn. The companies traditionally relied on small-step innovations of existing drugs, mainly lower-value antibiotics and vitamins. However, a decline in profitability of domestic operations, brought about by recent reforms by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, has forced companies to shift emphasis on R&D in order to create world-beating innovatory products. Until recently, Japanese drug companies have been complacent about R&D because of the government's drug-pricing policy, where all new drugs were awarded premium prices whether or not they were dramatic improvements. Companies, lacking the incentive to develop innovative drugs, chose only to make small changes to existing drugs rather than spend big sums on product development. Companies also relied on profit margins from the distribution of drugs supplied by foreign companies under licence for the Japanese market. The push by the government for new and effective drugs has been prompted by a change in pricing rules. From this fiscal year, the only drugs to be allowed premium prices will be those which represent a new concept, are more effective than existing drugs and which make a noticeable contribution to treatment. Profits at companies lacking new products have been squeezed by the government's official price cuts implemented every two years from 1981 and averaging from 10 to 15 per cent. The cuts are applying pressure on companies to produce new drugs because the impact on the profit margins of new drugs is less severe. In addition, foreign drug companies have started to terminate distribution tie-ups as they establish their own networks in Japan, reducing commissions for the former Japanese partners. As companies increase R&D and capital investment spending, the need to establish a worldwide presence in order to recoup costs has increased sharply. Japanese companies also say that market share in Japan has hit a ceiling. 'Profits have reached upward limits,' says Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, Japan's third-largest with sales of Y227bn. R&D expenditure has doubled during the past 10 years while net sales increased by only 50 per cent during the same period. The percentage of R&D expenses to net sales rose to 11.1 per cent in the last fiscal year from 7.2 per cent in fiscal 1982. Because a typical drug takes 10 years and Y10bn to develop, only those companies large enough to absorb costs will be able to survive in the long run. 'Companies without strong R&D pipelines and new innovative products will drift sideways,' says Mr John Wilson, analyst at James Capel in Tokyo. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, one of the most aggressive in international expansion, admits that it will take another 10 years before the company becomes truly global. Fujisawa is also increasing production and marketing capacity in the US and Europe ahead of the launch of FK-506, an immune system suppressor used to prevent transplant patients rejecting new organs. Japanese drugs makers are currently boosting efforts to build comprehensive and independent operations in R&D, production and marketing. However, compared with the large-scale mergers and acquisitions in the US and Europe, the purchases and joint ventures have been modest in size. Mr Thomas Hofstaetter, executive managing director at Hoechst Japan, says there is a lack of candidates for acquisitions by Japanese companies. 'The targets are often expensive and it is not economical,' he explains. Meanwhile, the sharp decline in asset values in Japan, bought on by the slump in the stock and property markets, have made small and medium-sized Japanese drugs companies ideal targets for global pharmaceutical groups looking to expand in Japan. The country's market holds substantial potential for further growth as the population ages rapidly and consumers become increasingly health-conscious. Corporate financiers point out that the smaller companies, unable to survive through the industry's consolidation due to the lack of financial and R&D resources, are receptive to cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Pfizer, the US drugs and chemicals group, announced plans to buy Koshin Medical, a privately-owned medical equipment distributor earlier this year. Last year, Monsanto of the US acquired 12 per cent of Hokuriku Pharmaceuticals for Y14.5bn. Mergers and acquisitions among Japanese companies, including rescues of smaller companies, are also expected to increase. But Mr John Wilson at James Capel predicts that alliances between industry leaders to create larger pharmaceuticals groups would be unlikely due to lingering negative attitudes towards M&A among Japanese companies.
19920723000000000	FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (6): Prices continue to be a big issue - Marjorie Shaffer examines developments in the US. THE US pharmaceutical industry prospered mightily in the go-go years of the 1980s. Profit margins widened and revenue growth marched steadily and reliably upwards. But no one expects a repeat performance in the 1990s amid continuing pressure from Washington, patient advocacy groups and insurance companies to slow the rise in prescription drug prices. Over the past decade, the industry habitually raised the price of prescription drugs in the US at least twice or three times the rate of inflation. The steep price increases contributed to hefty double-digit profit gains of 17-20 per cent. But because of the pressure to limit price increases, most analysts agree that annual profit gains will slow to 13-15 per cent by 1995. Some analysts even predict that overall industry earnings growth could dip below 10 per cent. Whatever the numbers eventually turn out to be, heavy criticism of US prescription drugs is forcing the industry to act with more restraint. Pharmaceutical giant Merck said last year it would not raise prices more than the rate of inflation and other companies, including Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, have followed suit. 'I think there is less pricing flexibility than in the past,' said a spokesman for Warner-Lambert, a New Jersey-based drug company which has announced that its price increases will be 'reasonable'. The pressure to stem the rise in drug prices is apparently taking a toll already in some areas. Earlier this year, drug companies reported below par first-quarter results, leading to a sell-off on Wall Street. The first quarter is when the industry usually puts through its annual price raises. This year, price increases were halved to 5-6 per cent from the 10-12 per cent typical of the past five years. Analysts say continuing pricing constraints will hurt companies without strong product pipelines. Upjohn, a drugs company based in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that many analysts say lacks a strong research and development pipeline, has announced that it expects its second-quarter net income to be flat. It said it was offering voluntary retirement to about 10 per cent of its workforce to reduce costs. Bristol-Meyers Squibb surprised Wall Street last month when it released a disappointing second-quarter earnings forecast. While price increases have apparently moderated, Americans still pay some of the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In most other countries, prices are subsidised by governments that negotiate with drugs companies, but drugs companies in the US have long set their own prices. Elderly consumers bear the brunt of the costs, according to a study by Purdue University's Pharmaceutical Economics Research Center in Layfayette, Indiana. The Purdue study estimates that the elderly account for nearly 35 per cent of retail expenditures for prescription drugs in the US. The cost of prescription drugs can be an overwhelming burden for people on fixed incomes. Senator David Pryor, chairs the Senate Special Committee on Ageing and is a critic of prescription drug prices. Earlier this year the Senate defeated a bill proposed by Senator Pryor to control pharmaceutical prices, but he intends to keep the pressure on. Some well-publicised prices for newer drugs underscore the issue. In May, cancer experts criticised Johnson & Johnson for setting too high a price for the drug Levamisole to treat colon cancer. The company set the price at Dollars 1,250 to Dollars 1,500 for a year's supply, some 100 times higher than an older version of the drug used in veterinarian medicine. Advocates for the mentally ill have attacked Swiss drug giant Sandoz for the price it has set for Clozapine, used to treat schizophrenia: Dollars 7,500 for the drug itself plus a required weekly blood monitoring. And even before the experimental cancer drug Taxol is out of clinical trials, advocates for breast cancer patients wonder if the price of the drug, which may eventually reach Dollars 2,000 a gram, will simply be out of reach of most women. The pharmaceutical industry has long justified its prices by citing huge research and development costs. According to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA), the industry's trade group in Washington, research costs will near Dollars 11bn in 1992, up from Dollars 9.6bn in 1991 and about Dollars 600m in 1970. The industry argues that it has to recoup its R&D costs. In the US, it spends a little over 16 cents out of each sales dollar for R&D, compared to 4.5 cents to 5 cents for all other industries, said Mr Jeff Trewhitt, PMA spokesman. 'Of course in nations where there are price controls, like southern Europe, the prices are lower', said Mr Trewhitt, adding that in those countries with price controls there is little biomedical innovation. 'Between 1975 and 1989, 47 major world-class drugs originated in the US alone. This innovation has been fostered in a free-market atmosphere. Certainly, the R&D costs have to be covered', said Mr Trewhitt. Despite the industry's protests, drug prices continue to be a big issue, according to analysts. 'It will stay very difficult to increase prices three times whatever the consumer price index is,' said Mr Neil Sweig, a drug analyst with Capital Institutional Services. Indeed, as the US pharmaceutical industry braces itself for a colder business climate, analysts say the near future will be filled with lower growth rates and lower share prices.
19920723000000000	FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (3): Emphasis shifts to elderly - Alan Archer assesses threats to profitability. AT a time when most of the world's industry has been undergoing a restructuring phase brought about by the recession, the pharmaceuticals industry worldwide (not accounting for the former communist bloc for which reliable sources are not yet available) has been putting forward its defensive qualities and has lived up to its description: 'almost recession-proof.' Industry executives are asking themselves, with increasing nervousness, how much longer the good times can last. Drug sales are hardly affected by the ups and downs of the economy, but how long can the drug companies continue to announce earnings growth of 15 per cent per year? According to Mr Sam Isaly, of Mehta and Isaly, New York, the world market grew 10 per cent with total sales of Dollars 165bn in 1991. The industry's annual growth rate has slowed a little over recent years but continues to exceed the rate of growth of the world economy as a whole. The past few decades have proved to be a golden era for the pharmaceutical industry but despite the rise in sales the industry is still in a transition period highlighted by the amount of consolidation taking place in the past few years. On the positive front, many in the industry feel that the underlying demand for innovative drugs to meet and satisfy medical needs will be boosted by the shift of focus towards the elderly. This is a continuing campaign run by the UK pharmaceutical industry, according to Mr Ben Hayes, spokesman for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). The impact on pharmaceuticals demand will be considerable. Using the UK as an example, drug expenditure per head in the over-65 age group is four times the level of the rest of the population. Companies which will benefit most from the changing demographic pattern will be those that provide for the chronic diseases of old age; arthritis, coronary disease, hypertension and central nervous system-related illness. Many companies are investing heavily in this latter area, particularly in research into Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The company which comes out first with a product that treats these ailments would be guaranteed spectacular sales, as Wellcome has had with its Aids treatment, Retrovir (Zidovudine). Another important issue is that of demographic changes and their impact on demand. The world population is growing rapidly - by some 17 per cent a year  -with the poorest countries growing the fastest. The less-developed regions of the world account for 76 per cent of the population and at present less than 15 per cent of pharmaceutical consumption. But many industry observers believe that this will rapidly change over the next two decades. It is thought that this demand will be satisfied by the launch of new products resulting from new technology such as molecular biology which is now producing a large quantity of new drug products based on the rational drug design. On the negative side, there are many cries from the industry forecasting reduced profitability in the next decade. There are several forces affecting this profitability: Pricing pressures from governments worldwide and also private buying organisations. Drugs are a tempting target for governments wishing to restrain soaring healthcare costs, although they represent only about 10 per cent of health spending and can save money if used sensibly. The increasing trend in generic prescribing and generic substitution means that products will lose their market share rapidly after patent expiry. This will be further highlighted by the fact that tried and tested branded products such as Tagament, Capoten and Tenormin will be included in the new generics being offered in the near future. Increasing regulatory requirements are delaying product launches and causing an erosion of patent life. In many countries, regulatory departments have a backlog of filings awaiting review. Escalating research and development costs. According to the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the most recent estimate of cost involved in developing a new drug has risen from Dollars 125m in 1987 to Dollars 245m in 1991. For several years, many drug companies had no clear policy on what therapeutic product groups and geographical areas they wanted to trade in, taking a somewhat haphazard approach. But the current consolidation process has changed all that. Pressure is building and only companies with a clear strategy on what areas they want to compete in will be successful. 'Most companies have decided where they want to be by the year 2000,' says Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at James Capel. 'Certainly Merck and Glaxo have clearly defined their role, but others like Upjohn, Warner-Lambert, Pfizer and Syntex are not completely clear what their position is.' The 1990s have brought about the need for a much greater awareness of the drugs available and the world's drug market. GPs now have a much better choice of medications for prescribing and are increasingly using computer data bases, not only for information sourcing but also the ordering of pharmaceuticals. The greater concern taken by the general public (action and lobby groups) and media to investigate wherever possible the cost benefits and safety of the drugs they are prescribed. An increasing collaboration world-wide by regulatory bodies. The globalisation of industry in the 1990s will be assisted by the standardisation of regulatory approval procedures for new drugs. As European regulations are unified after 1992, they will gradually come together with those of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The use by the FDA of European data for the investigation of Glaxo's filing of its new migraine drug, Imigran (sumatriptan), is a very good example. Launched in the UK in October 1991, the drug has been fast-tracked in the US and approval by the FDA may be imminent. The growing knowledge by competing companies of each other's R&D programmes and general strategies. Professor Horst Meyer, head of Bayer Pharmaceuticals thinks further concentration of the world's pharmaceutical industry is inevitable. The need for substantial investment in research and development required to discover 'block-buster' drugs with sales of more than Dollars 500m a year was beyond the means of all but the largest companies. Prof Meyer said the top 10 companies were spending 35 per cent of all money dedicated to pharmaceutical R&D and the proportion was likely to increase. In addition, smaller companies were handicapped by their inability to market drugs in the three largest markets - the US, Europe and Japan. The top pharmaceutical groups were able to recover their ever-larger investments by selling the drugs in all three areas, added Prof Meyer.

19920723000000000	FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (1): Shake-up is on the way - Drugs companies are concerned that they could be forced to negotiate not only the traditional hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy, but a new one  -that of cost-benefit. PHARMACEUTICAL companies have withstood the recession as though charmed. Apparently inoculated against the slowdown in the world economy, the sector has offered conspicuously impressive earnings growth. But parts of the pharmaceuticals business look sick and the prognosis for some groups is gloomy. Income growth looks set to slow while costs continue to escalate. Faced with the danger of falling returns, the sector looks set for significant restructuring, with the strong becoming stronger and the weak driven into mergers or even forced to exit. The main driving force behind the coming shake-up is increasing state interference with drug prices. Governments everywhere are trying to control rapidly expanding healthcare budgets. Ageing populations and the growing cost of health technology have led to an alarming increase in healthcare expenditure. In the US, spending on health increased between 1960 and 1991 from 5.5 per cent of GNP to 12 per cent, according to Mr Peter Lauper, head of pharma-economics at Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss group. He estimates the figure will reach 15 per cent by the end of the decade. For governments, the agony has been compounded because the burden of such increases has fallen disproportionately on the state. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of healthcare spending paid for by the US federal and state authorities has risen from 22 per cent to 41 per cent. Governments, scared by such figures but politically shy of tackling expenditure on hospitals and doctors, see drugs expenditure as an attractive target for cost savings. Most governments have attempted to achieve savings through aggressive pharmaceuticals price controls. The pace of such interference is accelerating. Last month, the German government extended its reference pricing system, setting limits for the reimbursement of certain drugs. Patients pay the balance. In Japan, the Finance Ministry launched the latest in a series of price cuts last April. In the US, political pressure from politicians has drawn blood. Last month, Mr Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said drugs companies supplying a third of the US market had promised voluntarily to keep price increases at or below the rate of inflation. As price controls start to bite, so growth in the world pharmaceuticals market will decelerate. Wellcome, the British group, estimates that between 1985 and 1990, the world drugs market increased on average by 13 per cent a year. For the five years after 1995 that figure could fall to only 5 per cent, it believes. Others believe the figure could be about 9 per cent. The other force driving change is the rapidly rising cost of research and development. The industry spends about Dollars 26bn at present. In the US, R&D expenditure was Dollars 11bn in 1992, up from Dollars 9.6bn in 1991 and about Dollars 600m in 1970. Dr Armin Kessler, president of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations, has warned that even the existing level of expenditure is unsustainable. It is in this context of rising costs and slowing growth that pharmaceuticals groups and the drugs divisions of almost all the big chemicals companies are trying to expand. But the industry cannot accommodate them all, warns Mr David Alcraft, director of healthcare and pharmaceuticals at PA Consulting Group. Competition is increasing. In the UK, for example, there were 28 per cent more drugs on the market in 1990 than in 1980, according to Mr Martyn Postle, a consultant at Coopers & Lybrand. With slowing revenue growth and increasing costs, the industry's return on capital is bound to fall, warns Mr Postle. He argues the sector is on the threshold of a significant shakeout. In 1989, half of world sales were in the hands of 25 companies. He believes that by the end of the decade that figure will be 15. The impact of the slowdown will fall unevenly. Those companies that have previously been able to offset a lack of new products by increasing prices will prove most vulnerable. Analysts believe US companies such as Warner Lambert and Upjohn have been highly dependent on price increases for revenue growth. Those that survive must be doubly strong. First they must create innovative products that can command premium prices. Then they must have the necessary marketing networks to exploit them fully. Creating such innovative products is far from easy. Discovering new chemical entities is fairly simple. The difficult part is identifying which ones are likely to provide competitive advantage through greater safety or efficacy. Mr Lauper at Ciba-Geigy explains: 'The essential component is quality of spend. You have to learn to manage the pipeline, accelerating development of selected compounds so you can reach the market more quickly, while at the same time remaining ethical - in other words not cutting corners.' In the battle to demonstrate the extent to which a drug is innovative, pharmaceuticals groups are adding a new weapon to their armoury: health economics. In order to guarantee premium prices for innovative products, the drugs groups are looking to demonstrate the cost-benefit of new compounds. 'Previously you just had to demonstrate the drug's quality, efficacy and safety. Now you have to show it is cost-effective,' says Mr Lauper. The industry, for the most part, welcomes the opportunity. Some benefits are easily demonstrated. SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet and Glaxo's Zantac both allow stomach ulcers to be treated at home rather than using expensive, potentially dangerous, surgery. However, there is concern that drugs companies could be forced to negotiate not only the traditional hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy, but a new fourth - that of cost-benefit. The danger is that regulatory authorities, currently only concerned with the safety, quality and efficiency of drugs, will in future only licence medicines that also demonstrate they can save costs elsewhere. Meanwhile, marketing will continue to be vital. Drugs groups will need access to worldwide marketing forces so they can maximise sales during the short period when the drug's patents remain valid, says Mr Postle. Several groups have been been able to increase their revenues significantly by setting up joint-marketing agreements. Wellcome, for example, has agreements to market Zovirax, its anti-viral medicine, with Hoechst in Germany, Sigma Tau in Italy and Sumitomo in Japan. Some small companies should be able to survive by creating niches, either in research, using new technologies, or in marketing in specific therapeutic or geographical areas, says Mr Alcraft. The main losers will be those caught in the middle, he warns. Without sufficient critical mass in research and development, they will have few compounds and little experience in negotiating the necessary regulatory hurdles. In addition, they will have increasing difficulty attracting good researchers. Mr Alcraft explains: 'The problem for the medium-sized players is that emotionally it is difficult to admit you aren't going to be the next giant. The option of being a niche operator is open, but it's a tricky decision to make.' One solution for smaller organisations is to set up joint ventures to share the costs of marketing and to increase revenues that will offset massive expenditure on research and development. Otherwise, one option for such groups is to merge. The main synergies appear to be that marketing reach is extended and that cost-savings are achieved by rationalising headquarters costs. The pace of change is likely to prove variable. Many pharmaceuticals companies are parts of larger chemicals groups. In the short term, most main boards will be unwilling to give up their high-performing pharmaceuticals divisions. But in the long term, pharmaceuticals groups must gain critical mass, find niche areas of specialisation or wither.
19920723000000000	FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (2): The challenge; speed invention and curb costs - R&D. PHARMACEUTICAL laboratories come in many shapes and sizes. Grandest of all is the Pounds 500m research centre now under construction for Glaxo in Stevenage, 30 miles north of London. The Glaxo labs - said to be largest building project in the UK after the Channel Tunnel - will house 1,400 researchers when they open in 1994. Having so many scientists working together on one site gives them all access to the best possible range of expensive up-to-date equipment. There is a danger, however, that bureaucracy will smother the imaginative approach that is essential for developing innovative drugs. Glaxo will try to overcome this by clever research management, to make the scientists feel they are working in small units. The opposite school of thought - that research flourishes best in genuinely small groups - is illustrated by Scotia Pharmaceuticals, an emerging UK company which specialises in drugs based on essential fatty acids. Scotia has no more than 170 employees altogether. Yet it carries out research and development on six widely separated sites: at Callanish on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Dundee on the east coast of Scotland, Carlisle in north-west England, Writtle in Essex, Guildford in Surrey and Nova Scotia in Canada. Dr Iain Law who is in charge of R&D at Callanish - surely the most remote pharmaceutical laboratory in Europe - says he keeps in good touch with the other facilities through visits from colleagues and through the weekly notes written by all Scotia R&D managers and circulated around the company. All pharmaceutical labs, whatever their size and location, face a common challenge: how to restrain the soaring costs of R&D and at the same time speed up the discovery and development of new drugs. According to data collected by the Centre for Medicines Research in the UK, worldwide spending on pharmaceutical R&D increased by an average of 16 per cent a year during the 1980s. The global total reached Dollars 24bn in 1990; 15 per cent of pharmaceutical sales. Almost half of the industry's R&D expenditure is in Europe, 36 per cent in the US and 15 per cent in Japan. Unfortunately the rapid rise in R&D spending has not produced a corresponding increase in the flow of new drugs onto the market. The number of medicines launched during the early 1980s averaged about 60 per year. During the three years 1989-91 it was close to 40 a year. The number of new drugs originating in Europe has fallen over the decade from 30-40 a year to 10-20 a year.) The total time taken to develop each new drug has increased steadily since the 1960s. The clinical phase - testing the drug on human patients - doubled during the 1980s to reach an average of seven years. Trials are taking longer because regulatory authorities are requiring more and more clinical data, while doctors and their patients are becoming more reluctant to take part. Companies are having to spend more time and money to recruit the hundreds or even thousands of people they require to test each drug. The industry is responding in two main ways: lobbying the authorities to reduce the regulatory burden, and operating its R&D effort more efficiently. One way to ease the regulatory burden is to harmonise requirements around the world, so that companies do not have to repeat tests unnecessarily to satisfy authorities in different countries. This is already happening within Europe through the EC. On a global level, the first international conference on harmonisation in Brussels last November was an important step toward bringing the US, Japan and Europe into line. It was agreed then, for example, that routine 12-month toxicity tests on animals should be abandoned in favour of six-month studies. But much more needs to be done, particularly to harmonise clinical requirements. Complete standardisation is unattainable because medical practice and social conditions vary so much around the world. The ultimate objective is to retain only those differences that can be justified by rational criteria. At the same time companies are trying to improve the productivity of their researchers, particularly in the pre-clinical phase which they can control more closely than clinical trials. They are investing heavily in new technology - ranging from computerised chemical databases to molecular modelling graphics and automatic gene sequencing machines - to help the scientists select and adapt compounds more rapidly for drug development. Besides introducing new technology, the industry is changing the way it manages R&D. A good UK example is ICI Pharmaceuticals. 'We have redesigned our approach to get the fastest possible answer to the question: Does the drug behave in humans in the way we would predict from our laboratory models?' says Dr Tom McKillop, technical director. ICI is now consistently achieving its target of administering candidate drugs to human volunteers within 14 months of their first synthesis - a great improvement on the company's previous average performance of 30 months. At the same time, ICI is being much more ruthless in abandoning compounds that do not live up to their initial promise. Dr McKillop says the new regime is quite different to ICI's traditional approach which 'assumed that every drug was going to succeed.'
19920721000000000	FT  21 JUL 92 / Technology: Fresh water in the gene pool / Exploring the role which genetic drugs will play in curing diseases at their source. An entirely new generation of drugs that acts directly on human genes is likely to transform the pharmaceutical industry over the next two decades. Genetic drug sales could be worth tens of billions of dollars a year within 20 years. Almost every drug today acts on proteins, the chemicals that do the work in all living creatures from viruses to people. But the rapid expansion of genetic knowledge has made it possible to target drugs at the original cause of trouble, the genes that tell cells exactly which proteins to make. Already scientists know the sequence and function of thousands of genes in humans and other animals, plants and micro-organisms, and they expect within 15 years to have discovered all of the estimated 100,000 genes which provide the blueprint for every human being. Genetic drugs can be aimed either at defective genes in the patient's own cells or at infectious organisms such as viruses. They promise cures for diseases that are hard to treat with existing medicines. And their 'exquisite specificity', to use a favourite phrase of biotechnologists, will avoid the side-effects of today's protein-based drugs. There are two broad categories of genetic drug, both just beginning clinical trials: Gene therapy involves inserting new genes into cells to produce therapeutic proteins in the body. Anti-sense therapy or code blocking is the opposite process - switching off genes so that they stop making harmful proteins. A common view in the biotechnology industry last year was that anti-sense had more commercial potential than gene therapy, at least for the medium term, because it is in principle a simpler process. A specific gene can be switched off by a molecule small enough to be made by orthodox chemical synthesis. Gene therapy, on the other hand, requires a whole new gene - thousands of times larger than an anti-sense drug - which has to be made by biotechnology. There also appeared to be immense problems in delivering new genes to the cells where they are needed and getting them to work there. Over the last few months anti- sense research has continued to make progress. Isis Pharmaceuticals of California has started clinical trials of an anti-sense drug to treat human papilloma virus (which causes genital warts and cervical cancer), and several other US companies specialising in anti-sense technology - including Genta, Gilead, Hybridon and TargeTech - are developing drugs aimed at a wide variety of diseases. Their targets include: viral infections such as hepatitis B, Aids and herpes; leukaemia and other cancers; and inflammatory disorders. But gene therapy is moving forward even faster, on both the scientific and the commercial fronts, and the view emerging in the pharmaceutical industry is that it will eventually be more important than anti-sense technology. Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) carried out the first human gene therapy trial in September 1990 on a four-year-old girl, who had to be kept apart from other children because one defective gene in her immune system meant that she had no natural protection against infection. Every month since then she has received a transfusion of about a billion of her own blood cells to which copies of the correct gene had been added (the treatment has to be repeated because the genetically engineered cells gradually die). Her immune defences are now strong enough for her to attend school normally. That success had led to a flood of proposals for gene therapy experiments in the US, where the clinical development of genetic medicine is well ahead of Europe and Japan. The American regulators have already approved about 20 clinical trials and, as with anti-sense, start-up companies are rushing to exploit the technology. Therapy Inc (GTI), based in Maryland near NIH and enjoying a close relationship with the pioneering gene therapy researchers there. Others include Somatix Therapy, Viagene, Targeted Genetics, Trans-karyotic Therapies and Vical. The range of treatments proposed for gene therapy is even wider than for anti-sense. They fall into two main categories: Replacing faulty or missing human genes. Candidates for treatment in the near future include inherited single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis and haemophilia. Eventually it may be possible to treat combinations of genetic faults - with heart disease and degenerative brain disease the most valuable targets. Giving the patient's own cells the ability to produce a therapeutic protein that is not normally present in the body. This has potential for treating many forms of cancer. Even after the rapid progress of the last few years, however, researchers still have to overcome several technical problems if gene therapy and anti-sense are to become mass market treatments. Most important of all is to develop better ways of enabling the genetic therapeutics to reach the cells where they are needed. The first generation of anti-sense drugs is not designed to reach difficult sites inside the body. Genta is applying them to bone marrow cells removed temporarily from the body (to switch off a cancer-causing gene in leukaemia), and Isis is targeting viral genes in herpes or papilloma infections on or near the skin. All the early gene therapy trials use genetically engineered viruses to insert new genes into the patient's cells. Although the virus is disabled to prevent it causing any harm, researchers cannot rule out the slight risk that it might stimulate a latent infection or even trigger cancer. But new delivery systems are in prospect for both categories of genetic treatment. Anti-sense drugs are being linked to other chemicals which make them permeate cells more effectively, and non-viral vectors are being developed for gene therapy. Until recently the established pharmaceutical giants had left gene-based medicine to academic scientists and biotechnology start-ups. They are now scrambling to catch up, by starting research in-house and forming alliances with the specialist biotech companies. Isis, for example, has partnerships with Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, Eisai of Japan and Rhone-Poulenc of France. Gilead, its competitor, has a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo of the UK. GTI is working with Sandoz of Switzerland - which has shown more interest in gene therapy than any other large pharmaceutical company. Researchers talk of total sales of genetic drugs running into tens of billion of dollars within 20 years, though such estimates are highly speculative. Robertson, Stephens & Co, Californian investment analysts, say the US gene therapy market for just three cancers (renal, ovarian and melanoma) is potentially worth Dollars 1.2bn a year - based on a cost of Dollars 15,000 per patient. That seems expensive but it may be an acceptable price for a treatment which saves not only the patient's life but also tens of thousands of dollars in hospital fees.
19920702000000000	FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Healthy market for pharmaceuticals - The growing accessibility of Japan's drugs sector. AFTER years of sitting in the back seat, the world's leading pharmaceutical companies operating in Japan have started to gain presence in what used to be one of the most introverted sectors in the country. Until recently, Japanese drug companies had the market virtually to themselves, with imports accounting for less than 10 per cent of total sales. However, recent falls in asset values, along with industry restructuring, have created chances for international drug companies to expand their Japanese operations. The country's drugs market, the second-largest in the world after the US with annual sales of Y6,000bn (Dollars 47bn), holds substantial potential for further growth as the population ages rapidly and Japanese consumers become increasingly health-conscious. Mr Thomas Hofstaetter, executive managing director at Hoechst Japan, says: 'For a pharmaceutical company to be truly global, it must maintain presence in US, Europe and Japan.' However, until recently, most foreign companies, lacking distribution networks, were forced to rely on tie-ups with Japanese companies. Although acquisitions by leading foreign companies date back as far as 1983, when Merck of the US purchased 55 per cent of Banyu Pharmaceutical, a medium-sized listed company, such cases were rare. The recent fall in the stock and real estate markets have triggered activity among foreign drugs companies. Earlier this year, Pfizer, the US drugs and chemicals group, announced plans to buy Koshin Medical, a privately-owned medical equipment distributor, for an estimated Y3bn. Last year, Monsanto of the US acquired 12 per cent of Hokuriku Pharmaceuticals for Y14.5bn, and Roussel Medica merged with Morishita Pharmaceuticals. Other leading European drug groups have also shown interest in purchasing Japanese companies. Bankers point out that some smaller Japanese drug makers and wholesalers are welcoming foreign drug companies which have comparative advantages over their Japanese counterparts. The price cuts by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, implemented every two years from 1981 and averaging from 10 to 15 per cent, have squeezed profits at drug manufacturers. The small and medium-sized companies, which lack new innovative drugs, face increasing difficulties. Japanese drug wholesalers have also been forced to change their business strategies because of to the price cuts. In the past, the manufacturer and wholesaler had special keiretsu - corporate grouping - type relationships. However, the price cuts are continually depressing profit margins, and wholesalers now need to distribute a wide range of products, rather than those of just one manufacturer. Last April, Japan's Fair Trade Commission banned manufacturers and distributors from manipulating drug prices, and that has also broken their cozy relationship. Mr Kenji Wakamatsu, at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, says: 'Since wholesalers have more freedom it's much easier for foreign companies to establish ties.' Foreign companies that entered the Japanese market early have started to set up their own sales and marketing operations. Sandoz, which entered the market in the 1960s through a distribution tie-up with Sankyo, the second-largest Japanese drugs maker, set up its own distribution network in 1990. Bayer also ended its sales tie-up with Takeda, the industry leader, in 1990. Mr Hofstaetter at Hoechst says the key to success is to have a number of strong products. Bayer's Adalaat, a calcium antagonist, posted sales of over Y50bn last year, becoming the second best-selling drug in Japan. Nippon Roche's Furtulon, an anti-cancer agent, is also seeing brisk sales. Mr John Wilson, pharmaceutical analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, says: 'Japan is a profitable market for foreign companies, since they already have effective drugs and do not need to spend a fortune on research and development.' Many foreign companies are in final stages of setting up full operations with production, sales, and research and development. Bayer is investing Y20bn in its new research centre, while Sandoz expanded its production plant north of Tokyo and expects its new Y15bn research laboratory to be completed next year. In contrast to foreign car and electronics makers, foreign drug companies, which hold about 20 per cent of the market, say they are treated equally with the Japanese. One problem which remains is clinical testing for new drugs, where foreign companies must present data from clinical trials in Japan. However, the Ministry of Health and Welfare is loosening its grip as more Japanese companies venture abroad, and with some drugs, overseas data from pre-clinical tests are accepted.  --------------------------------------------------- TOP TEN FOREIGN DRUG COMPANIES IN JAPAN  ---------------------------------------------------                      1991 sales     %  change                         (Ybn)         on year  --------------------------------------------------- Banyu (Merck)           105.1          +4.8 Bayer                    91.2          +7.8 Hoechst Japan            77.1          +3.6 Sandoz                   75.4          -2.8 Scherling                59.3          +6.5 Pfizer                   57.5         +14.1 Ciba Geigy               50.5          +1.3 Glaxo                    43.2          +4.3 ICI                      39.0          +4.3 Roche                    37.0         +14.7 Figures are as of Dec 91, except Banyu (Mar 92) and Glaxo (June 91).  --------------------------------------------------- Source: Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun; James Capel  ---------------------------------------------------
19920922000000000	FT  22 SEP 92 / Technology: Molecules muscle in / A look at a faster method of getting drugs to market. A visit to a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company these days may yield some surprises to the casual observer. The labs, complete with test tubes and scientists in goggles and white coats, are still there. Increasingly prominent, though, are computer rooms, where researchers sit in the dark looking at coloured pictures on the screen, and designing the drugs of the future. 'These new molecular design methods will become increasingly significant for the industry, and in 10 to 30 years will account for many of the new drugs on the market,' said Jaqueline Siegel, an industry analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in New York. The new method, sometimes referred to as 'second generation biotech', is really a convergence of biotechnology with more conventional molecular design. The biotech industry's traditional products are proteins for which a useful application has been discovered. But the problem with using proteins as drugs is that they are too big to get through biological barriers in the body. 'They are simply too large,' explains Joshua Boger, chief executive officer of Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Their size means they must be injected straight into the blood. If taken by mouth, they are broken down in the digestive system. Insulin, considered the first biotech product and one of the smallest proteins in existence, has a molecular weight of 7,000, compared with aspirin, which has a weight of 150. This is a particular problem because the greatest medical challenge to scientists is fighting diseases like cancer and Aids. 'Biotech products are too big to be taken orally, and if you want to treat chronic diseases, which require continuous administration, you really need an oral product,' Boger said. Scientists agree that the industry's familiarity with protein structure is invaluable in the search for useful drugs. But the new second-generation techniques require a change in philosophy in the industry. Under the new methodology, the protein is no longer thought of as a possible product; rather it is considered a target. 'What we realised is that many chronic diseases are caused by reactions of a single protein within the body,' said John Maraganore, head of biological research at Boston-based Biogen. 'So if we can design molecules that bind to the protein to somehow affect the reaction, we may have a useful drug.' Vertex is using the new method to work out a cure for the Aids-causing HIV virus. The company has discovered an empty space in the protein where a chemical process causes the virus to become active. The hope is that by plugging up that space, the molecule would simply lay dormant in the body. The product which will probably come on market first is one developed by a traditional pharmaceutical group, Merck, to prevent glaucoma. In late clinical trials, the product may be on pharmacy shelves as early as 1994. Squibb and Hoffmann-La Roche are also using second-generation molecular design techniques to come up with new drugs. '(Second-generation) is a powerful approach which is being heavily utilised in the industry,' said Peter Lomedico, senior director of molecular biology at Hoffmann-La Roche. Traditional pharmaceutical companies are approaching the new technique from a different direction than biotechnology firms. Unlike biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical groups were always in the business of looking for small molecules. The problem was that there was little method to the madness. 'Old-fashioned research methods call for years of random testing,' said Boger, who worked for many years in the pharmaceutical industry. 'What the scientists do is experiment with substances to see what works. They often use soil samples because they contain so many different compounds. If something accidentally works, they turn it into a drug.' The problem is that this method is costly and lengthy. Traditional drug discovery takes an average of seven years. And the average cost of traditional drug development is a hefty Dollars 220m (Pounds 124m) per product. 'It's trial and error with too much error,' said Boger. The aim of second-generation biotech is to get drugs on to the market faster. 'The new techniques are a lot better than the traditional grind and find approach,' said Siegel. Another problem with traditional drug development is that it creates a product which often has side-effects. 'The compound may cleave to the protein you want, but it may bind to other proteins as well,' said Boger. 'That's what causes side-effects. With new molecular design methods, we try to get as specific as possible, trying to come up with a molecule that binds to just one specific protein.' Whatever direction they are coming from, both biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are now using similar methods in the new molecular design approach. The latest techniques take advantage of a process called X-ray crystallography, which enables researchers to take a three-dimensional picture of a protein. The protein is then entered on to a computer screen, where scientists design drugs they believe will react with the target molecule. This method is sometimes referred to as 'structured rational drug design'. 'It's becoming increasingly like a recipe,' explained Maraganore. 'If you want to make the compound longer to fit on to the protein better, you add on some amino acids - shorter, and you take a few beads off. What you come up with is not something found in nature, which would be a traditional biotech product, but a unique, designed drug which binds to a specific protein.' Structured rational drug design uses both the protein expertise of the biotechnology firms and the molecular design methods of the pharmaceutical groups. For that reason, many companies find that joint projects are the best road to take. 'It's the development of this new technique, which uses the expertise of both industries, which is inspiring a lot of the partnerships now forming between biotechnology and pharmaceutical groups,' said Siegel. The latest method of drug research is just beginning to take hold in the industry, and no products developed through the technique are yet available on the market. But few doubt that it is the wave of the future. 'This is the permanent trend of the industry,' said Lomedico of Hoffmann-La Roche. 'There's no turning back now.'
19920902000000000	FT  02 SEP 92 / SmithKline plans R&D shake-up: Group to cut jobs, invest in new facilities and end research into gastro-intestinal drugs. SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-US pharmaceutical group, is to to make far-reaching changes in research and development. They involve 150 redundancies among UK research staff, a Pounds 200m investment in new R&D facilities and, most surprisingly, withdrawal from long-term research in gastro-intestinal drugs - the field that provided its best-selling product, the ulcer medicine Tagamet. The 'strategic realignment' of R&D is the final phase of cost cutting and rationalisation that followed the merger between Beecham of the UK and SmithKline Beckman of the US in 1989. Savings in manufacturing, marketing and administration have already cut the group's workforce by about 2,000 and helped raise pre-tax profits 18 per cent a year. 'Resources must be focused on drug discovery with the highest potential for return,' said Dr George Poste, R&D chairman. 'As a result SB has decided to discontinue several research programmes.' The most striking casualty is gastro-intestinal drug discovery, which led to Tagamet, with sales exceeding Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) in each of the past six years, and more recently to Kytril, the anti-nausea drug launched last year as a competitor to Glaxo's Zofran. 'We feel that basic research in this area has proceeded more slowly than in others and it's more difficult to identify rational candidates for drug discovery,' said Dr Poste. But he emphasised that development work on SB's existing gastro-intestinal compounds would continue. The realignment will leave SB with drug discovery programmes in five areas: central nervous system; heart and lungs; anti-infectives; inflammation and tissue repair; and vaccines. UK R&D sites will be cut from eight to six. SB will close its medical offices in Reigate, Surrey, and the small research facility at its antibiotics factory in Worthing, Sussex. The 150 redundancies - including scientists, technicians and office staff - will be spread across the eight sites. The Pounds 200m investment in new buildings and equipment over the next four years will concentrate on Brockham Park and Great Burgh in Surrey and Mundells in Hertfordshire. SB will continue to divide its R&D effort equally between the UK and US. Dr Poste said SB planned to devote about 15 per cent of pharmaceutical sales to R&D. This year's R&D budget is about Pounds 410m. Its A shares closed 13p down yesterday at 443p.
19921027000000000	FT  27 OCT 92 / A bitter pill to swallow: Price constraints threaten to undermine the sales and earnings of leading drugs companies. The prospect of a victory for Governor Bill Clinton in the US presidential election has hit US pharmaceuticals stocks. Since the Democratic convention in July, the shares which were the market's favourites last year have fallen by more than 10 per cent on average. The sharp decline has been prompted by fears that a Clinton administration might introduce controls on drug prices, following the lead of other countries. Ministries of health in nearly all the largest markets are planning measures to slow the growth of drugs spending through price cuts or freezes. Such pressure threatens to undermine sales and earnings growth, leading eventually to a restructuring of the world's pharmaceuticals industry. In August, for the first time, Germany's Krankenkassen - the health insurance organisations which provide cover for everyone in work - slashed the amount they were willing to pay for drugs, cutting prices on average by 5 per cent. The reductions, followed by a two-year price freeze, are part of a package that observers believe could slice drugs groups' profits in Germany, the world's third-largest market for pharmaceuticals, by a quarter. In Italy, the world's fourth-largest market, the treasury - which sets drugs prices - has refused to allow any further increases. Meanwhile, in Japan, the world's second-largest market, the ministry of health has cut drugs prices by 8 per cent on average this year. The prices of some medicines have been reduced nine times in the past 14 years. But it is in the US, the world's biggest market for pharmaceuticals and one of the last, with Denmark, in which drug prices are not set by the government, where the implications of price curbs could be most serious. Companies are already voluntarily limiting their prices in the hope of avoiding legislation, but their efforts may be too late to prevent it. The reason for worldwide pressure on prices is that healthcare budgets in almost every developed country are out of control. A combination of rising demand for care from ageing populations and increasingly expensive medical technology has sent health spending spiralling. Germany spent about 9 per cent of gross national product on healthcare in 1989 compared with 6 per cent in 1970. Last month, the German health ministry warned that the Krankenkassen could register a deficit in western Germany alone of DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) this year because the cost of healthcare would outstrip contributions. In the US, healthcare expenditure has risen from 7 per cent of GNP in 1970 to 12 per cent in 1990. Over the same period the proportion of the costs met by federal and state authorities has increased from 22 per cent to 41 per cent. The rest is paid by individuals and private health insurers. Governments, faced with such rising healthcare expenditure, have preferred to target the prices and volumes of drugs prescribed rather than trim spending on politically sensitive areas such as hospitals and doctors. The dilemma is particularly acute in the US where American congressmen threatened the industry with legislation following the publication in August of a report by the US General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The report showed that the price of some drugs (see accompanying chart) had increased by more than 200 per cent over the past six years, compared with an overall rise in the consumer price index of 26.2 per cent. Congressman Pete Stark, Californian Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means health subcommittee, said the report demonstrated there was no justification for the steep price increases in prescription drugs. He blamed 'corporate greed'. 'The drugs companies are using their monopoly status to make a killing on very sick people,' he said after the report's publication. Mr Paul Freiman, chairman of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, says the war of words over prices is partly the reason why relations between the government and the American pharmaceuticals sector is at its lowest point for 30 years. The response from global drugs groups has been defensive. They argue that, by setting their sights on prices, governments are aiming at the wrong target. 'Expanding healthcare budgets are not a drug-driven phenomenon. In the UK, the proportion of health expenditure represented by drugs has only risen from 9 per cent in 1960 to 10 per cent in 1990,' says Mr Jim Attridge, international business operations manager at ICI's pharmaceuticals division. 'That isn't much of an increase.' Expenditure on drugs accounted for 14 per cent of total US healthcare costs in 1960, according to Mr Peter Lauper, head of pharma-economics at Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland. By last year the proportion was down to 7 per cent, although overall spending on drugs was up. Over the same period, much of the rise in healthcare spending was generated by the cost of running hospitals and doctors' surgeries. Mr Lauper says expenditure on hospital staff and other costs represented 34 per cent of healthcare spending in the US in 1960, and had reached 45 per cent in 1990. Nevertheless, drugs companies admit their case is not helped by their traditionally high profit margins and returns on capital. At Glaxo, worldwide pre-tax profit margins were 31.4 per cent last year, while those of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare and consumer products company, were 25.6 per cent. Merck, the US giant and the world's largest drugs group, had margins last year of 36.8 per cent. During the fatter years of the late 1980s, such pre-tax margins attracted little attention. But while other industries' earnings have plunged during the current recession, those of the pharmaceuticals groups have been conspicuous by their strength. The industry defends its profits by arguing it needs to invest in research and development. American groups, for example, now spend about Dollars 11bn a year researching and bringing new drugs to market, compared with Dollars 4.5bn five years ago. Many diseases still have no cure, ranging from Aids to Alzheimer's. Given adequate resources, the industry claims, it can find them. More than 90 per cent of medicine discoveries are developed by the drugs industry, according to the US pharmaceutical manufacturers association. American companies discovered 47 of the top 97-selling drugs launched between 1975 and 1889. Countries with lower prices and profit margins, such as France, do not develop best-selling medicines because they do not earn enough to plough into R&D, the US industry alleges. One snag with this argument is that the industry's high margins are calculated after the costs of R&D have been deducted. In other words, the substantial profits achieved by most of the industry are banked after companies have met their R&D expenses. If they did not spend as much on R&D, their profits would be greater. American politicians have so far been unimpressed by voluntary undertakings by the industry to control its prices. Merck, Upjohn, Hoechst-Roussel, Bristol Myers Squibb, ICI and Pfizer have all introduced measures holding down some or all of their prices. So far, companies supplying a third of the US market have promised to keep price rises in line with the consumer price index, according to the industry association. In spite of such undertakings, global pressure on pricing is unlikely to disappear. The ensuing structural change, according to Mr Viren Mehta, partner at Mehta and Isalay, the New-York healthcare investment group, is producing 'a bifurcation of the industry between the haves and the have-nots'. The haves, according to Mr Mehta, are those companies with development departments which have the expertise and scale necessary to bring drugs to market quickly in the US, Europe and Japan. They also have strong marketing skills to exploit the new medicines to the full. He describes them as M&D - marketing and development - groups. Among them, he lists Merck and Pfizer of the US, and Glaxo of the UK. The have-nots are those groups with few new products and expiring patents. These weaker groups, which used to generate profit growth through price increases, have been particularly hard hit by the recent pricing constraints. In the third quarter of this year, for example, the US group Bristol Myers Squibb reported pre-tax profits growth of 5 per cent, while Upjohn's increase was only 1.4 per cent. Eli Lilly recorded a loss of Dollars 268.5m after restructuring charges. In contrast, Merck, one of the 'haves', increased earnings by 17 per cent. The polarisation of the industry could be followed by consolidation among the have-nots. Mr Martyn Postle, a pharmaceuticals industry consultant at Coopers & Lybrand, the management consultancy group, says: 'In 1989 the top 25 companies had about 50 per cent of world pharmaceuticals sales. By the end of the decade the top 15 groups will control half of the market.' Economies of scale among the leading M&D groups would allow them to reduce the proportion of turnover spent on marketing and R&D. Mr Paul Krikler, industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, the stockbroker, says leading companies could reduce their sales and general administration costs to about 25 per cent of turnover - Glaxo currently spends about 40 per cent of turnover on sales and administration. Further costs could be saved through the rationalisation of pharmaceuticals manufacturing, an area of significant over-capacity. Drugs groups have duplicated manufacturing plants, particularly in European countries, where they have used the promise of local investment to negotiate higher drugs prices from governments. Glaxo has manufacturing capacity in 42 sites in 31 countries. The cost-cutting has already started. Last week, Eli Lilly said it was spending Dollars 519.6m on restructuring its operations, including manufacturing. Syntex, a US group, also announced a restructuring plan during the same week. Through such cost-containment, some of the larger groups may become stronger global competitors. But for the weaker companies, the trend towards government-imposed price constraints in the world's main markets threatens their survival.  ------------------------------------------------------------             PHARMACEUTICALS: PRESSURE ON PRICES  ------------------------------------------------------------ Percentage wholesale price rises over six years  ------------------------------------------------------------ Tenormin (Hypertension) ICI                                               85.6%  ------------------------------------------------------------ Ventolin (Asthma) (Glaxo)                                           89.9%  ------------------------------------------------------------ Valium (Sedative) (Roche)                                           91.6%  ------------------------------------------------------------ Halcion (Sleeping pill)                          110.0% (Upjohn)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Restoril (Sleeping pill)                         134.2% (Sandoz)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Synthroid (Thyroid)                              143.0% (Boots)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Azmacort (Asthma)                                182.8% (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Coumadin (Heart)                                 218.2% Du Pont Merck)  ------------------------------------------------------------ CONSUMER PRICE INDICES  ------------------------------------------------------------ All items                                         26.2% Medical care                                      53.3% Prescription drugs                                67.0%  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: US General Accounting Office  ------------------------------------------------------------
19921215000000000	FT  15 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Patent improvement - Robert Rice explains how changes to EC regulations will affect the Community's pharmaceutical industry. It looks like being a happy new year for Europe's pharmaceutical industry: on January 2, after years of wrangling and intensive lobbying, the European Community will adopt a regulation granting up to five years' extra patent protection for drugs. The extension of the effective period of marketing exclusivity for drugs through a system of supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) is designed to give pharmaceutical companies a fair return on the growing cost of researching and developing new drugs, and to prevent research work moving from the EC to the US or Japan where drugs already enjoy extended patent protection. As with all legislation born of political compromise, however, the European SPC system is far from straightforward. The procedure for obtaining a certificate is complex. The extent to which different EC states can alter the effect of the regulation by the way they implement it threatens a bureaucratic and administrative nightmare. Generic producers and companies making patented drugs under licence face a period of uncertainty. For a long time, there has been widespread concern that necessary safety testing for new drugs imposes a heavy penalty on pharmaceutical inventions compared with other sectors of technology. Patents in Europe generally last a maximum of 20 years from the application date. But, according to Ms Patricia Harris, an intellectual property lawyer with City solicitors Lovell White Durrant, the development period for new drugs - from discovery to marketing authorisation - lasts an average of 12 years. In complex areas of research into diseases currently regarded as incurable such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis, the development time may be even longer. This means that by the time they have obtained approval to market the drug, companies have little of the patent term left in which to use their monopoly rights to recoup the increasingly heavy costs of research and development, she says. Although there has been little evidence of research migrating to the US or Japan, where patent protection is longer, or of it being abandoned, European governments accepted that it would be foolhardy to wait for signs of decline in the EC pharmaceutical industry before taking action. Consumer organisations, however, warned that extended patent protection could push up the overall drugs bill for public health services across Europe by restricting the market for generic products. But governments recognised that, far from pushing up the overall drugs bill, extended protection could be used to drive pharmaceutical prices down, says Mr Martin Paltnoi, a pharmaceuticals marketing consultant. This is because, once a reasonable period of marketing exclusivity is guaranteed, the rationale for allowing drug companies to charge high prices to recoup development costs over an uncertain and short period of patent cover no longer exists. Working out the duration of an SPC will not be easy. It will be available for the length of a drug's development period minus five years and for a maximum of five years. The development period is defined as the time between filing the patent in the EC country in which the SPC is sought and the date that it is first authorised for use in the EC as a whole. Ms Harris says this means that if the development period is five years or less no supplementary protection will be available. If the development period is between five and 10 years an SPC of up to five years will be available, and for development periods of between 10 and 20 years a full five-year SPC will apply. The procedures are also complex. A separate application will have to be made in the patent office of each member state in which supplementary protection is required. Applications will have to be filed within six months of the drug being authorised for use in the relevant country. For drugs already patented and authorised in the relevant member state on January 2 1993, transitional provisions will apply and any applications for an SPC must be filed by July 2 1993. Under the transitional provisions for SPCs, a product must generally have been first authorised for use in the EC after January 1 1985. However, Belgium, Italy, Germany and Denmark have adopted different dates, while the transitional provisions will not apply at all in Greece, Portugal and Spain, where the regulation will not come into force until 1998. To complicate matters further, the Spanish government has started proceedings in the European Court to have the regulation set aside. The changes mean an administrative headache for the national patent agencies, Mr Paltnoi believes, as they struggle to find out when and where in the EC a drug was first authorised for use in order to calculate the length of an SPC. Without a pooling of international data, accurate verification of first authorisation may prove impossible in many cases, he warns. Ms Harris warns of an uncertain period for companies producing patented drugs under licence. Licences are usually expressed to last 'for the duration of the patent'. But an SPC does not extend the patent, it simply grants additional protection. Licensees who want a continued exclusive licence to produce and market a drug under an SPC will have to renegotiate their licence agreements. The SPCs will go some way towards meeting the industry's requirements for an adequate period of patent protection in Europe, says Ms Harris. It will also be watched with interest by other industries, such as agrochemicals, which also experience problems in recouping R&D costs because of the length of time it takes to obtain marketing authorisations.
19921214000000000	FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pfizer to increase R&D. PFIZER, one of the fastest-growing US drugs groups, is to increase its annual research and development spending to more than Dollars 1bn next year. Mr Henry McKinnel, chief financial officer, said the aim was to increase the percentage of group sales from pharmaceuticals. During the first nine months of this year drugs generated 62 per cent of its Dollars 5.28bn sales compared with 54 per cent last year. Mr McKinnel said the group would limit price rises on US prescription drugs to between 2 per cent and 3 per cent in the coming year. The announcement follows growing political pressure from Congress to limit price increases. A number of other groups, including Merck, the largest US drugs company, have undertaken not to raise prices or at least limit them to the rate of inflation. The promise to increase investment in research and development by up to 20 per cent next year follows an 18 per cent rise to Dollars 756.8m in 1991. The investment is designed to help the group counter the expiry of patents.
19921117000000000	FT  17 NOV 92 / Technology: A tighter lid on the pillbox - Drug companies are toughening their approach to research and development. THE drugs industry is adopting an increasingly ruthless attitude to research and development spending, which grew fourfold over the past decade to reach an estimated Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.50bn) worldwide this year. Companies are working to reduce the interval between drug discovery and marketing - averaging about 10 years - and at the same time to control the soaring costs of R&D. A striking example of the hard decisions being made was this autumn's announcement by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US group, of 150 redundancies among its UK R&D staff. Equally shocking to people inside and outside the company was its withdrawal from long-term research into gastro-intestinal drugs - the field that led to its best-selling product, the ulcer medicine Tagamet. But George Poste, SB's new chairman of pharmaceutical R&D, said that in today's climate 'resources must be focused on drug discovery with the highest potential for return'. It was not worth continuing to search for new gastro-intestinal drugs, because there were better targets in other fields. Poste also stated SB's intention to hold R&D budgets to about 15 per cent of pharmaceutical sales. That is similar to the R&D commitment of most international drug companies based in Europe and the US. Roche of Switzerland stands out for its large R&D spending, equivalent to 26 per cent of prescription drug sales. As the table shows, Roche more or less matches the two giants of the industry, Glaxo of the UK and Merck of the US, in its total spending on R&D - about Dollars 1bn in 1991. But research expenses are exceptionally high in Switzerland, so Roche does not employ such a large R&D workforce. At the other extreme, companies based in the UK, where scientific salaries are notoriously low, can afford to employ more people for each Dollars 1m spent on R&D. To force the pace of development, companies are setting an increasingly tight timetable for each stage of R&D, accompanied by tough criteria which every project must satisfy if it is to move on to the next stage. For example, ICI Pharmaceuticals in the UK now consistently achieves its target of administering candidate drugs to human volunteers within 14 months of their first synthesis, says Tom McKillop, technical director. This stage used to take an average of 30 months. At the same time ICI has become more determined to abandon drugs that do not live up to their initial promise. The new approach is quite different to the company's traditional attitude which 'assumed that every drug was going to succeed,' McKillop says. Strong management is required to kill a promising research project in the face of lobbying from scientists who have devoted years of work to it - and who still believe it would lead to a blockbuster drug if only the company would let them continue a little longer. As Max Gurtner, head of corporate communications at Roche puts it, 'managing the development pipeline is really tough because you're dealing with people who feel they live or die with their project.' A comprehensive survey of R&D management in the international pharmaceutical industry, published this year by the UK-based Centre for Medicines Research, shows that about half the companies have a target maximum time to take a new drug from discovery to first market. This averages eight to nine years for US and European companies and 12 years for Japanese companies. Detailed analysis of 114 research projects by PA Consulting of the UK suggests that the two largest pharmaceutical companies succeed in getting their drugs to market faster than their competitors. Glaxo and Merck averaged 7.2 years and 7.8 years respectively; the average time to market for eight other international companies was 10.2 years. Their speed is partly the result of clear-sighted management. 'You have to pick the winners, set your priorities and prevent anything else distracting you or cluttering up the system,' said Richard Sykes, Glaxo research director. But size may be an advantage in itself, because the giants have more drugs in development at any one time and therefore more flexibility to concentrate on the most promising candidates. An example is the way Glaxo switched chemical research resources this year into developing a promising Aids drug, 3TC; 'nothing is being allowed to stand in its way,' said Grahaem Brown, who is in charge of the development programme. The giants can also afford to take more risks than smaller companies through 'parallel development' - moving on to the next phase of a project before completing the current one. Pharmaceutical companies in Japan tend to proceed more cautiously, preferring to carry out R&D step by step rather than in parallel, as Stuart Walker, director of the Centre for Medicines Research, points out. As a result Japanese drugs take even longer to reach the market than western ones, but fewer of them are dropped during the development process. Japanese drug companies do not yet spend as much on R&D as their European and US counterparts, with R&D budgets typically amounting to only 10 to 12 per cent of sales. 'They are going to have to increase that spend to come into line with the rest of the world if they want to become major global players,' Walker says. Once drug companies have put the right management in place, researchers can call on an enormous range of new technologies to help them. Computers are now used in every aspect of pharmaceutical R&D, from graphics systems for designing new molecules to information systems for keeping track of the immense volumes of patient data amassed during clinical trials. An example from the start of the drug discovery process is Glaxo's Core-2000, a collection of 2,000 compounds chosen by computer and chemical analysis to give a representative sample of the 10m molecules known to science. The idea was to come up with the most diverse possible selection of molecular structures. Glaxo researchers who want to develop a medicine against a particular target can start by screening the Core-2000 chemicals to discover which has the biological activity they want. This should give a 'lead compound' which can be improved, with the help of molecular graphics computers, to produce one or more candidate drugs. There may be even more opportunity to use information technology later in the R&D process, to accelerate the clinical trials which usually take up more than half of the total time taken to get a drug to market. Merck's Clin*Net project shows how a company can benefit from a computer network linking its headquarters to clinical centres around the world. Clin*Net - installed over the last four years - allows managers to follow the progress of thousands of patients far more effectively than the unwieldy mixture of mail, telephone calls and faxes used previously. For example, the network enabled Merck to analyse early clinical results from Proscar, its new prostate drug, as they came in and to make a quick judgment that it was worth waiting for 12-month data before submitting a licensing application, because these would provide more persuasive evidence of the medicine's efficacy than the six-month data. The progress of science, particularly in genetics and molecular biology, has given the pharmaceutical industry more possible avenues of research than ever before. In one sense this is a golden age of drug development. But pharmaceutical manufacturers already devote a higher proportion of their revenues to R&D than other high-technology industries such as electronics and aerospace. They face a likely squeeze on profits over the next few years as governments tighten price controls. So rising R&D spending - for long a source of pride for drug companies - could soon become an embarrassment.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              WORLD'S TOP PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        R&D           R&D       R&D as %                                   manpower   expenditure       of sales                                       1990          1991           1991                                               (pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Glaxo                                5,700           540             14 Merck                                5,300           510             12 SmithKline Beecham                   4,800           370             15 Hoechst                              4,500           430             16 Ciba-Geigy                           4,300           380             17 Bristol Myers Squibb                 4,000           490             15 Roche                                4,000           530             26 Eli Lilly                            3,600           360             16 Sanofi/Winthrop                      3,600           280             20 Wellcome                             3,600           230             19 Boehringer Ingelheim                 3,500           250             20 Rhone Poulenc Rorer                  3,400           250             13 ICI                                  3,300           220             14 Sandoz                               3,300           380             16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Industry estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
19930422000000000	FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals, Research and Development (8): Selection process is critical - How winners and losers are decided. DEVELOPMENT is a crucial component in the future fortunes of pharmaceuticals groups. Most have access, either internally or externally, to exciting research. But the way companies select new chemical entities and the way they develop them decides the sector's winners and losers. 'The development process is very important. Differentiation comes from the way you select research and how you use it in a creative and flexible way,' explains Dr Rolf Krebs, chairman of Boehringer Ingelheim. Selecting compounds is far from easy yet, according to Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive and director of R&D, this is where the critical decisions are made. 'It is critical to decide which projects to take forward. You have to know the medical need; you have to know that it is technologically feasible; and you have to be innovative. The drug must have the potential to be an important medicine - significant advantages in terms of safety and efficacy or both,' says Dr Sykes. Most R&D directors agree that any compounds must be innovative if they are to be successful. 'If the industry does not generate enough innovative products, it will end up fighting cheap generics with me-too products,' says Dr Krebs. Defining, let alone generating, innovative products is not easy, however. 'The problem is you don't know what's going on elsewhere,' says Dr George Poste, R&D chairman at SmithKline Beecham. 'Take Tagamet, our anti-ulcer product with sales of more than Dollars 1bn a year. Work began on that compound 30 years ago.' New chemical entities are like black boxes, says Dr Poste. It is far from clear if they will work and if they will be safe. You might be behind three other companies, but the opposition's second and third compounds could fall by the wayside, he explains. 'Only generic compounds set out to be me-too drugs,' says Dr Poste. 'Me-too has wrongly become a pejorative term,' says Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. 'Science only moves in small increments. Giant steps are only made once in a decade or even every 20 years. The world's two top-selling drugs - Zantac and Vasotec - were me-too compounds, but with dosing or safety improvements.' Dr Poste agrees, pointing out that 25 of the 32 compounds given a me-too classification by the US Food and Drug Administration in the 1980s actually offered improved safety, tolerability or quality of life, or had better dosing than earlier medicines. Developing innovative drugs is risky. Such molecules take longer to develop than me-toos and there is a heightened danger of them being cut for reasons of safety and efficacy. Dr Max Wilhelm at Ciba says a development portfolio must be balanced, with follow-up products in case some fail. There must also be a good mixture of safe bets and high risk-high reward products. He will only develop products that will reach annual sales of more than SFr500m. Sometimes not being innovative can be justified, says Dr Wilhelm. He explains his recent decision to launch Lotensin, an ace-inhibitor for hypertension, even though the market is saturated and there is even price competition in the US. He argues that by developing the drug it gave the company access to experts and opinion formers. Without Lotensin, Ciba's credibility in the cardiovascular market would have been undermined. 'It kept us in the market place and in the scientific community - and it'll make some money,' says Dr Wilhelm. Other groups are far more Draconian in their approach. Dr Frank-Joachim Morich, director of pharmaceuticals R&D at Bayer, says he is pleased his company fails to figure among the top 50 groups listed in order of the number of compounds in development. He says there is no relationship between the number of compounds in development and innovation. Dr Jurgen Drews, president of international R&D at Roche, has also become increasingly tough. 'We have become very vigorous in refusing to develop agents that do not have an innovative profile. We have cut the number of compounds in development by 15 to 20 per cent over the past 12 to 16 months. We are learning to be strict.' Dr Drews says an increasingly large proportion of molecules proposed by research are now rejected. He reckons 10 years ago only 10 per cent of compounds entering clinical development made it to the market. Now that barriers are higher, the proportion reaching the market is at about 30 per cent. 'There are fewer of them, they are of higher quality, and there is less attrition,' he says. An added complication to the development process is the need to conduct it internationally. In spite of efforts to harmonise regulations, authorities in the US, Japan and Europe, still often require different clinical trials. Given the costs of bringing a drug to market, pharmaceuticals groups must develop their medicines in all three regions, covering more than 80 per cent of the world market. Not all companies have the expertise to do that. While some are beginning to license out products for co-development, others are turning to contract research organisations such as Bessalaar and Pharmaco of the US and Munich-based Harrison Clinical Research to conduct clinical trials. Given the increasing demands of regulatory groups, most groups are looking to cut down on the numbers of studies and the complexity of studies they conduct. 'It's seductive when conducting trials to add in supplementary questions that aren't really necessary and that create enormous quantities of data that can't be analysed,' says Dr Stephen Hill, medical director of Roche Products, Roche's UK subsidiary. R&D directors must also be brutal in cutting projects, says Dr Sykes at Glaxo. 'If a company is ahead of you and your drug is not as good, then you need to act. There's nothing wrong with cutting projects, the decisions have to be made.' Finally, the end product should be a good read, says Dr Drews. 'The new drug application must be attractive and the dossier must have entertainment value. It must be something that is almost fun to deal with. It will then be read faster because the investigator becomes involved in a positive way,' he claims.
19930422000000000	FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals, Research and Development (7): When time can cost a fortune - Speed is essential when bringing drugs to market. REDUCING the time it takes to bring a drug to market has become the pharmaceutical industry's overriding objective. 'The most urgent and immediate issue concerning the industry has been that of time to market,' says Dr Jurgen Drews, president of international R&D at Roche. There are two mains reasons for shorter development time. 'First, you want to help the unmet medical needs of the public you are trying to serve,' says Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. 'The second reason is the limited period that a drug is protected by its patents. Time is money. Anything you can do to pick up time means millions of dollars in sales,' he says. The rule of thumb for drug development is that every day a drug is held back from the market costs the drug company Dollars 1m, explains Mr David Matheson, senior vice-president at Boston Consulting Group. Dr Willi Stammberger, head of development at Hoechst, estimates that one month's delay in launching an important new product results in a cumulative sales loss of DM30m (Dollars 18.6m). Being late hits the company in two ways. It adds costs to the development bill and it reduces revenues at the end of the product's patent life. Speed to market also offers competitive advantage. Dr George Poste, chairman of R&D at SmithKline Beecham, points out that no matter how good a compound is, speed is essential. There is no point being five years behind a competitor's product. 'It's fair to say that speed to market was the primary reason for success during the 1980s,' says Mr Bob Easton, president of The Wilkerson group, the New-York based consultants. 'It's no coincidence that the two fastest companies - Glaxo and Merck - are also the world's biggest pharmaceuticals groups.' But while most groups agree on the need to accelerate drug development, the performance of many groups continues to be disappointing. 'There's still tremendous variability in performance between different companies,' says Mr Matheson, 'The fastest at conducting phase two and phase three studies are three times quicker than the slowest. Some are taking eight years and some as little as two and a half years.' Many research and development directors justify the length of time they take to develop drugs by pointing out it is far more difficult to prove safety and efficacy in some therapeutic areas and indications than others. For example, it becomes clear within a couple of weeks whether or not an antibiotic works, whereas a central nervous system product can take years. 'Take the 5HT3s,' says Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive and head of R&D at Glaxo. 'Zofran for emesis was easy - you either feel sick or you don't. But for anxiety, depression ordementia it's much more subjective whether or not it works.' 'Many R&D directors claim there's a problem of comparing apples and oranges. They are slower because their portfolio has more difficult drugs in it,' says Mr Matheson at Boston Consulting Group. 'But there is a systematic difference between companies.' There are huge differences in performance within therapeutic areas, according to Mr George Farrington, head of pharmaceuticals at The Wilkerson Group. In antibiotics, for example, the best companies can develop medicines in 60 months, compared with 250 months for the worst. One of the key areas that drug groups can improve is the management of their portfolios. 'You have to match resources to the portfolio available, being ruthless about which drugs they take into development,' says Dr Tom McKillop, research and technology director at Zeneca. 'You can't run 12 compounds simultaneously and then decide which one to bet on.' Many companies try to run too many candidates through their pipeline, which slows down the development of all of them. Dr Rosenberg at Bristol-Myers Squibb agrees that resources are always finite. 'We have come to the conclusion that we need to focus our resources. Each compound at a late stage of development needs the best clinical trials that we can offer,' he says. At Schering, Prof Gunter Stock, board director in charge of R&D, says a master plan is agreed at the start of the project. A key compound in accelerated development must not be held up by lack of resources. The correct mix of products within the portfolio is also essential, says Mr Matheson. Groups must have a balance between familiar and new areas. If the area is familiar the company will know the regulators and understand the required end-points for the clinical studies. For new therapeutic areas, the development scientists are leaping the fences for the first time. There must also be a balance of risk within the portfolio, especially in phase one trials, where the likelihood of a compound dropping out is higher. Planning is critical, says Mr Matheson. Companies must consider: A balance between obtaining the necessary data for registration but not making the dossier too complicated. Integrating a team of pharma-economists into clinical development process so the cost-effectiveness of a drug can be incorporated in the regulatory dossier. Manufacturing. They must ensure adequate supplies of the compound are ready for clinical trials. Many groups take the risk of manufacturing large quantities before the end of pre-clinical development. Starting the pivotal study - usually the longest and largest - as soon as possible while ensuring the design is right. Managing the dozens of investigators around the world necessary for the trials. Some should be avoided because they cannot meet deadlines. Others need administrative and computer support. There is a problem of convincing scientists of the need for urgency: Dr Stammberger explains: 'It is not clear to the average scientist on the bench how much money you're losing by delaying a project.' Coping effectively with the paper mountain that builds up from the clinical trials. However, Dr Drews at Roche warns that rushing a product to market is not a panacea. 'Bringing products to market in any quality as quickly as possible only makes sense if you have something worthwhile. There is no point developing something at the speed of light if it is trivial.'
19930422000000000	FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals, Research and Development (5): Working together to create new products - Research and development and marketing departments need to focus resources. AS research and development costs increase, the need to focus resources becomes ever greater. 'R&D departments must join the marketing department in matching scientific expertise with market opportunities,' said Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research, development and medical, UK. Market pressure on the world's pharmaceutical companies to find effective new drugs is increasing. According to the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, the US industry is spending some Dollars 12.6bn worldwide on R&D. To achieve a 15 per cent return on investment, which is the minimum a company might expect given the risks, a 10 per cent per annum compound growth in sales (currently Dollars 231bn) is demanded when there is downward price pressure. Companies most likely to be long-term winners in an increasingly aggressive and competitive R&D environment are those with effective R&D management which can make full use of the new technologies to discover new compounds and utilise the skills of the marketing department from early stages of the conception of an idea. One such company is Wellcome, which believes the success of a pharmaceutical company depends fundamentally on the quality of its R&D and marketing activities and the interaction and synergy between them. The three phases involved in the development of a product, according to Dr Jones, require good commercial input and this becomes more quantified and more important as each phase progresses. A good example of where marketing and R&D can work together is on 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, said Dr Jones. The lipoxygenase pathway is generally responsible for inflammatory disorders and is known to be involved in inflammation, whether it is inflammatory bowel, asthma, allergic rhinitis, psoriasis and arthritis. Dr Jones questions where the focus is on such products 'These are all inflammatory conditions so if a drug works here at an early stage I want the marketing department to focus my attention on which of these areas is likely to be the one to go for, because, otherwise it is shotgun therapy. 'That is where I need someone to work with and agree together the focus beyond the the discovery in the first phase,' he said. 'If it's asthma, because it's a big pathway, my first task is to go to volunteers to see if it works. It's then up to me to get to Phase II. That's when I need the marketing department to give me a design and business case, because I am going to start spending the Pounds 50m/Pounds 100m. 'The goals have changed considerably in the past five to 10 years,' said Dr Jones. 'If a drug is not going to make Wellcome more than Pounds 50m by year three, we are not going to do it.' Dr Rolf Krebs, chairman of Boehringer Ingelheim and former head of Bayer R&D, said: 'Boehringer Ingelheim has no problem in choosing compounds. We are currently in the process of setting up and testing a properly functioning development process. 'You don't need to go for the big markets any more. You can go for niche indications. People formerly feared to go into small markets. But it's zero therapy, you don't know the size of the market. It depends on the economics of the countries and the severity of the disease. It makes you look at marketing and development in a different way.' Dr Krebs points out that the total cost of Dollars 200m includes the failures divided by the successful. 'You have to realise that if competing in a highly competitive market you need a high therapeutic standard and need far more marketing. It takes three to nine years to establish a drug. If you have a lower therapeutic standard, but a completely new product, you need less marketing. That may well allow you to be more profitable in niche markets. 'The changes in technologies opens up niche markets for new drugs and this may be acceptable in the future. If you have indications with high therapeutic benefit you can get higher prices, and lower promotional costs. That could make niches very attractive.' Boehringer Ingelheim in the future will look at the medical properties of the compound and then decide what areas they are interested in - it may have a wide range of compounds. 'I've told the marketing people this could happen. They have to re-organise themselves because marketing is no longer a stable function,' said Dr Krebs. 'We may have to jump from indication to indication'. The view taken at Ciba-Geigy is that they will work only in areas where there is an unmet medical need, where there is room for improvement and where there is internal know-how. Dr Max Wilhelm and Pierre Douaze, head of pharmaceuticals at Ciba, said: 'We don't necessarily have to have marketing expertise. If we don't and the market is really there we can build up expertise. We have a target of SFr300m by five years for any drug - if not we question the development.' They said the figure in the US is about Dollars 250m otherwise they will license out products, especially if it is a product aimed at general practitioners that would stretch marketing resources. 'At Astra the therapeutic areas were not chosen,' said Dr Claes Wilhelmsson, executive vice-president of R&D. 'They just developed - the medicine chose for us. Science leads us. If we have our own competence, we will develop. We are not going to start up areas which are not in our own field.' Astra is prepared to adopt areas. Three years ago the company was not in cancer, but isinto it now. Immuno-suppressors have taken it from the respiratory field to cancer. 'We look for medicines where there are therapeutic needs and try to develop completely new ideas rather than me-too compounds. For example, we haven't developed an ace-inhibitor - we licensed one in from Hoechst,' he said. Alan Archer is editor of Financial Times Pharmaceutical Business News
19930923000000000	FT  23 SEP 93 / People: SERC chief to head Glaxo's research. Glaxo, the world's biggest spender of pharmaceuticals research and development, is reorganising its R&D. The company, which spent Pounds 739 on R&D last financial year and intends to spend Pounds 850m this year, has split the position of R&D director. Sir Mark Richmond, 62, chairman of the UK's Science and Engineering Research Council, is to become director of the research division for a period of two years. The SERC is the largest of Britain's government-funded research councils; it distributes more than Pounds 500m a year in grants to university scientists and engineers. Goran Ando, currently research and development director, becomes director of group development and product strategy. Both Ando and Sir Mark will report to Richard Sykes, chief executive, and board director responsible for R&D. Sykes says the rapidly expanding knowledge base, especially in the understanding of the genetic basis of disease and the microbiology of cells, means that pharmaceutical companies would increasingly have to have access to information from both universities and biotechnology groups. 'To be successful you have to harness these new technologies. Having access research is really critical to the future of the company and you need very good people to do it. 'Sir Mark has exceptional scientific skills from his experience of molecular genetics at Edinburgh University and microbial biology at Bristol University. He also has organisational skills from running the SERC and being vice-chancellor of Manchester University, the largest outside London.' Sir Mark will be responsible for research as Glaxo's research organisation moves into its new headquarters in Stevenage. Sykes says Ando's position was also highly critical. He would be responsible for developing safe, effective medicines that represented significant advances in therapy. For products to be successful, they had to offer value. As head of product strategy, he would ensure that the important links between product development and marketing were tightened.
19931029000000000	FT  29 OCT 93 / SmithKline to move 1,000 research staff. SMITHKLINE Beecham, the second-biggest drug company in Britain, is to spend more than Pounds 200m consolidating its research and development centres. The company said yesterday that no jobs would be lost but 1,000 people would be asked to relocate. SmithKline is buying the 40-acre site of BP's maritime centre in Harlow, Essex, which is next to one of its existing research centres. This will enable it to stop research at four of its seven centres, at Brockham Park, Great Burgh and Reigate in Surrey, and at Worthing in Sussex. The research headquarters will move from Great Burgh to Harlow. The company said: 'There will be significant cost savings through reduction in operating costs by maintaining fewer sites.' It said that staff now travelled 1.5m miles a year between sites and that more people on a single site would 'improve interactions and efficiency'. The acquisition also 'provides enough land to eventually consolidate all UK pharmaceutical R&D in one location, if desired'. The Pounds 200m capital cost of the scheme, and the costs of relocation, have already been accounted for by the company in provisions for the restructuring of its research side. SmithKline's plan comes when the drug sector is under increasing pressure to cut prices from governments anxious to reduce health spending. All staff will be offered relocation assistance. The company conceded that some might be offered redundancy, but that 'the object is not to reduce numbers'. The Reigate centre will close next year when the lease runs out. Most non-research staff will have moved by the third quarter of next year. Remaining employees will be transferred by 1997. R&D will by then be concentrated at just three sites: Harlow, Tonbridge in Kent, and Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire.
19940208000000000	FT  08 FEB 94 / Technology: Delays cut at the stroke of a pen - How computing with a stylus could shorten trial periods for pharmaceutical companies. Time is money for the international pharmaceutical companies. Delays in getting a blockbuster compound to market give rivals time to launch price-cutting imitations. Each day's hold-up can cost a drug company Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in lost revenues. As a result, the race is on to bring in the latest computer technology to cut approval times. Clinical trials in particular have been targeted by the big pharmaceutical companies. While many big drug companies are investing in personal computers or facsimile machines, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in the US has gone one step further. It is conducting trials with pen computers - electronic tablets reminiscent of a Victorian school slate, with a stylus or 'pen' used for writing on the screen. The software is usually displayed as forms, with boxes that can be ticked or filled in. Eventually, pen-based machines could obviate the mountains of paperwork associated with drug trials. These case record forms, completed in triplicate, can be up to 2cm thick for just one patient. A typical trial would involve three phases, with an average of 200 patients per trial. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, part of Rhone-Poulenc of France, is using pen computers in a trial of antibiotics, which began last December. Of the 30 to 40 sites involved, eight will be using the pen computers to duplicate the paper system. The aim, says Greg Fromell, associate director of clinical research in the US, is to assess how much quicker the electronic system could be. Fromell sees two big areas of time saving. First, data entry - transferring the paper-based test results on to the computer - is always a 'bottleneck.' Data often have to be typed two or three times, introducing errors and delays. With the pen computer, information is entered on the screen and can be transferred directly to the main database. Second, researchers lose months correcting basic errors in paper data. The software selected by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, from the German company Padcom, helps eliminate these. If a number is required in response to a specific question, the software will not allow the doctor to enter a letter or a tick. The software can check the birth date of the patient to ensure that he or she is of the appropriate age to take part in the study, or query information which appears to be outside the likely boundaries - unlike a paper questionnaire. Although Fromell believes that the breakthrough has been in the creation of computers that take handwritten information, from companies such as Grid, NCR, Tandy and IBM of the US and NEC and Toshiba in Japan, he argues that it is not the hardware that will provide the competitive edge in drug trials, but the software. At Casella, the Hoechst subsidiary in Frankfurt, clinical project manager Dieter R. Dannhorn believes it is critical to have software which can guide doctors, many of whom will be inexperienced in the use of computers, through the 'form': 'I need doctors who are happy with the system, otherwise I am not going to get any patients for the trials.' Casella has already conducted a short clinical trial with pen computers on 16 patients and is now planning clinical trials of an anti-fungal product involving 240 patients in 10 centres with each patient questioned three times. Each doctor involved will receive a diskette to be completed on each patient visit. For the Rhone-Poulenc Rorer trial, diskettes will also be used to record patient information. They will be posted to the central office where the data will be entered on the database. In future the data could be sent automatically over a phone line. While drugs companies believe it is too early to predict potential savings, Padcom's director of marketing, Peter Munzel, calculates that for a typical Phase II trial, where the drug is tested for efficacy for the first time, the savings could be more than 40 per cent. If 10 centres and 200 patients were involved over a 12-month period, with each patient visiting the doctor six times, Munzel calculates a saving of more than Dollars 205,000 out of a total study cost of Dollars 511,440, in reducing the number of queries and the need for retyping. He argues that if pen computers were used throughout the drugs approval procedure, they could cut a month off each study. With an average of 30 studies per drug, that could cut months - or even years - off the eight to 12 years it usually takes to get a drug approved, giving companies an extra two or three years of sales of a compound before competitors flooded the market. Not everyone is so optimistic. 'The challenge is to make major improvements in a whole host of areas,' says Mark Delfino, a manager specialising in information technology with the Boston Consulting Group, in Chicago. 'A pen-based system per se is only a more friendly interface and an easier way of getting data. Once the data comes in, you still need a set of processes to handle it quickly.' Although pen computers save time in data entry, Dannhorn calculates that unfamiliarity with writing case study books for pen PCs means that it takes him up to five times as long to write one for a pen computer as it does for a paper-based trial. Drugs companies could be drawn into writing much of their own software, with the need to set up expensive centres of technical expertise, adds Delfino. In addition, the cost of the hardware is 'not inconsequential'. He reckons it costs between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 20,000 per site to equip trial sites with machines. Today's pen computers are often relatively heavy and have a short battery life. So far there is no de facto operating system - some companies favour that developed by the Silicon Valley start-up Go; others prefer Microsoft's Windows for Pen Computing. While some pharmaceutical companies have been quick to adopt pen computing, others have strong reservations. One concern is that handwriting recognition technology is still relatively primitive. 'One of the biggest problems is legibility: doctors have notoriously bad handwriting,' says Stephen Hill, UK medical director for Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company. He fears that data could be inaccurately recorded - particularly in international trials conducted in English where English is not the first language of the doctors involved. 'One of the biggest problems is to make sure that the information we collect matches the information on the patient's records,' continues Hill. If the data are entered directly by PC from the doctor's surgery to the company's main database - without intermediary checking - mistakes could slip through. Regulatory issues are also hampering the widespread take-up of such systems. At Pfizer's UK operation in Sandwich, Kent, for example, researchers are still waiting for a pronouncement from the US Food and Drug Administration about the use of electronic signatures. With paper trials, the investigating doctor has to sign all the trial results to validate them, but there are no guidelines about electronic signatures. In Germany, the system is even more restrictive. Although the information from the Casella trial will be recorded on screen, German law requires that the results of the trials be printed out and signed by the doctor if the trial is to be valid. At Glaxo in the UK, researchers are experimenting with pen-based computers but believe it will be another two to three years before they can rely on them utterly. By then, says a spokesman for Glaxo, voice recognition technology - where doctors simply talk to their machines - could have made similar advances and might become the dominant technology.
19940128000000000	FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology: Sandoz splits the R&D difference. Like many big pharmaceutical groups, Sandoz of Switzerland has lived the nightmare of discovering a drug in a new category and then seeing another company bring a competitor compound to market first. That is one reason why it has split its development department away from its research activity. Britain's Glaxo announced a similar move last year. 'Once you decide to develop a product, you have to go full out. There is no room for half measures,' says Urs Barlocher, chief executive of Sandoz. The other reason for the change comes from the research side, where the rapid advance of biochemistry is changing the nature of research management. In the past, pharmaceutical research was chemical-based, and proceeded at a relatively gentle pace. Now, with the rise of biochemistry, it has become more fast moving. Pharmaceutical companies have recognised that the speed of advances in biotechnology makes it impossible to keep their in-house laboratories up to speed on all fronts. Consequently, they have tended to set up co-operation arrangements with independent biotechnology laboratories and start-up companies. Sandoz now has more than 30 such arrangements, consuming a tenth of its SFr1.2bn (Pounds 540m) R&D budget, and Barlocher is convinced the number will rise. 'We do not yet have a good feel for the right balance, but the trend is increasing,' he says. He points out that it has always been difficult to find researchers with management skills, and now the requirements are much greater. 'You need someone who knows what is happening in basic research, where we can find leads for new compounds. He has to be able to decide quickly which co-operation deals we should enter and which ones we should keep. It is a matter of judgment, and in the past we have been too slow.' Assuming such a person can be found, he argues that it is now too much to ask him to look after development as well. In any event, he believes that the management of development, which involves testing a discovery to the point where it can be put on the market, demands different skills from research management. 'In development, it is a question of setting priorities. For the most part it is systematic, not creative. It should be run in a way very similar to a production centre. You can measure results and set clear targets.' Sandoz has had a notoriously slow development department in the past. A few years ago, it brought in the management consultants McKinsey to try to speed the process, and last year it set up a project team approach. 'We still feel we are not among the very best,' Barlocher admits, 'but we are now confident that we can catch up.' He claims that the split will not lead to greater bureaucracy. 'We have tried to segment responsibility by flow of product. We want to give full responsibility to the heads of different sections, and reduce the matrix to a minimum.' Development is by far the most expensive part of the R&D process, especially the clinical studies. Thus, the group believes it must concentrate its research efforts on finding what it calls number one compounds, those that are clearly ahead of the competition. 'It is no longer worth following the other guy. Even if you have a fast development department, it will become more and more difficult to catch up,' Barlocher says. 'And you cannot count on the other guy to make a mistake.'
19940323000000000	FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (10): Thorough preparation can cut costs - If the manufacturer of a product can save a year in its development, that could be equivalent to the final year's sales. For a leading compound, that could be Dollars 400m / Clinical Trials. Few industries operate under such stringent regulatory controls as the pharmaceutical industry. The complexity and volume of the regulations indicate a high cost area, one of which is clinical trials which are expensive and time consuming. The three phases of clinical research are the longest and most costly stages in the development of a new drug. They take an average of four to six years, although depending on the type of drug, they may in an extreme case require 10 years. A single advance in efficiency can be both commercially and scientifically beneficial. Considerable data is assembled from the trials which is subjected to detailed statistical evaluation and medical interpretation. Effective information technology (IT) management can be a competitive aid in cutting high costs and helping to streamline the product development and approval process. Companies cannot take short cuts with clinical trials, but with well-planned IT, the risk of errors in documentation and testing can be greatly reduced. Today, an increasing number of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies are looking to contract research organisations (CROs) to run part or in some cases the whole package of clinical trials. Dr John Mills international vice-president of Besselaar, one of the largest CROs worldwide, said there is a 'dramatic increase' in the amount of contracting-out of clinical trials. 'In the past couple of years we have had twice the number of proposals,' says Dr Mills. Some companies request part service while others are requesting the full works, he adds. A measure of how much clinical trials cost is highlighted by Prof. Richard Peto of the clinical trial service unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, who is carrying out a significant trial on 20,000 people for the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering drug. The trial costing some Pounds 20m is being equally sponsored by Roche, Merck and the MRC. But such large sums have to be viewed in proportion - 'what is Pounds 20m when the sales of the drug are Dollars 1bn per year?' asks Prof. Peto. According to a spokesman at the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, some clinical trials in the US are now costing Dollars 35,000 per patient over a six-month period. There have been alternatives to clinical trials. In 1989, the US Congress created the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to comb through vast databases of records accumulated by hospitals, insurers, and government health programmes since the late 1980s. These studies are known collectively as 'outcomes research.' After spending nearly Dollars 200m on this type of research, AHCPR 'cannot point to a single case in which its database studies have changed clinical practice,' comments Prof Peto. Many companies in the industry are hoping the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) process will save a lot of time and money on clinical trials. There is a desire by the Japanese regulatory agency to harmonise its requirements with those of Europe and America. Dr Trevor Jones research and development director at Wellcome says: 'Until now, we have had to repeat all of the stability data - storage, shelf life, and so on. From now on, we will only do it one way. Some of it we will do in Japan, though. The difficulty is the clinical side and it is still the case that we have to repeat a lot of clinical work in Japan. We now have 65, mostly clinical-related scientists in Japan to carry out the necessary Phase III trials,' he adds. Dr Jones says Wellcome has reorganised R&D to meet global changes. A new group set up in Wellcome called Euroclin, as a prelude to Worldclin. It has 200 staff spread geographically across Europe. There is a large group in France with other groups in Italy, and Germany with basic acquisition of data - 'this has been done without incentives, such as tax relief but there are three very important advantages: to be in touch with local clinicians; regulators; and local companies,' says Dr Jones. Dr Pierre Simon, research and development director of Sanofi, observes that 'you have to set high standards to get compounds into full development. We look at strength, oral activity, duration of action, the toxicology and genotoxicity. 'We also make sure that the molecule is metabolised in man. The drug has to clear the bar, even if its set high,' says Dr Simon. 'When you have to organise a trial like we have for the anti-thrombotic, Clopidogrel this is a real challenge,' he adds. 'We need a two-year study, with 500 centres and 15,000 patients. This is difficult for a young company. So far, we have enrolled 9,000 patients - far faster than we thought and we've saved about six months: that's a huge boost to revenues for a large compound.' jAnother company that keeps a tight rein on its clinical trials preparation is Fujisawa where Dr Hitoshi Oyasu, managing director research and development division, comments: 'We don't like cutting out compounds from our product pipeline, but clinical trials are costly. 'However, we now have 18 NCEs in the cycle - and that is too many. 'We look at the pre-clinical data and if there is no clinical advantages, it gets 'killed.' We 'cut' a promising oral anti-histamine only last year,' he adds. The company believes that the ICH will make a difference to future clinical trials - one day - but progress seems to be difficult at the moment. Dr Oyasu says: 'We are trying to reduce the numbers of clinicians and centres we use for our trials. We want to focus on those investigators who are more reliable and deliver the data on time. 'In the past, some Japanese groups have used the clinical trials as part of their marketing strategy - in some cases there was only one patient per hospital. We want at least eight per hospital.' Dr William Scott, senior vice-president exploratory and drug discovery, Bristol-Myers Squibb, says: 'If you can save one year in development, that's equivalent to the final year's sales. 'For a big compound, that could be Dollars 400m,' comments to Dr Scott. So even if its costs more up front, saving time can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The problem is that the hurdles are getting higher all the time, he adds. The regulatory process is becoming increasingly complex and demanding - 'just take the fact that you now have to do trials using active control compounds so you can compare the new molecule against the old ones. And the fact that regulatory authorities are asking for clinical end-points, rather than just surrogate markers. 'Admittedly, one counter trend is in the area of life-threatening diseases when there's no available therapy. There you can get accelerated approval using surrogate markers. But the approval is only conditional. You can give the drug to all that require it.' Dr Scott adds: 'BMS did this with DDI - which we gave to 27,000 patients - and with D4T which we gave to 9,600 patients, Taxol was also given accelerated approval.'

19940323000000000	FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (9): A more selective approach - Case study / Schering-Plough Research Institute. For US pharmaceutical companies, the impending healthcare reforms promise an era of increased cost-containment and pricing controls. Under the weight of such restrictive measures, how will the innovative drugs industry adapt to survive? According to Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president clinical research at Schering-Plough Research Institute, the market for new drugs will never subside - 'we believe that there will always be a market and a very profitable market for drug companies that can develop novel products that satisfy an unmet need in an important therapeutic area,' he says. In 1993, Schering-Plough spent USDollars 578m on research and development, an investment which it expects to increase to over Dollars 600m this year. Despite its continued commitment to R&D funding, Schering-Plough admits that the more cost-driven market has triggered a change of approach. 'There is a new world now that is forcing us even more to adapt our research and development process,' says Dr Spiegel. At Schering-Plough, most of this adaptation has been evolutionary. About three years ago the company set up a Pharmaceutical Economic Unit designed to assess the economic cost and quality of life benefit of potential new drugs at the earliest possible stage. Evaluation of exactly what Schering-Plough expects to bring to the market when a product is fully developed is now 'a prominent part' of its core R&D process, says Dr Spiegel. Combined with this more selective approach to R&D, is the knowledge that on the way to discovering breakthrough products, drug companies are inevitably exposed to greater risks. This means manufacturers have to be increasingly daring when deciding which compounds to back. Dr Spiegel says: 'If you're only going after Alzheimer's drugs, the winner of that in the pharmaceutical industry will have a nice pot of gold at the end of the process, but there will be a lot more losers along the way.' Willingness to conduct research in more high-risk areas then, is no guarantee of commercial success. As Raul Cesan, president Schering Laboratories suggests: 'We all want to develop something that is unique, yet we may end up with something that is a marginal improvement.' Development of compounds that may offer only a slightly better safety profile over products already on the market is a luxury which research-based drug companies can no longer afford. In certain cases, 'that marginal improvement gives to the system exactly what politicians and government officials want. They lower the price because once you have two or three or four of those (products), prices collapse immediately,' argues Raul Cesan. Research at Schering-Plough covers six main therapeutic areas. These are: anti-infec tives; oncology; allergy; dermatology; cardiovascular and the central nervous system. According to Dr Spiegel, the secret of the company's R&D success lies in its balance of discovery areas. It supports both research into 'quite comfortable' scientific fields and high risk areas 'of great potential yield.' He explains: 'There are times when you're in brand new areas where the regulatory environment and clinical development environment is also unknown. But if you're in those areas that have high potential success, it's worth taking that risk, too.' However, incentives to take such risks could soon disappear if the pricing controls proposed under healthcare reform are approved - 'the proposal to severely review the ultimate pricing of a drug, even if it's a breakthrough product, gives a disincentive to how much risk money you would put up for those types of activities,' warns Dr Spiegel. In any case he believes that current market forces are taking care of price controls within the drug industry. In its 1993 annual report published last week, Schering-Plough announced that between 1991 and 1993, it held average US net prescription drug price increases to below the rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI), and in 1994 expects price rises again to be at or below the increase in CPI. 'Prices have been moderating dramatically,' comments Raul Cesan. While individual companies may be suffering a loss of appetite for R&D risk-taking, the US drug industry as a whole is maintaining its commitment to R&D through teamwork. Joint ventures and alliances between university research departments, smaller biotechnology companies or established pharmaceutical companies show that by pooling their resources, drug companies can continue the search for innovative products. In future, Dr Spiegel predicts, 'there will be more incentive to form alliances in the research area to spread your bets, and that's certainly a concept that we embrace.' In its annual report, Schering-Plough says that about 25 per cent of its research dollars were targeted for biotechnology. Another form of alliance has seen US drug companies tap into the market of managed care. Last year, Merck & Co acquired health maintenance organisation Medco Containment Services for Dollars 6bn, in a move widely regarded as an attempt to protect market share. Effectively, the acquisition changed Merck's mission from being a research-based pharmaceutical company to a major player in the healthcare market. Such redefinition of company business strategy is not anticipated by Schering-Plough. To ensure long-term survival beyond healthcare reform, the company believes continued investment in its R&D pipeline is essential. Raul Cesan concludes: 'You have to find the very successful drugs eventually  -otherwise you cannot survive.'
19940323000000000	FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (5): Research moves to sharper focus - Therapeutic categories. As growth of the world's pharmaceuticals market continues to decelerate, so research and development managers are being forced to be more focused in the way they direct their companies R&D efforts. 'I think R&D spending will slow down,' says Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive of Merck. 'Over the last 15 years, R&D has grown at about 14 per cent a year. I'd love that to continue, but it's no longer an option.' Most groups are responding to the new environment by reducing the number of therapeutic categories they explore. Admittedly, a few, giant groups, can continue to cover most areas. Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck Research Laboratories, says: 'You can do research in most things in most therapeutic areas. It doesn't cost that much.' Other companies, without the benefit of an R&D budget of more than Dollars 1bn a year, and 1,800 people working in discovery, are being forced to concentrate their efforts. 'You have to be at the leading edge of the areas you're researching and you have to be focused,' says Mr Lodewijk de Vink, president and chief operating officer of Warner-Lambert. 'It'll be like the biotechnology industry. You'll soon be talking about burn-out rate for those pharmaceuticals companies still looking at all areas.' Choosing which therapeutic areas to investigate is far from easy - 'the hardest decision you have to make is which areas to explore,' says Dr William Scott, senior vice-president exploratory drug discovery research at Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'It's like a kid going into a candy store with a credit card. You can kill yourself. You have to be very focused.' Many R&D directors continue to duck the difficult decisions. Although they claim they are more focused than before, the areas they continue to explore cover most human diseases. An R&D director whose researchers are looking at inflammatory diseases can cover diseases as diverse as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel syndrome. When choosing which areas to cover, there are a large number of criteria adopted by companies. The most important are probably medical need and biological science, according to Dr Scolnick - 'biologically you have to understand the basic physiology - what the disease mechanisms are. We find projects with the right combination of scientific understanding and medical need and then we set to work.' Dr Takao Tanakaya, executive director drug discovery division at Fujisawa, agrees: 'You have to understand the basic pathology of the disease. Although Alzheimer's looks interesting because there's a huge potential market, we've steered clear of dementia because we don't understand what's going on. That means it's difficult to develop anything really innovative.' Some companies also try to match unmet needs with the their expertise. At Schering-Plough, management will only work in areas that match the company's strengths, where the group has sufficient critical mass to make a difference, according to Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president clinical research. The demand for new treatments for diseases in the elderly, such as osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's has attracted many companies. Dr Teruhisa Noguchi, executive vice-president for R&D at Yamanouchi, explains: 'We've decided to concentrate on cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal and central nervous system diseases, as well as endocrinology, diabetes and bone disorders. They're all linked to the ageing population which is a real problem in Japan.' But there are dangers in focusing only on untreated and unexplored areas. Some groups see the need to balance the risks between different therapeutic categories. Dr Spiegel at Schering-Plough explains: 'There are some discovery areas where we are quite comfortable that if we invest the money and have the patience, products will come out. 'But there are others that are high risk areas that are scientifically exciting and could be of great potential yield, if you hit it right.' 'The problem is that the new areas are really difficult,' says Dr Spiegel. 'In brand new fields, the regulatory and clinical environments are unknown. 'Take Alzheimer's: until Parke Davis had Cognex approved, nobody knew what sort of efficacy the FDA wanted. There had never been a drug approved in that area before. You have to have a balance of risk.' A number of companies have cut the number of therapeutic areas in a meaningful way. SmithKline Beecham's exit from gastro-intestinal disease more than 12 months ago - it was an area that virtually created its predecessor SmithKline French - was probably the most dramatic. However, Wellcome has also moved out of tropical diseases, and Dr Trevor Jones, director of research, development and medical, says the group will stop developing new anaesthetics once it has completed its present generation of products. Dr Pierre Simon, R&D director at Elf Sanofi, explains his company's decision to concentrate on only three areas. 'Seven years ago, Sanofi was present in all areas of research. I told the chairman it was stupid  - you can't do all that effectively because development is becoming more and more sophisticated and expensive. Instead, we decided to concentrate on just three areas.' Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, says: 'We'll have to cut some areas over the next few years. We won't scale back on cardiovascular or oncology, and we have a very major position in dermatology. 'We'll also stake our future on immunological areas, but in central nervous system diseases and diagnostics we cannot lead. Now that there's a bright light shining down on everything we do, we have to concentrate on those areas where we are leaders and have greatest strengths.' Once the therapeutic areas have been chosen, the R&D directors next difficulty is to decide which of the many compounds competing for limited developed resources should be selected. 'For the last while, we have only pursued those new therapies that will produce a clear medical benefit. We will only develop those with a distinct advantage,' says Dr Paul Herrling, head of research at Sandoz. 'There's much more scrutiny than there used to be about the quality of the drugs in development,' agrees Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice president clinical research at Schering-Plough. 'You have to look at what the market will bear for a product which is only a minor improvement.' 'The medicines have to add value, otherwise we're not prepared to spend time and money on them,' says Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo. Dr Scolnick agrees: 'You have to have uniqueness in discovery, otherwise you end up selling generic drugs.' Dr Simon adds that he recently cut some beta-blockers and H2-antagonists from his pipeline even though they were safe and effective - 'they made no sense because they were little better than existing therapies.' he says. Similarly, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer last year cut a safe and effective 5HT-3 antagonist similar to Glaxo's highly successful Zofran, because it was no better than existing compounds, according to Mr Robert Cawthorn, chief executive. Some groups abandon even promising and innovative projects, however. Dr Simon at Elf Sanofi explains: 'When you are using biochemical screening you come up with interesting compounds that do not fit exactly in the areas where you want to work. 'We came up with a good asthma drug, but we had no intention of getting into asthma. We want to license it out. The problem is one of timing. If you talk to early, you haven't much to say. If you're too late you lose time. You have to have good clinical trials to show it's good and then sell out quickly.' Most R&D directors agree it is far easier to develop good quality drugs than poor ones. Dr Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&D at Eisai, agrees: 'Our chairman, Mr Yuji Naito, asks us to find compounds that are so good they develop themselves.' At Sanofi, Dr Simon adds: 'You have to set high standards to get compounds into development. We look at strength, oral activity, duration of action, the toxicology and genotoxicity. 'We also make sure the molecule can be metabolised in man. The drug has to clear the bar, even if it's set high.' Production costs are also an important issue, according to Dr Herrling. 'You have to look at how complicated the molecule is and how many steps it takes to synthesise. The cost and complexity of manufacture is becoming much more important,' he says. Dr Stephen Carter, senior vice-president worldwide clinical research and development at Bristol-Myers Squibb agrees: 'If it's going to takes 15 chemical steps to produce a compound, I might need 20 chemists full-time working for a year to generate enough for a clinical trial. If that's the case, I might not put it into development.' The potential market of a drug is also clearly important. Dr Noguchi at Yamanouchi says his company has set a target of minimum annual sales of Y2bn  -about Dollars 200m - for drugs to move into development. One consequence of the new cost-conscious environment is that decisions about the future of molecules are made much earlier than before. 'Just recently we discontinued a couple of compounds which in earlier times we would have continued to see what happened to them. Today, we just don't have the luxury of doing that,' says Dr Spiegel at Schering-Plough. However, although most companies pay lip-service to the over-riding drive towards innovation, most R&D directors admit they need to balance their portfolios for risk. In Japan, these low-risk, low-reward, compounds are called survival drugs, according to Dr Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&D at Eisai. 'Let's be honest about this,' agrees Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'If you just go for high-risk, high-reward blockbusters, you're just going for home runs. That's not necessarily good for business. 'You have to have singles and doubles to support the franchises. You need to balance across the franchises and across the risk. A Dollars 100m product in an old franchise is more valuable than a Dollars 150m product in a new area.' Few companies admit setting out to create me-too drugs. However, Dr Spiegel admits that when you set out to find something exciting you sometimes only come up with a drug offering marginal improvements. An important area little stressed by R&D directors publicly is that of line extensions. 'We call the process evergreening,' says Dr John Niblack, president Pfizer central research. Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb agrees: 'Line extensions help quality of life and generate increased exclusivity for the company. 'Besides, developing line extensions is easier than developing new compounds because the safety is already proven - you just have to show efficacy. We don't have to spend a lot of money on this, but it's worthwhile.'
19890110000000000	ANTI-ANEMIA DRUG FINALLY GETS CLOSE TO CIRCULATION. The magic potion is a clear liquid packed in vials and kept refrigerated in a Thousand Oaks warehouse while it sits waiting to be sold. It's the latest biotechnology drug, called erythropoietin, or EPO, an anti-anemia treatment that, after seven years and $70 million in research and development, will be the first commercial product of a company called Amgen. "It's a product for which there is no alternative," said George Rathmann, Amgen's chairman. Amgen is doing all it can to get off to a fast start. "Running out of material is unacceptable," said Gordon Binder, Amgen's chief executive. So Amgen's new manufacturing plant is up and running and has turned out a three-month supply of EPO while Amgen is hiring salespeople and has lined up refrigerated warehouses around the country to keep the drug fresh. Everything is ready save one thing. Amgen still needs U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the drug. No one expects the FDA to reject Amgen's request to sell EPO, a hormone that triggers production of red blood cells, that in clinical tests successfully treated the chronic anemia suffered by patients with kidney disease. EPO was discovered by scientists in 1906, but the body produces only microscopic amounts of the hormone, and the challenge has been how to get enough of it.  Able to Make Drug But in biotechnology, scientists are medical detectives who by resplicing genes, which carry the blueprints of life, can trigger production of rare hormones and proteins so they can be used as a therapeutic drug. Amgen has submitted 40,000 pages of supporting documents and conducted extensive EPO tests on patients, winning glowing reviews in the New England Journal of Medicine. Amgen's executives had hoped that the FDA would complete its elaborate review and approve EPO for sale by late 1988. Now the company is "very optimistic" that the drug will be approved for sale by March, Binder said. During the wait, Amgen's stock has bounced up and down on each scrap of news about the FDA's approval process. Financial analysts still expect Amgen to be the first company to win approval to sell EPO because it applied to the FDA more than a year ahead of any other company. And with that approval will come riches. What is unnerving, though, is that no one seems certain how plentiful those riches will be. In November, Amgen's stock spurted when an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton predicted worldwide sales for EPO of $3.5 billion, with $1.8 billion in the United States by 1993. Binder said that the figure was preposterous. "We just find it hard to accept a plan on any drug selling more than $1 billion, no matter what it cures," he said.  'Excited About Amgen' Last week, Montgomery Securities analyst Denise Gilbert made her own projection that EPO would sell no more than $450 million in the United States by 1993, and the stock dipped. "I'm excited about Amgen and find EPO a compelling story. But I'm trying to deflate expectations," she said. The trouble is that the stock market has lost much of its confidence in biotechnology and fears that only a few companies out of the hundreds will actually produce drugs that are big winners. Amgen has much at risk. The company has five other drugs undergoing tests in humans, but EPO has secured the little company's reputation and boosted the value of Amgen's stock to $550 million, even though until now it essentially has been without a product to sell. Last year Amgen earned $1.7 million on sales of $53 million, but those figures are a mirage. The sales are primarily advances from the company's research and development partners, while the "profits" are from investments. The stock market is also pessimistic about biotechnology because of the many misadventures of Genentech, the San Francisco biotech company whose reputation took a terrible beating last year. A year ago Genentech's stock was trading at $47 per share and there was no end to the enthusiasm for its latest drug, TPA, an anti-blood-clotting agent that could save heart attack victims. The drug would sell $400 million in its first year, analysts boasted, and Genentech's executives did nothing to discourage those expectations. Genentech ended up selling about $175 million worth of TPA in 1988, still a record for first year sales of a new drug, but the stock collapsed and now languishes at $17. What went wrong? The drug was expensive -- at $2,200 a dose TPA is 10 times the price of older heart attack drugs -- and various studies were inconclusive about TPA's advantages over other drugs. Only last month, Genentech wrote off $25 million worth of TPA inventory because the drug is perishable and sales were far slower than the company's optimistic projections. Binder says he learned from Genentech's troubles. "You don't want to spend money making something you're not going to use. In some industries you have a big sale and mark the price down. That's not possible in pharmaceuticals." Lesson No. 2, Binder said is: "We try to have reasonable expectations about Amgen's results." Gilbert recently trimmed her 1990 profit estimates for Amgen after the company's executives told her what they would need to spend to get EPO into the market. Still, most analysts figure Amgen has a big winner in EPO. The biggest use will be to help treat patients who undergo kidney dialysis to cleanse impurities from their blood. Those patients cannot produce enough red blood cells and many of them need transfusions of up to four quarts of blood a month. But patients injected with EPO didn't need the transfusions and were able go about their lives more normally. To encourage companies to come up with drugs to treat relatively rare diseases, Congress awards so-called "orphan drug status," a seven-year exclusive franchise, to the first manufacturer of such drugs. EPO qualifies as an orphan drug and Amgen has shrewdly kept the rights to sell EPO to kidney dialysis patients. Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter, says that is likely to be a $200-million-a-year market in this country.  Other Possible Uses EPO may also work in treating other kinds of anemia, including chemotherapy and leukemia patients. EPO is also being tested with AZT, an AIDS treatment drug that produces anemia as a side effect. Sales of EPO to patients other than those with kidney disease would be open to other companies with their own versions of EPO, but analysts can't agree on how big that market will be. Johnson & Johnson will sell Amgen's version of EPO for other, disparate uses in this country while paying Amgen a royalty, estimated by analysts at 8% of gross sales. By Gilbert's reckoning, Amgen's profits will grow like a weed, from $15 million for the March, 1990, fiscal year, to $83 million in 1993. By then, she figures Amgen's second drug, G-CSF, which produces white blood cells, will strike gold as well. Even if Amgen wins the EPO race from the laboratory to the marketplace, it must still win a battle of wits in the courtroom to ensure its profits. Amgen is now locked in four patent-infringement lawsuits with its chief rival, Genetics Institute, a biotech company, which with Chugai Pharmaceutical of Tokyo is racing to get its own version of EPO approved for sale in the United States. Most analysts figure that Genetics Institute, with headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., is at least a year behind Amgen. Both Amgen and Genetics Institute have separate, seemingly conflicting patents relating to EPO, and it could take years for the cases to go all the way through to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Until the cases are resolved, both companies should be free to sell the new drug, but whichever company wins in court figures to take home the biggest share of profits. Genetics Institute has been willing to discuss an out-of-court settlement with Amgen, presumably for some sort of cross-licensing deal in which both could sell the drug, but Amgen's executives have refused. "We're so far apart there's nothing to discuss," Binder said.
19890530000000000	PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM BANKS ON REPUTATIONS; ISIS FOUNDER HAD NO TROUBLE LURING BACKERS TO AN UNEXPLORED FRONTIER OF BIOTECHNOLOGY. As ISIS Pharmaceuticals President Stanley Crooke walked through his company's newly leased Carlsbad facility, he took pains to point out that, despite the mostly vacant office and laboratory space, his new biotechnology firm is hard at work developing products at a temporary lab in Sorrento Valley. But the nearly empty building in the Carlsbad Research Center symbolizes Crooke's formidable task of building a company from scratch, of being a pioneer in an unexplored frontier of biotechnology and of having to translate the as-yet-undeveloped technology into marketable products. Crooke, 44, formed ISIS two months ago after an illustrious career heading up product research operations at two major pharmaceutical firms, SmithKline Beckman and Bristol-Myers. Crooke, who holds a medical degree as well as a doctorate in pharmacology, oversaw the introduction of 17 new drugs during his 14 years at the two firms.  Cheaper Than Boston He selected San Diego County for ISIS headquarters so it could be near the growing biotechnology community clustered around UC San Diego and Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. Although housing is expensive in San Diego, Crooke said it's cheaper than in Boston and the San Francisco Bay area, two other headquarters sites he considered. Carlsbad was chosen over other county locations because of favorable lease rates, he said. "Crooke is one of the three or four best drug developers in the world, based on his success at SmithKline and Bristol-Myers," said Christopher Gabrieli, general partner of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Menlo Park-based venture capital firm with investments in eight biotechnology companies, including ISIS. He described drug development as an enormously complex, drawn-out and expensive process. Before resigning last summer, Crooke was vice president in charge of SmithKline's research and development operation, where he had a $300-million budget. At Bristol-Myers, which he left in 1980 to join SmithKline, Crooke helped develop an array of chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients that put Bristol at the forefront of cancer treatment. Trading on his visibility in the pharmaceutical industry, Crooke has moved fast since starting up ISIS in March. He has raised $5.2 million in venture capital and hired 20 employees, many of them research "stars" with strong track records in pharmaceuticals and academia. Crooke was able to raise the money from five venture capital firms, including Bessemer, plus obtain commitments for up to $10 million next year, even though ISIS may be years away from successful technology, much less U. S. Food and Drug Administration approval of products. The company's payroll will grow from 20 to 30 employees by year's end and to as many as 90 in 1990, he said. "It's been a long, long time since I've seen an initial venture funding for $5.2 million," said Ray Dittamore, managing partner of Arthur Young & Co., a firm whose clients include more than a quarter of San Diego's 70 biotechnology companies, including ISIS. "That by itself tells a lot about what the investors and the biotech community think of (Crooke) and the team he's put together." Apart from Crooke, the venture capitalists' interest revolves around the technology ISIS is trying to develop called anti-sense oligonucleotides. The "oligos" are bits of DNA that bind to "messenger molecules" sent out by DNA that cause the production of disease-bearing proteins. By binding to disease messengers, which are called messenger-RNA, the oligos theoretically prevent the disease "message" from being passed on and thus from ever being produced, Crooke said. "Anti-sense oligonucleotides is a method that lots of (drug) companies think is going to work, and ISIS is one of those companies," said Ignacio Tinoco, a professor of chemistry at University of California, Berkeley, who is on ISIS' scientific advisory board. "The idea is that, instead of attacking the diseased proteins, you target the RNA that causes them to be synthesized." Crooke said the potential for anti-sense drugs is enormous because they could be manufactured as therapeutic agents for virtually any disease since virtually all diseases start as aberrant proteins set in motion by messenger-RNA molecules. ISIS plans to develop its anti-sense drugs using so-called "rational drug design," or the computer-aided process of designing drugs "by force of thought," Crooke said.  $2-Billion Market Citing competitive concerns, Crooke refused to disclose which diseases ISIS has targeted for its first set of products. He did say, however, that the company is pursuing "four markets with aggregate sales potential of $2 billion." He declined to say whether AIDS is one of the diseases targeted. ISIS' competition so far includes San Diego-based Genta, a company that was spun off recently by Gen-Probe, a publicly held manufacturer of DNA-probe diagnostic products. (Genta President Thomas Adams was unavailable for comment Friday.) Crooke said he expects major pharmaceutical firms to join the field in coming years as well. Although Crooke had studied anti-sense oligonucleotides for the better part of two decades, he said he became convinced they could be used as therapeutic drugs three years ago. That conviction sprang from advances in molecular biology research that have enabled scientists to clone or synthesize DNA molecules. Crooke was also encouraged by scientists' increasing ability to modify or manipulate those molecules through a process called hybridization, or the binding of one molecule to another. It's that binding process by which ISIS' anti-sense nucleotides will someday "kill" the disease-causing RNA molecules, he said. But Crooke said he was unable to generate much enthusiasm among his SmithKline colleagues for pursuing the technology, perhaps because the approach was so revolutionary. That, combined with SmithKline's financial problems last year and the resulting impact on the 3,000-scientist research program in Upper Merion, Pa., he directed prompted Crooke to resign.  Return to Academia At first, Crooke's plan after leaving the drug company was to return to academia, specifically to Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, where he has been a faculty member on and off for the past 15 years. But Crooke soon realized that he was too enamored of the high-stakes game of producing new drugs and the social benefits that successful drugs represent. A turning point in his medical career came when, as a young doctor in Houston, he watched a 24-year-old man die of testicular cancer, a disease that is now largely curable with drugs developed at Bristol-Myers during Crooke's tenure there. In March, ISIS signed an agreement with Applied Biosystems, a publicly held biotech company in Foster City that is a leading manufacturer of instruments that produce DNA. The deal calls for the two companies to share rights to products developed. ISIS expects Applied Biosystems to help it surmount a formidable problem: how to produce anti-sense drugs in adequate quantities. Producing DNA and its derivatives is exceedingly difficult in anything but trace amounts, he said. "It's almost like going to the moon to consider making clinical kilograms of DNA," said Timothy Geiser, senior scientist at Applied Biosystems. Because of the difficulty, the products that will be developed by ISIS and Applied Biosystems instead will be derived from substitutes called DNA analogs. Geiser said his company expects to sign similar agreements with other anti-sense manufacturers. Anti-sense drugs are "a brand-new field with no clear leader yet,"' Geiser said. "But we are impressed with ISIS because Crooke and several of his people have experience in drug development. I wouldn't say they have technology that gives them an exclusive edge, but in terms of smarts, they are way ahead of the pack."
19890602000000000	GENE-SPLICED ANEMIA DRUG OKD FOR SALE. A genetically engineered drug expected to relieve the chronic anemia suffered by thousands of people with kidney disease was approved for sale Thursday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The drug also has shown promise in treating anemia in AIDS and cancer patients, but it was not yet approved for those uses by the government. The announcement capped an eight-year effort by Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks to bring to market what is expected to be one of biotechnology's first blockbuster drugs. Amgen's costly drug -- known as erythropoietin, or EPO -- is a gene-spliced version of a naturally occurring protein in the kidney that triggers production of red blood cells, which in turn transport oxygen throughout the body. Patients suffering from kidney disease do not produce enough red blood cells and often have very little energy, and many of them must endure frequent blood transfusions. There are about 100,000 kidney dialysis patients in this country, and the 25,000 or so who need frequent transfusions are ideal candidates for EPO, experts say. In clinical tests, most patients given injections of EPO no longer needed blood transfusions and found that much of their old energy returned. EPO is being tested with the AIDS drug AZT in hopes of minimizing anemia, and is being reviewed for treating the types of anemia suffered by patients with cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases. "We feel very strongly that there will be other uses," said FDA Commissioner Frank Young. "There's a tremendous demand from patients for the product," said David Weber, a securities analyst with the brokerage firm of Alex. Brown & Sons. "There were even stories of people who tried very hard to get into the clinical trials" for EPO, Weber said. The FDA approved EPO, which will be sold under the brand name Epogen, only for anemia caused by kidney disease. However, once it is on the market, doctors may prescribe it for anemia due to other causes, although that practice has note been endorsed by the FDA. One drawback of the drug is its cost. It could become one of the most expensive drugs ever reimbursed by the federal government, eventually costing perhaps $200 million to $500 million a year overall for all kidney dialysis patients.  Government's Costs The average patient suffering from kidney disease would need $4,000 to $8,000 worth of the drug every year, but Gordon Binder, Amgen's chief executive, said he expects the federal government to cover most of that expense. Until EPO is approved for other uses, however, it will not be determined how much of the cost would be picked up in those cases. Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he is concerned about the hundreds of millions of dollars that the use of EPO could cost the federal government. Some of that concern may stem from the fact that members of Stark's staff, using data released in a court battle between Amgen and another manufacturer, calculated that it would cost only only $140 to manufacture a year's supply of the drug for an average patient. Amgen officials said the high price being charged for the drug would help the company recoup the cost of developing EPO, estimated at $100 million, and would provide money to develop other new products. Besides Amgen, the winners from the FDA approval are the patients who have been waiting to get the drug. Amgen expected to start selling EPO last winter, but when things were delayed, some frustrated kidney dialysis patients began buying EPO by mail order from Europe. Patients such as Valerie Buhler of Pasadena were taking advantage of an obscure FDA policy that allows for personal importation of most drugs that are legally available overseas, as long as they are purchased in small amounts and for personal use. Since March, Buhler, 65, has been spending $650 a month out of her own pocket to buy EPO from a pharmacy in West Germany. Before she began her twice-a-week treatments, "running a few errands just tired me out," she said. Since then, "The difference has been remarkable." She added, "As happy as I've been with the results, I can't help but feel bad for other people who don't have the drug." The FDA's approval, she said, was "fantastic," and timely as well. "I was just about to order some more from Germany," she said. Kidney disease patients who lack the natural protein would take regular injections of the drug for life to prevent the anemia. "It's almost like insulin if you're diabetic," said Louise J. Keating, director of Northern Ohio Red Cross Blood Services and chairman of the FDA advisory committee that recommended the drug's approval. As the first company to win approval to sell EPO, Amgen is expected to win a big chunk of the market for kidney dialysis patients, which is expected to be at least $250 million a year by the early 1990s. For now, there is no alternative to EPO, a fact that has excited the financial community. The drug, Amgen's first commercial product, "is clearly a home run" for the company, said Denise Gilbert, a biotechnology analyst with Montgomery Securities. "We're very excited. We've worked eight years for this day," Binder said. Binder said the first shipments of the drug, marketed under the trade name Epogen, will arrive next week in doctors' offices. By the end of the year, Binder expects Amgen to be selling EPO at a rate of $100 million a year. Amgen's stock, traded over the counter, closed Thursday at $41 a share, up 87.5 cents, as 1.1 million shares of stock changed hands. Amgen has kept the rights to sell EPO to the kidney dialysis market but it has licensed all other uses of the drug in this country to Johnson & Johnson. How much business Amgen will enjoy is unclear because the company is locked in a major patent infringement lawsuit over EPO with biotech rival Genetics Institute of Cambridge, Mass. Amgen and Genetics Institute hold different patents related to EPO and a patent infringement trial is scheduled to begin Aug. 7 in Boston. In a separate case, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will begin hearings this summer to decide which of the two rival companies' EPO claims have priority. In the past Amgen officials have refused to consider an out-of-court cross-licensing agreement with Genetics Institute, a tactic some analysts say is risky. Binder said Thursday, however, that an out-of-court agreement "is always a possibility."  Possible Settlement Bruce Eisen, chief patent counsel with Genetics Institute, also said that an out-of-court pact is possible before the patent trial begins. "It's quite common that cases are settled on the courthouse steps. When the moment of confrontation comes, somebody flinches." The FDA awarded so-called orphan drug status to Amgen's EPO, which ordinarily would give the company a seven-year exclusive right to sell the drug to kidney dialysis patients. Orphan drug status covers drugs that treat patients suffering from relatively rare diseases, those with fewer than 200,000 cases. But the FDA also said it might also award orphan drug status to another version of EPO that has been developed by Chugai-Upjohn using technology licensed by Genetics Institute. Joseph Sobota, chief operating officer at Chugai-Upjohn, said his company hopes to win FDA approval within six months and expects to be "a vigorous competitor" despite Amgen's head start. Amgen's Binder said, "We've always been more concerned with patent protection than orphan drug status." Spending heavily to prepare for the launch of the drug, Amgen lost $8 million in its fiscal year ended March 31. However, analyst Gilbert expects Amgen to have pre-tax earnings of $70 million from EPO sales by 1993. RELATED STORY: Part IV, Page 1
