corporate financial crime sentencing What sentences are being imposed for financial crimes such as fraud and embezzlement What are the current trends in prosecuting and sentencing for this type of crime Are judges claiming to be sending any messages to other would be criminals in their sentencing practices.
The ground didn t shake too much and even the drought parched canyons did not ignite.
True there was the winter storm early in the year that caused the newly rebuilt Huntington Beach Pier to collapse.
But that was nothing compared to the collapse of careers and the tumbling of stature among many of the county s once towering figures.
A rising star in the Republican Party plummeted when he forged a signature on a check in a last ditch effort to bail out his campaign for Congress.
A millionaire video producer from Newport Beach was charged with making illegal campaign contributions to failed Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart and other candidates.
An Orange County supervisor running for Congress was caught red faced when it was revealed that she did not graduate from college as her biographies stated.
Even the always powerful Orange County Republican Party took it on the chin when it posted uniformed security guards at polling places in Latino areas of Santa Ana to warn non citizens not to vote prompting an FBI investigation into allegations of voter intimidation.
Indeed 1988 was the election year that many people would like to forget.
Badham (R Newport Beach) a six term congressman surprised supporters by announcing that he would not run for reelection which opened the door to a free for all that led to a promising young politician s demise.
David Baker Irvine city councilman and former college basketball star seemed to be the heir apparent to Badham s seat until C.
Christopher Cox gave him a run for his money in the June primary.
And when that money began to run short in the final days before the election a desperate Baker turned to the bank account of a nonprofit health foundation that he directed for an advance on a loan that was a few days late.
He wrote a 48 000 check to himself signing his own name and forging the signature of a judge a foundation director.
He stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written but the damage was done.
Baker who was narrowly defeated by Cox pleaded guilty to a felony forgery count but a Superior Court judge later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor.
The judge ordered Baker to perform community service and gave him a year s probation and a 1 year suspended jail sentence.
Even when the sentence was imposed Baker was delivering hot meals to the elderly and working with children.
Another legislative seat unexpectedly opened with the death of Assemblyman Richard E.

That opened up a king sized contest between Republicans and Democrats for his seat and that race too led to a finish line stumble.
Sent Out the Guards In their fervor to see their candidate Curt Pringle win county Republican Party officials not only got out the vote on Nov.
Uniformed security guards were hired by the party to stand watch at heavily Latino polling places to warn people that it was illegal for non citizens to vote.
The Democrats cried foul and even high ranking Republicans denounced the move.
The FBI and district attorney s office are now investigating whether election laws were violated and several Latino and labor organizations have filed suit to overturn the election results in the 72nd Assembly District where Pringle ended up winning by a mere 867 votes.
Wieder s election foibles left her with a red face.
Running for Congress in the June primary Wieder conceded under pressure from her opponent that she had left uncorrected a 25 year old error on her biography that stated she had received a bachelor s degree in journalism from Wayne State University in Detroit.
In truth she was unable to attend college because of family finances.
Also under fire from slow growth advocates for her votes on development agreements Wieder lost the race.
Karl Stubbed His Toe Republicans did not have a monopoly on election year problems.
the millionaire producer of the Jane Fonda workout tapes was fined 60 000 and placed on 3 years probation for making 185 000 in illegal campaign contributions to self destructing presidential candidate Gary Hart and others.

EX NORWALK OFFICIAL SENTENCED IN FRAUD CASE.
Former Norwalk City Administrator William H.
Kraus was sentenced in federal court in San Diego to five years probation and fined 1 000 for his part in a land fraud scheme that bilked investers out of more than 3 million.
Kraus 50 is also required to pay 20 000 in restitution over the next 4 1 2 years to victims.
The former city administrator pleaded guilty in 1987 to one count of mail fraud which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a 1 000 fine.
But in an interview this week Kraus maintained he was not involved in the scam and that he was held responsible for the actions of a co defendant.
said Kraus who resigned from his Norwalk post in 1983 after questions arose about personal business dealings unrelated to the current case.
Kraus and seven other men were charged in 1985 with 23 counts of mail fraud in the use of two companies one in California and one in Utah to defraud investors.
Some of the victims lost money by purchasing real estate at artificially inflated prices.
The majority lost money by investing in a company that promised a 36 to 48 annual return based on what turned out to be a series of phony transactions.
Pent the prosecutor in the case said Kraus received a relatively light sentence because he played a limited role in the fraud ring and because he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
Pent said Kraus would have testified against his co defendants had they been tried.
The charge to which Kraus pleaded guilty involved a single San Diego County property.
Pent said Kraus allowed a beach condominium to be bought under his name in 1981.
He then transferred the title to a co defendant and paid for appraisals that greatly inflated the property s worth Pent said.
Two investors in the property lost about 50 000 said Pent who added that there was no proof Kraus made any money off the deal.
Kraus left his Norwalk job in 1983 after a decade as the city s administrator.
Kraus said he is now self employed running a Garden Grove firm called William H.
The firm manages three nonprofit associations in Los Angeles and Orange counties Kraus said.
in public administration and taught a class called as recently as last year at California State University Long Beach.
A university spokeswoman said Kraus is not scheduled to teach at the university during the spring semester.
Kraus said he will teach at three Southern California colleges this spring but he declined to identify them.
Another Sentenced Another defendant was sentenced along with Kraus on Monday.
Charles Carrasco a former member of the Del Mar Fair Board received a 90 day sentence was fined 100 and paid 10 000 in restitution Pent said.
Carrasco pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of the mails which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a 100 fine.
The restitution money will go into a fund that will be divided among the victims.
Four other defendants in the case are scheduled to be sentenced next month and in May on charges ranging from mail fraud to accessory after the fact to mail fraud.
The prosecution of another defendant has been deferred and will be dropped if he pays 30 000 in restitution and serves community service Pent said.
Yet another defendant Lynn Dale Bogart of San Diego pleaded guilty in 1986 to one count of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud.
He is serving a 10 year prison term on those charges and a separate counterfeiting charge.
LAROUCHE GETS 15 YEAR TERM IS DENIED BAIL.
A federal judge bluntly rejecting claims that the government s prosecution was politically motivated sentenced political extremist Lyndon H.
to 15 years in prison on mail and tax fraud convictions Friday and refused to release him on bail while he appeals.
imposed prison terms and fines on six LaRouche associates and ordered their immediate incarceration also.
In a courtroom exchange before sentencing Bryan dismissed as "arrant nonsense" a charge by LaRouche legal coordinator Edward Spannaus that politically motivated prosecutors were seeking to "crush LaRouche s organization.
" The notion that LaRouche s organization posed a sufficient threat to warrant prosecution "just defies human experience " the judge said.
LaRouche and his aides were convicted by a jury on Dec.
16 of bilking numerous supporters out of more than 30 million by deliberately defaulting on loans from them.
The four time independent candidate for President was also found guilty of evading federal income taxes since at least 1979.
He was accused of fraudulently having all of his personal expenses paid by various corporations that he controls and then contending that he has no taxable income.
LaRouche a former Marxist now embraces a number of causes on the far right and is noted for espousing bizarre conspiracy theories such as one linking Queen Elizabeth II and Henry A.
LaRouche had no visible reaction when the sentence was imposed.
He and the other defendants were handcuffed and led from the courthouse to a van which took them to the Alexandria city jail where they will remain until they can be assigned to a federal prison.
At the same time LaRouche was being sentenced federal prosecutors dropped all charges in a related case against LaRouche six associates and five political organizations in U.
That case involving charges that LaRouche s 1984 presidential campaign had raised more than 2 million through credit card and loan fraud ended in a mistrial last May.
attorney s office said that in view of LaRouche s conviction in Virginia further prosecution was not warranted.
In a rambling statement before he was sentenced LaRouche declared that he was "innocent of any wrongdoing.
" He said that a high ranking British intelligence official had told him that he could influence the outcome of his trial by responding to certain "unknown conditions.
" However LaRouche added he refused to bargain for justice.
LaRouche said also that his case and that Assistant U.
LaRouche 66 could have received 65 years in prison and fines totaling 3.
25 million for his conviction on 13 counts of tax and mail fraud conspiracy.
He will have to serve about 10 years of his 15 year sentence before he is eligible for parole according to a spokesman for the U.
After the sentencing about 60 LaRouche supporters gathered outside the federal courthouse here and paraded with a bed sheet banner reading the Associated Press reported.
One demonstrator wore a large mask of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and carried a Soviet flag symbolizing LaRouche s belief that he is the victim of a Soviet secret police frame up.
Supporters had sought a pardon for LaRouche from President Ronald Reagan before he left office and said that they would continue their efforts with President Bush.
LaRouche spokeswoman Dana Scanlon said that supporters planned to hold a round the clock vigil in Lafayette Park across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House until LaRouche is released from prison.
Until a few years ago it would have been highly unusual for people convicted of white collar crimes such as LaRouche to be denied bail while they awaited the outcome of their appeals.
However several defense attorneys said the practice has become relatively common of late for two reasons.
One is a 1984 change in federal sentencing law that permits immediate jailing unless there is reasonable chance of success on appeal.
The other is a growing sentiment among judges that white collar criminals should be treated the same as others.
LaRouche asked that his incarceration be postponed for 60 days so that he could undergo eye surgery but Bryan denied the request.
After the jury found him guilty on all counts last month LaRouche called his conviction that was the result of a long "campaign of hate" by the news media and friends of the Soviet Union within the federal government.
Bryan sentenced chief LaRouche fund raiser William Wertz to five years in prison and an 11 000 fine.
He gave Spannaus a five year term and a 10 000 fine.
Each of four other fund raisers Michael Billington Dennis Small Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein were sentenced to three years in prison and received lesser fines.
Federal prosecutors dropped conspiracy and fraud charges against Lyndon H.
on Friday moments before a Virginia judge sentenced the political extremist to 15 years in prison for related offenses.
All charges against LaRouche and six associates were dropped.
The Justice Department refused to drop charges against three co defendants who are fugitives.
The Boston case in which LaRouche was accused of conspiring to obstruct an investigation of an alleged 2 million credit card and loan fraud ended in a mistrial in May after five months of testimony.
LaRouche was sentenced in Alexandria Va.
to 15 years in prison for scheming to defraud federal tax collectors and deliberately failing to repay more than 30 million in loans from political supporters.
John Markham said the Justice Department felt dismissal was warranted because said Markham who handled both cases.
LaRouche who has run for President four times is known for his extreme views including support for a quarantine of AIDS victims and allegations that Britain s Queen Elizabeth is involved in drug trafficking.
JUDGE GIVES 10 YEAR PRISON TERM TO ORGANIZER OF BOGUS TAX SHELTERS.
A Huntington Beach tax adviser who orchestrated a bogus multimillion dollar tax shelter scheme drew a 10 year prison term Thursday maintaining until the end that he didn t realize that he was doing anything wrong.
Spurrier told a federal judge just before his sentence.
Spencer Letts drew a different portrait of the gray haired Mormon as about four dozen relatives of Spurrier and his six co defendants in the tax scheme listened in silence in a Santa Ana courtroom.
Letts declared as he railed against what he described as a tolerance on the part of some judges to white collar crime.
On the one hand the judge said On the other he added Spurrier duped "gullible victims" who believed that they were joining a legitimate tax shelter program.
Spurrier was convicted by a federal jury in December of tax evasion fraud and helping others file false income statements.
With associates in his Trust Management Group Spurrier attracted 5 800 people into bogus and illegal tax shelters.
1 million of that total in nontaxable "gifts" and kept a fee for the company.
Spurrier maintained throughout his trial that he did not realize what he was doing was illegal and pointed as a defense to his deep religious beliefs.
Dougherty maintained that Spurrier was convinced of his operation s legitimacy by the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints.
Spurrier faces a maximum possible sentence of 39 years in prison and a 50 000 fine.
Letts handed out a sentence that fell short of the maximum but exceeded the recommendation of probation officials.
He declined to impose a fine against the now penniless Spurrier to go along with his 10 year prison term.
The six other family members and associates implicated in the tax scheme each received lesser sentences ranging from a month in jail to several years in prison.
Belcher said he found Letts sentence to be fair but somewhat lenient especially in light of the sharp rebuke against white collar crime delivered by the judge just before sentencing.
Spurrier who remained free on bond said in an interview after the judge s decision.
Earlier in a pre sentencing statement to the judge Spurrier continued to claim innocence but added.
Letts said he would give him none adding that crimes in pursuit of money are among the most dangerous to society.
Of the defendants assertions that they were ignorant of their wrongdoing the judge said Also sentenced Thursday on a variety of tax fraud related charges were.
Spurrier s nephew Wayne Hill 34 to 30 days in jail 5 years probation a 2 000 fine and community service and Spurrier s nephew Leon G.
Hill 44 to 3 years in prison 5 years probation and an 8 000 fine.
Smith 37 who was given 6 months in prison and 5 years probation.
Amundsen 75 given 3 years in prison and 3 years probation and Amundsen s wife Eva 64 given 30 days in jail 5 years on probation and community service.
All the defendants remained free on bond pending appeals.
In taking the case to a higher court defense lawyers plan to argue in part that the prosecution was tainted by information that one juror gained from outside the trial.
MINKOW ADDICTED TO MONEY DEFENSE LAWYER TELLS COURT.
Barry Minkow was a "compulsive debtor" who had an uncontrollable need for millions of dollars the way a drug addict needs a fix his defense lawyer said Friday.
In a report filed for his sentencing Monday on 57 fraud counts stemming from the 1987 collapse of his ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company lawyers for Minkow recanted the young entrepreneur s defense that the mob forced him into committing the fraud and said Minkow was the victim of an unhappy childhood.
Stiff Sentence Sought Prosecutors in their own sentencing report called Minkow and said they will seek a sentence of at least 25 years in prison and 26 million in restitution.
The defense report recommended a sentence of from eight to 10 years and psychological counseling.
District Judge Dickran Tevrizian who will sentence Minkow has already imposed prison sentences ranging from a month to eight years for the other 10 defendants in the case.
Mafia Claim Minkow 23 was the only one who went to trial contending throughout that he was forced into fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars from banks and private investors for ZZZZ Best by a series of organized crime figures who had infiltrated the company.
Testimony in the case showed that the company s books were padded by listing millions of dollars in revenue from insurance restoration jobs supposedly repairing fire and flood damage to high rise buildings that were entirely fabricated.
Kenner said in an interview Friday that Minkow still alleges that a variety of reputed Mafia figures helped him set up the fraud and at least at first caused the young businessman to worry about not paying back his debts to them.
"A better explanation" for the role the mob figures played however is Kenner said.
In his report Kenner portrayed Minkow as the victim of a troubled childhood.
Minkow was continually berated by his father for his lack of athletic ability and often played with his sisters friends because he had no playmates his own age the report said.
His hyperactivity caused him problems in school where Minkow had "an uncontrollable need" to be the center of attention according to a psychologist s evaluation quoted in the defense report.
when the family could not pay the bill psychologist Paula Smith Marder wrote.
As a teen ager the defense said Minkow loaned others money at usurious interest rates passed bad checks and later fell under the influence in his business of reputed organized crime figures such as the late Jack Catain and "stock fraud artist" Maurice Rind who has been named by authorities as a suspect in the ZZZZ Best case but has not been charged.
But the prosecution said Minkow s lies about Mafia manipulation during his nearly two weeks of testimony the prosecution said quoting from a U.
Barry Minkow who started the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company in his parents garage and turned it into a fraudulent 100 million empire was sentenced Monday to 25 years in prison after admitting he had Minkow 23 said in a spirited speech to the judge that suggested the days when his fast talking charm and ability to inspire people made him a millionaire.
Minkow said turning to a courtroom filled with investors who were among those who lost tens of millions of dollars when ZZZZ Best collapsed in July 1987 amid allegations that the company s books were padded with phantom revenues.
District Judge Dickran Tevrizian expressing doubts about Minkow s professions of remorse imposed the prison term recommended by the prosecution and also ordered him to pay 26 million in restitution for his conviction on 57 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
The 25 year prison term was one of the longest ever handed down in Los Angeles in a white collar crime case.
Minkow will become eligible for parole after serving one third of the sentence.
Gordon Greenberg who with co prosecutor James R.
Asperger obtained the convictions of Minkow and 11 ZZZZ Best associates.
In his 10 minute statement at the sentencing hearing Minkow announced that as proof of his genuine regret over his crimes he will not appeal his Dec.
Kenner said he will file a motion to seek reconsideration of the sentence.
Minkow described by prosecutors as one of the most significant white collar criminals ever prosecuted in the West started his company at age 15 and had many of his early business meetings in the late afternoon after school.
His talkative charm and natural head for business convinced top notch accountants lawyers and investment bankers for more than two years that he had figured out a way to cheaply restore office buildings damaged by fire and flood a business that was supposedly earning ZZZZ Best up to 43 million a year from insurance companies.
ZZZZ Best also had a legitimate residential carpet cleaning enterprise eventually opening 21 offices in three states supported by television ads featuring Minkow confidently promising that his was the honest firm in a competitive field.
Within a few years Minkow with the help of several more experienced business colleagues transformed the private company into a public one and garnered nearly 13 million in a stock offering obtained millions of dollars in loans from banks across America and talked dozens of private investors even some ZZZZ Best board members who did not know what he was up to to pledge their savings with the promise of huge profits.
But as it turned out the majority of the lucrative restoration jobs never existed and neither did the revenues.
Within days of Minkow s resignation in July of 1987 ZZZZ Best collapsed leaving investors holding thousands of shares of worthless stock.
The ZZZZ Best associates convicted in the case have received sentences ranging from 30 days to eight years in prison for various roles in helping Minkow carry out the fraud.
Throughout his three month trial in Los Angeles federal court Minkow claimed he had been manipulated by mobsters and stock swindlers who had taken advantage of his youth and grabbed the hidden reins of power at his company forcing him to lie to banks and investors to keep their profits coming in.
He described being beaten until he coughed up blood and being accompanied constantly by huge thugs masquerading as bodyguards.
But making his first public statements since his nearly two week long appearance on the witness stand Minkow told the judge that he was really using the reputed mobsters with whom he was involved the same way he was using everyone else.
The "same" is true he said When he got up to address the court wearing jail issue blue trousers that were cuffed up to keep them from dragging on the ground Minkow quickly became animated waving his arms and for a moment holding the courtroom nearly spellbound.
Minkow said he exemplified what he saw as the morality of his generation.
If I took all these God given talents that I had and used them instead of for the bad for the good I d never be here today.
All the young entrepreneurs who said I want to be like Barry Minkow.
Now they re saying We can t get bank loans cause of Barry Minkow.
Don t think for a second that I don t know to the penny how many people I hurt how I m going to work for the rest of my life to pay them back Every day he d come into court and testify and every day was at variance with the previous day "the judge said.
"It was like a game show we were playing a TV game show.
Wild West He committed crimes on each and every day for more than five years.
The nature of his crimes I think is mind boggling "the federal prosecutor said.

That certainly was the reasoning Tuesday when Dennis B.
Levine the investment banker whose 1986 arrest for insider trading led to convictions of speculator Ivan F.
Boesky and others spoke of his criminal travails to UCLA graduate business students.
"It s not worth it " Levine said of insider trading and other white collar transgressions in an interview following his talk which was closed to reporters.
Levine s appearance was one of several speeches at colleges and universities he has given since he was released in last September after serving 18 months of a two year sentence on four counts of securities fraud tax evasion and perjury.
Levine s talk to students of UCLA s John E.
Anderson Graduate School of Business was his first at a West Coast institution.
Levine said he hoped that describing his prison experience and the toll it took on his wife and two young children would deter ambitious business students from illegal or unethical practices.
The former investment banker served the first few months of his sentence in a federal prison in Lewisburg Pa.
Several of the approximately 60 students in attendance said Levine described in his talk an emotional story of how he was unable to explain to his then 5 year old son why he did what he did.

A federal judge Wednesday sentenced former Singer Co.
5 million fine for the nine counts of securities and tax fraud on which he was convicted in June.
Ward said he was convinced that a prison sentence was warranted even though Bilzerian had never before been convicted of a crime because the former corporate raider had lied on the witness stand during his trial.
Bilzerian 38 had been accused of illegally amassing millions in profits from failed raids in 1985 and 1986 on Cluett Peabody Co.
He was also accused of failing to disclose a large investment in Armco Inc.
After six weeks of testimony a jury convicted him on all the counts against him.
The government had charged that Bilzerian evaded Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements and had filed false tax returns.
Bilzerian resigned as Singer s chairman within weeks after the conviction.
In addition to the prison term and fine the judge sentenced Bilzerian to two years of probation and 250 hours of community service.
Bilzerian would be eligible for parole after serving 16 months.
Depth of Despair Judge Ward however allowed Bilzerian to remain free on bail pending the outcome of an appeal.
The case was part of the series of criminal prosecutions that resulted from former stock speculator Ivan F.
During the sentencing Bilzerian showed little emotion but at times listened with his eyes closed and occasionally stared down at the table in front of him.
In a letter delivered to the judge some time before the sentencing Bilzerian had written.
Bilzerian s lawyer Arthur Mathews had argued that because his client had no previous criminal record he should be sentenced only to community service.
Mathews suggested work in a drug treatment program for children near Bilzerian s home in Tampa Fla.
But prosecutors in a document filed with the court said Bilzerian had and since his conviction had During the trial Bilzerian who holds a degree from Harvard Business School testified that he didn t know it was illegal for him not to have filed personal income tax returns for the years 1982 1983 and 1984.
He also denied that he had made illegal arrangements with the Los Angeles based brokerage firm Jefferies Co.
to secretly hold stock for him in his raid on Hammermill.
On Wednesday Judge Ward said that a statement of Bilzerian s personal finances filed with the court stated that he has a net worth of 81.
EMBEZZLER GETS 30 DAY TERM FINE.
A San Fernando Superior Court judge rejected a prosecutor s plea for a more stringent sentence Tuesday and ordered an insurance broker to spend 30 days in County Jail for embezzling clients insurance premiums.
Judge Malcolm Mackey also ordered Gary Martin 53 of Tujunga to perform 300 hours of community service imposed a 10 000 fine ordered him to pay restitution to his victims and avoid working in a capacity in which he would be responsible for other people s money.
A jury convicted Martin president of Welmar Insurance Service Sept.
18 of six felony charges for stealing about 23 000 from three clients who had paid him to buy auto insurance policies.
Ipsen had urged that Martin be sentenced to two years in prison but Mackey said the community would be better served if Martin worked and paid restitution.
Failing Business Mackey described Martin who used the money to pay the operating expenses of his ailing insurance company as a small businessman who got in financial trouble and did not deserve to be punished as if he had set up a business deliberately to defraud people.
But Ipsen said Martin whose broker s license previously had been suspended for six months for misusing funds got off too lightly.
The prosecutor said the sentence reflects the court system s leniency toward white collar criminals.
No Criminal Record But the Los Angeles County Probation Department agreed with the judge s assessment.
It had recommended that Martin not be sentenced to state prison noting that he has no criminal record.
After his conviction Martin told a county probation officer that he was innocent.
He said the theft was planned by his former partner Clark Wells who pleaded guilty to two charges of theft in 1987 and was sentenced to three years probation.
Martin was arrested in June 1987 after a San Fernando businessman tried to add a car to an insurance policy that Martin had been paid to buy.
The insurance company notified the businessman that the policy had been canceled for non payment.
DESPITE WARNINGS ABOUT 4 BILLION IN RETIREMENT INCOME MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY RACKETEERS.
When his wife fell gravely ill George Hohol wanted to quit his job as a welder so he could get his pension money to pay her soaring medical bills.
But she begged him to keep working so they would have health insurance.
Hohol stayed on the job but his health insurance was canceled a few months later without warning because his employer had stopped paying the premium.
Then the paychecks started to bounce and finally the company closed in late 1986.
When Hohol tried to get the 29 000 accumulated in his pension plan over 22 years he got excuses and delays instead.
Ultimately he learned the money was gone lost in an elaborate fraud scheme by the owner and a lawyer for the small company DuPage Boiler Works in the Chicago suburb of Naperville.
Hohol a proud man who came to the United States from Poland after spending World War II in German labor camps was 52 000 in debt and had been on unemployment for the first time in his life when his wife died in 1987.
Hohol and his wife were victims of what a federal official describes as businessmen and lawyers who exploit weak government regulation to misuse and steal the retirement income of workers across the country.
Labor Department according to its acting inspector general has proved powerless to deter abuse or to bring the wrongdoers to justice.
The inspector general estimates that 4 billion in pension funds are being misused but in reality no one knows how deep the problem is.
said Raymond Maria the acting inspector general.
Most pension plans the experts say are run honestly.
And many pension plans but by no means all are federally insured in case the money runs out.
Most abuse is found among relatively small employers the same ones that are least likely to be covered by federal insurance.
The wrongdoers include small business owners who can t resist dipping into pension funds such as a California construction company where 227 000 in pension funds was used to run the business.
And they include those who appear intent on looting the funds from the start such as a New Mexico potash mine owner accused of siphoning off 9 million in worker retirement funds to pay personal debts and finance a lavish life style.
The enormous size of today s pension funds makes them attractive targets for the unobserved and the unscrupulous.
Assets in private pension funds tripled in the last 10 years to 1.
7 trillion about 7 000 for every man woman and child in the country.
More than 76 million workers and retirees are covered by a pension plan.
But internal government audits interviews and court records raise questions about whether the federal government s ability to keep this vast pool of money safe for workers has kept pace with the mushrooming growth.
Labor Department agency responsible for monitoring the nation s 870 000 pension plans has only 260 auditors and investigators assigned to the task.
The least attention goes to the most vulnerable plans the small ones that are not supervised by the outside auditors and layers of lawyers hired by large corporations.
Congress and the Labor Department inspector general s office the internal watchdog that is supposed to make sure the department is doing its job have issued repeated warnings about the inadequate resources.
In 1986 a Senate committee concluded that inadequate staffing has dangerously compromised the department s ability to protect worker pensions.
And earlier this year a study of 168 plans by the inspector general s office uncovered 18.
At that rate the office said there would be 4 billion worth of fraud and abuse systemwide.
Not long ago the problem was far worse.
Before Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974 only a minuscule 3 of workers received the full benefits to which they were entitled.
The 1974 law put the Labor Department s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration in charge of monitoring pension plans.
In 1978 when Jimmy Carter was President the office conducted 8 598 reviews and investigations.
By 1988 the figure had plummeted to 1 632 despite the threefold increase in pension fund assets.
A PWBA spokeswoman explained that the agency has undertaken larger more sophisticated cases in recent years.
The agency concentrates on the largest 5 of the plans which hold roughly 90 of pension assets.
The 93 of the plans with fewer than 100 participants are least likely to be reviewed and they are not required to hire outside auditors to ensure that the money is being handled legally.
Ferguson director of the Pension Rights Center an advocacy group for workers based in Washington.
Government regulators such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission try to maximize limited resources through criminal prosecutions that send a strong message of deterrence.
But the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration relies almost entirely on civil and administrative sanctions.
Of the PWBA s 5 000 investigations in the last three years only 95 were classified as criminal and only 26 convictions resulted.
Maria the acting inspector general contends this strategy reassures would be pension pillagers.
The worst that will happen in the unlikely event they are caught is likely to be a civil fine.
Pension fund regulation today the inspector general s office and others argue is comparable to the woeful monitoring that contributed to the collapse of the savings and loan industry a debacle expected to cost taxpayers at least 150 billion.
which was set up by the 1974 ERISA law to insure workers pensions has a deficit of 4 billion the difference between what they owe pensioners and what they can expect to receive in the form of employer premiums.
3 billion in pension obligations left by the 1986 bankruptcy of LTV Corp.
Although the PBGC has gone to court against LTV in a fight over responsibility for making the pension payments it has also been making the payments for the last three years.
In 1987 for the first time the PBGC paid out more money to cover pension obligations than it collected in employer premiums.
The General Accounting Office an investigative arm of Congress warned that the fund would be broke unable to meet its current obligations by 2001.
Congress reacted by increasing the insurance premium paid by employers now the sole source of revenue for the PBGC.
But PBGC officials are still concerned about potential problems with under funded pension plans in big industries such as the airlines.
The Labor Department s inspector general s office says a major shortfall could ultimately land in the taxpayers laps just as Congress turned to the taxpayers after another government insurance agency fell short of the funds it needed to pay insured depositors at failed S Ls.
Pension fund system representatives and some Labor Department officials say such concerns are exaggerated.
Lebowitz deputy assistant secretary for operations at the PWBA.
Nonetheless the Labor Department recently informed Congress that it was considering tighter regulations on audits by outside accountants one of the recommendations from the inspector general.
Although he maintained that corruption has been restricted to a small number of pension plans Lebowitz acknowledged.
Paychecks from DuPage Boiler Works the company where her husband like George Hohol had worked for 22 years were getting tough to cash.
The local bank refused to honor them and she had to be on the doorstep of the bank that issued the checks early in the morning to get them cashed before funds in the account ran out.
For a half century DuPage Boiler Works had run smoothly if somewhat modestly.
And if the hourly pay was less than other places the workers were reminded every year that the company was setting money aside for them in a pension fund.
But in October 1984 the company had been sold to a man who identified himself as Robert Caldwell.
He had big plans and built a fancy new office to go with them.
He was driven to work in a limousine and gave the workers free turkeys the first Thanksgiving and again that Christmas.
Only later would they discover that their pensions had probably financed that generosity.
Within two weeks of taking over Caldwell had begun raiding the profit sharing account according to court records.
He had 350 000 transferred to another account and used some of the money to pay debts of another company he owned.
Some of it went to such expenditures as a fur coat for himself and 45 000 worth of clothes for his wife according to Joan B.
Caldwell was actually Morton Scherl a white collar criminal with an arrest record dating to the mid 1960s in Los Angeles.
When he bought DuPage Boiler using the company s own money for the purchase he was a fugitive wanted in New York Massachusetts and Florida.
Goodstein a Chicago lawyer had wiped out DuPage Boiler s 741 000 profit sharing account.
About 35 000 had gone in small amounts to retiring workers to silence their complaints about not getting their pensions.
The rest court records show went to Scherl and Goodstein and a variety of their businesses.
In sucking the cash out of DuPage Scherl had also stopped paying the utility bills or paying for raw material.
And even though money was still being deducted from paychecks he stopped paying withheld taxes to the IRS and cancelled the health insurance.
For seven months in 1986 Jeanette Kurns tried to get someone to take a look at what was going on at DuPage.
She wrote to President Ronald Reagan the Labor Department the IRS and various state agencies.
She has a large blue binder filled with her futile correspondence and notes of her telephone conversations.
Wives of other workers also were urging the Labor Department to look into the problems with similar results.
Charles Lerner the PWBA enforcement director refused to comment directly on the DuPage Boiler case.
But he said citizen complaints are one source for the agency s investigations of pension fund problems.
attorney s office began to investigate DuPage Boiler Works in the fall of 1986.
That October an IRS agent approached Scherl in the coffee shop of a Sheraton Hotel outside Chicago and told him he was under arrest.
Scherl dashed through the hotel kitchen into the parking lot and fled.
It was a year and a half before he was captured in Baltimore where he was in the midst of another scheme.
Scherl recently pleaded guilty in federal court in Chicago to misusing DuPage Boiler s pension funds and other charges and is awaiting sentencing.
Goodstein the lawyer was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison.
At Goodstein s trial George Hohol and Jeanette Kurns were among several witnesses who testified about the financial hardship resulting from the pension fraud.
Safford a veteran prosecutor with a reputation for toughness was so upset by Hohol s story that she left the courtroom to avoid crying in front of the jury.
Witnesses also described their frustrations with the Labor Department prompting the presiding judge Charles P.
Kocoras to offer lawyers in the case his view on the department s response.
was established by the ERISA law to insure the pensions of workers and retirees.
If employers do not provide enough money to cover promised benefits when a plan is ended the agency will pay them up to a ceiling that is now set at 2 028 a month.
However the PBGC insures only what are called defined benefit plans which promise a specific monthly benefit at retirement.
As a result only 107 500 of the 870 000 pension plans are insured although the covered plans represent 40 million workers and retirees out of the 76 million enrolled in pension plans.
Defined contribution plans whose ultimate pension benefit is not predetermined are not insured by the PBGC.
Most common among these are profit sharing plans employee stock ownership plans and 401(k) savings plans.
Lockhart executive director of the PBGC said the percentage of workers covered by defined benefit plans has declined steadily in the 1980s.
More worrisome to Lockhart is the fact that most new pension plans are defined contribution plans which are not insured by the government.
The DuPage Boiler Works profit sharing plan was not insured.
After the company closed its doors a court appointed trustee for the pension plan recovered enough during bankruptcy proceedings to pay workers about 80 of their pensions.
But the faith of people like Jeanette Kurns was shaken badly.
Lerner the PWBA enforcement director said the agency has tried to cover more plans by focusing its enforcement on financial consultants who advise multiple plans and on financial institutions that hold the assets of many plans.
But an examination of cases against consultants and financial businesses in recent years raises doubts about the agency s effectiveness in this arena.
Last May the department filed a civil lawsuit against the New York brokerage house Shearson Lehman Hutton two smaller investment firms three former brokers and several fund trustees.
The defendants played a role in managing 560 million belonging to several Teamsters Union pension and welfare plans in Utica N.
The suit which is pending charged that the plans lost money in a scheme in which the brokers bought stocks and placed them in a holding account for several days.
Losing trades were assigned to pension fund accounts and profitable trades went into the accounts of friends relatives and other customers including some plan trustees the suit contends.
But this was not a case of the Labor Department s ferreting out alleged wrongdoing.
The lawsuit followed a 6 year old criminal investigation by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission which had already led to guilty pleas by three brokers.
The department was equally late in the case of Glen E.
a former IRS auditor who invested funds for about 200 small pension funds and drove a Mercedes Benz sports car bearing a license plate reading "ERISA.
" Dawson who handled pension investments for doctors and accountants promised high returns for the pension funds of the professionals and their employees.
ERISA prohibits those responsible for pension money from accepting fees for investing the funds in a particular institution.
But for several years according to a lawsuit filed in Baltimore Dawson invested pension fund assets with companies that paid him substantial commissions and fees in return.
One client a Midwestern accountant said he was questioned by a Labor Department investigator in 1983 about Dawson s operation.
The accountant said he provided a sworn statement to a department lawyer that year but never heard anything further and kept using Dawson.
Dawson stayed in business until outside events intervened.
He was also chairman of a Baltimore savings and loan association and the state seized the S L in December 1985 because it was insolvent.
Court records show that the S L had lent Dawson 105 000 and that he had invested pension fund money in the thrift when it was struggling to survive what Maryland regulators charged was "gross mismanagement and plundering" by its officers including Dawson.
In August 1986 the Labor Department filed a civil lawsuit accusing Dawson of violating ERISA.
Court files indicate the pension plans operated by Dawson which were uninsured had lost up to 1 million in what the lawsuit called a pattern of unlawful transactions covering seven years and 130 plans.
Last year a federal judge banned Dawson from the pension business and ordered him to repay the plans a total of 70 000 in restitution.
Dawson had filed for bankruptcy earlier and a lawyer in the case said 70 000 was about all he had left by the time the Labor Department got to him.
FLORIDA RESTAURANT LOAN SCHEME GOES SOUR.
Law enforcement authorities say pension fund officials who have little loyalty to their members are especially vulnerable to the sort of approach that Florida businessman Leonard J.
Lauderdale hotel owner told Higgins that he needed 375 000 to purchase the Ta Boo a Palm Beach restaurant.
He had been retained by New Jersey Teamsters Local 701 to invest 20 million worth of union pension funds in residential and commercial loans.
But Higgins told Mercer that union rules which were designed to protect members restricted how Higgins company Omni Funding Group Inc.
In particular no funds could be placed in high risk ventures such as bars restaurants and bowling alleys.
According to federal court records Mercer then devised a scheme for Omni Funding to advance him the money under the guise that it would be used to refinance his hotel.
Omni provided the loan and submitted false reports about it to the Teamsters local which forwarded them to the U.
In return Mercer paid 42 500 in kickbacks to Higgins in the form of cash free hotel suites meals and other gifts.
Reporting false information about pension fund loans is a violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act which Congress passed in 1974 to tighten up supervision over pension funds.
Acting on an insider s tip the Labor Department s Office of Labor Racketeering in conjunction with the U.
attorney s office in Miami launched a criminal investigation into Mercer and Higgins that led to guilty pleas by both men and their eventual imprisonment.
Mercer pleaded guilty to kickback charges as well as perjury for lying to a federal grand jury when he testified that Higgins had paid for his stays at Galt Ocean Mile Hotel which Mercer owned.
Identified by the Pennsylvania Crime Commission as a longtime associate of Philadelphia mob figures Mercer received four years in prison and a 40 000 fine.
In a separate court appearance Higgins pleaded guilty to perjury wire fraud and mail fraud and was sentenced to eight years in prison.
Two trustees and two lawyers for the Teamsters New Jersey pension fund also were eventually implicated in similar corrupt dealings with Higgins.
One of those implicated pleaded guilty and the other three were convicted of racketeering and mail fraud.
Before he went off to jail last spring his hotel and restaurant went bankrupt.
LEONA HELMSLEY GETS 4 YEARS AND 7 MILLION FINE.
Leona Helmsley the self proclaimed queen of a luxury hotel chain was sentenced Tuesday to four years in federal prison and fined 7.
1 million by a judge who said her criminal tax offenses were the product of "naked greed.
" The judge imposed the sentence after Helmsley 69 tearfully begged for mercy.
told Helmsley that she had He noted that her crime wasn t motivated by financial need and said that since her conviction she had shown no remorse.
Helmsley and two employees were convicted in August on 33 felony counts related to evasion of 1.
2 million in federal income taxes including Helmsley s diversion of funds from the real estate and hotel companies that she and her husband controlled in order to pay for lavish personal expenditures.
Helmsley s trial drew intense media interest.
She became a symbol of upper class abuse of privilege when a former housekeeper testified that Mrs.
In addition Walker sentenced Helmsley to three years of probation including 750 hours of community service at Hale House a home for infants born addicted to drugs.
The judge ordered her to pay the federal taxes she owes plus penalties and interest and 469 000 in New York state taxes.
The judge allowed her to remain free on bail pending an appeal with the amount of bail to be determined later.
Should her appeals fail and she be sent to prison she would be eligible for parole after serving a year and three months.
As she and her husband Harry 80 left the courthouse Tuesday members of a crowd that had gathered outside shouted "Whore.
" and Attracted by what promised to be one of the great courtroom scenes of the year scores of would be spectators had stood in line for over an hour to get inside.
Helmsley renowned from magazine ads in which she appeared as the perfectionist queen of the Helmsley Hotels chain attended court in a long sleeved black mock turtleneck dress with a drop waist and loose pleats.
When the judge asked her if she had anything to say she stood but had trouble getting her words out because of sobs.
Helmsley said that because of the case s extensive publicity she and her husband had been virtual prisoners in their home for three years unable to leave because they might be attacked or jeered.
" She referred to her continuing grief for her son who died in 1982 and then spoke of Harry who has been judged mentally incompetent and whom she has been taking care of.
" Harry Helmsley the founder of a New York real estate and hotel empire estimated to be worth 5 billion had been indicted along with his wife.
But he was later judged unfit to stand trial because of failing memory and didn t appear at all in court during the trial.
Harry Helmsley attended Tuesday s sentencing flanked by three bodyguards.
But afterward he showed no sign of having fully understood the proceedings.
When a friend offered support and told him soothingly that his wife was unlikely to begin her sentence "for years and years " until the appeals process is exhausted Helmsley laughed and repeated "years and years.
Helmsley turned to friends in the courtroom including television personality Barbara Walters and said.
Helmsley s attorney Gerald Feffer acknowledged that she deserved to be punished for her crimes.
But he noted in court that his client will soon turn 70 and said she has already been severely punished by the humiliation and abuse she has suffered at the hands of the press and public.
Feffer said Helmsley had received death threats as well as voluminous hate mail much of it obscene and anti Semitic.
He said her position and notoriety mean that she would be a target of physical abuse in prison.
Feffer had asked the judge to sentence her to perform community service at Hale House.
Feffer told the judge that if he felt that punishment wasn t severe enough he could also sentence Helmsley to live in Harlem in one of Hale House s residential facilities for mothers recovering from addiction.
This Feffer said would place her in When he pronounced sentence Judge Walker said that in making up his mind he had focused only on her crimes ignoring Helmsley s "vilification" in the press as well as testimony that she was sometimes cold hearted and vindictive in her treatment of employees.

According to testimony in the trial she used company funds to pay credit card bills for underwear and other clothing from department stores a 45 000 silver clock specially designed in the shape of the Helmsley Building in New York and a leg waxing.
The Helmsleys failed to disclose the money as personal income as tax laws require.
The trial included testimony about her blithely firing household employees at Christmastime for petty infractions and demanding cash kickbacks from firms that supplied liquor to the Helmsley hotels.
But in arguing for a lenient sentence her lawyer presented letters from several other Helmsley employees for whom Mrs.
Helmsley had gone out of her way to assure adequate medical treatment including two who had AIDS.
Helmsley born Leona Mindy Rosenthal came from a modest background the daughter of a Brooklyn hat maker.
She had had several careers before she met and married Harry Helmsley including being a showroom model cigarette vendor and later a successful Manhattan real estate broker.
Helmsley and her husband still face similar tax charges in New York state court.
They have pleaded not guilty and a ruling is expected on whether Harry Helmsley is mentally competent to stand trial on the state charges.
Several Helmsley hotels in New York face loss of their liquor licenses because of Mrs.
Judge Walker told the defendants that their attempts to cheat the government on which the nation s tax system depends.
He said that the sentences should send a message to anyone thinking of falsifying a tax return that The two employees who had been convicted with her also were sentenced Tuesday to prison terms and fines.

Their lawyers said they don t intend to appeal and the two are to begin their sentences on Jan.
Turco has already pleaded guilty to state charges and Licari is expected to do so today.
OBERMAIER HAS DOUBTS ABOUT USING RICO IN INVESTMENT FRAUD CASES.
attorney in Manhattan bristles at suggestions that his appointment will mark a letup in the 4 year old crackdown on Wall Street fraud.
Before a reporter can even finish asking him what his new reign will mean for criminal prosecution of insider trading and securities fraud Obermaier 53 jumps in.
Giuliani a zealous and publicity hungry prosecutor who launched an unprecedented wave of criminal cases against major Wall Street figures before he stepped down last year to make a losing run at becoming New York City s mayor.
Giuliani won praise for bringing law enforcement into an area that had become corrupt and for raising the standards of conduct on Wall Street.
But by the end of his five year tenure Giuliani was also reviled by interests as diverse as the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page and the American Civil Liberties Union.
The accusations included making promiscuous use of the harsh racketeering law known as RICO bringing criminal charges for offenses that previously had been handled only under civil law and ordering highly publicized arrests even though his office wasn t fully prepared to bring a case.
Obermaier by contrast is regarded as a thoughtful intellectual lawyer without political ambitions described by one friend as more a diplomat than a crusader.
He comes to the job after 19 years in private practice much of it spent representing the type of white collar defendants he now must prosecute.
He is on record criticizing the use of RICO the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in securities fraud cases.
In published articles he has expressed doubts about whether insider trading cases should be prosecuted as criminal offenses.
And his appointee to head the criminal division in his office Gerard E.
Lynch 38 a former Columbia University law professor was one of the most prominent scholarly critics of RICO particularly its use in white collar crime cases.
Despite Obermaier s long tenure as a defense lawyer current and former prosecutors praise him as a first rate lawyer and say they don t doubt his commitment to tough prosecution.
They note that before he went into private practice in 1970 he was the chief trial lawyer in the Securities and Exchange Commission s New York office and before that he was an assistant U.
Nevertheless many white collar defense attorneys and other legal authorities in New York say they expect a change in approach under Obermaier.
They expect more thoughtful consideration of specific charges before an indictment is brought.
They also say it is probable that there won t be any flashy arrests designed for television cameras and that leaks about pending investigations may be less likely.
a Columbia law professor and friend of Obermaier s said he expects that under Obermaier there will be rather than criminal indictments.
Giuliani was widely criticized for bringing major felony charges against individuals who some claimed were guilty only of marginal infractions and Coffee says that under Obermaier this may be less likely.
But he predicts that Obermaier s term won t bring any relief for big league crooks.
Referring to former stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky and former investment banker Dennis B.
Levine both of whom pleaded guilty to insider trading related charges Coffee says.
Obermaier himself as the man whose many duties include being the top federal cop on Wall Street asserts that he is in fact contemplating no big changes at all.
In an interview Obermaier seems slightly ill at ease and reveals little about himself.
He says that his office the second largest U.
Attorney s Office in the country after the District of Columbia s is a "proud institution.
" Obermaier also declines to respond in any detail to the main criticism of him as U.
attorney the fact that his old law firm Obermaier Morvillo Abramovitz represented so many prominent defendants in matters under investigation by the U.
Attorney s Office that he will have to "recuse" himself from a long list of cases that is disqualify himself from having anything to do with them and turn supervision over to a subordinate.
It was because of this that Giuliani initially opposed Obermaier s nomination.
Obermaier maintains that the recusals won t have any impact at all on how cases are managed.
But the impact is unclear because Obermaier refuses to disclose how many cases he has recused himself from.
It is known that Obermaier has disqualified himself from the big case pending against former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
junk bond chief Michael Milken as well as from the pending real estate racketeering case against Imelda Marcos wife of the late former Philippines president.
One of his law partners had represented her co defendant Adnan M.
Mulheren who is due to go on trial soon on criminal securities fraud charges.
Pete Romatowski a Washington securities lawyer who spent six years as an assistant federal prosecutor in New York says Obermaier s recusals inevitably will hurt.
Romatowski praises Obermaier but said the recusals mean he won t be able to have final say on which charges are brought or negotiate plea agreements.
Most of the cases from which Obermaier has disqualified himself apparently will be supervised by Roger S.
Hayes who joined the office in November as chief deputy U.
Before he was a judge Hayes worked in the Manhattan district attorney s office and he served for a time as head of the trial division.
But his only experience in the federal system was during law school when he worked as a student intern in the U.
Knowledgeable sources said Hayes was given his new high ranking job because his long association with the office of Manhattan District Atty.
Robert Morgenthau will help Obermaier avoid turf battles with the city prosecutor.
Although Obermaier insists that he intends to change nothing about the office at least one difference is already apparent.
Obermaier has made clear that he has little interest in cultivating the press.
Whereas Giuliani at times held two press conferences a day as U.
attorney Obermaier who took office more than two months ago has held none.
Ira Glasser executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union says of Obermaier.
Both Obermaier and Morvillo his former partner are on record challenging aspects of RICO including the financial forfeiture provision which they have suggested gives prosecutors too much power.
And Obermaier in a column on white collar crime that appeared in the New York Law Journal in 1986 openly questioned the filing of criminal charges in some insider trading cases.
he seemed to indicate that he wasn t personally convinced that insider trading should be considered a crime.
Although he didn t take an explicit stand in the article he noted that Obermaier asserts that whatever views he may have expressed earlier won t have any effect on how cases are handled.
But on RICO he does allow that The RICO controversy came to the fore in the Giuliani years because of its use in the case against Drexel Burnham and in a related case against a much smaller securities firm Princeton Newport Limited Partners.
In the Princeton Newport case criticism centered on whether the racketeering law originally enacted by Congress as a means of fighting organized crime should be applied to what Giuliani s critics contended were only relatively minor tax law violations.
In the Drexel case some legal authorities raised the issue of whether the pretrial forfeiture of assets allowed under RICO forced the firm to settle the charges by pleading guilty to six criminal charges rather than by trying to exonerate itself in a trial.
RICO they charged was being used as a bludgeon to force a company to plead guilty since the forfeiture provision meant that the firm might go out of business even before a trial could be held.
In the Princeton Newport case six defendants were ultimately convicted of racketeering offenses for temporarily transferring the ownership of stocks and bonds to claim illegal tax benefits.
As it happened Obermaier s firm represented one of the defendants.
Princeton Newport did go out of business before a trial was held.
Defense lawyers attributed this to the fact that prosecutors were able to freeze much of the firm s assets under RICO.
But prosecutors received what was widely viewed as a sharp de facto rebuke when the judge who presided over the case sentenced the defendants to just a few months in prison and ruled that four of the defendants wouldn t have to forfeit any of their salary or profits from the partnership.
This was in contrast with the lengthy sentences and heavy financial forfeiture permitted under RICO.
The judge found that given the relatively minor nature of the offenses anything harsher would have amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.
Lynch the new head of the criminal division in a lengthy law review article published in 1987 challenged recent uses of RICO.
In the article titled one of his main criticisms was that the law could be interpreted so broadly that even minor offenses could be considered a pattern of racketeering activity.
But Lynch also said that his criticisms were based mainly on academic concerns and that if anything he has to be on guard against a personal bias against white collar criminals.
He also said it would be wrong to assume that as a prosecutor he won t make use of every available tool including RICO.
Meanwhile outward appearances indicate that the pace of major securities fraud indictments has slackened considerably since the heady days of 1987 and 1988.
Then using information obtained from Boesky Giuliani and his staff brought charges against former Los Angeles brokerage chief Boyd L.
Lynch says that more than anything else the pace of prosecutions has and will depend on what wrongdoing rank and file prosecutors stumble onto.
attorney s securities fraud unit will soon receive several additional assistant prosecutors.
For his part Alan Cohen head of the unit said.
Obermaier and his former partner are on record challenging aspects of RICO including the financial forfeiture provision which they have suggested gives prosecutors too much power.
And Obermaier has openly questioned the filing of criminal charges in some insider trading cases.
A San Diego man was sentenced to 15 months in prison Monday for helping his bosses swindle 6 million from investors who bought old coins from an Orange County business.
Brian Thompson 28 formerly of Orange had pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud stemming from his activities as sales administrator of the now defunct Marco Numismatics which operated in Costa Mesa from 1985 to 1988 said Assistant U.
Spencer Letts sitting in Santa Ana ordered Thompson to pay 7 000 restitution Umberg said.
The sentencing ends a case that saw seven men found guilty of federal crimes linked to the scam.
The father son team that ran the business Vincent L.
Caterino 29 of Costa Mesa were sentenced to prison this month for masterminding the high pressure phone sales operation.
They were convicted of conspiracy mail fraud and wire fraud.
Salesmen persuaded investors to buy rare or old coins that were vastly overvalued.
2 OWNERS OF FAILED S L GET STIFF SENTENCES.
Two Orange County businessmen convicted of causing the collapse of Ramona Savings Loan in Santa Ana received severe prison sentences Tuesday in federal court in Los Angeles and were ordered to pay millions of dollars in restitution to the government.
53 of Huntington Beach was sentenced to 15 years in prison and John L.
Molinaro 49 of San Jose received a 12 year sentence on charges of fraud and conspiracy that led to the thrift s 1986 collapse.
8 million in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
The two men were convicted in October on more than 30 counts of bank fraud and conspiracy.
Neither man showed any reaction as Kenyon read the sentences.
Molinaro dressed in a wrinkled blue work shirt and prison fatigues leaned back in his chair.
The men will be eligible for parole in four to five years.
The prosecution said it was pleased with Kenyon s decision.
Defense attorneys expressed little surprise at the length of the sentences claiming that Kenyon was under pressure from regulators to set an example.
Kenyon had received letters from the nation s top banking regulators including FDIC Chairman L.
William Seidman appealing for long prison terms for both men.
The Ramona case has attracted a great deal of attention because Molinaro and Mangano were the first owners of a failed thrift in Southern California to face criminal charges since the nation s thrift debacle began to unfold in the late 1980s.
The 2 1 2 hour sentencing proceeding became rather delicate when the subject became Mangano s deteriorating health.
He is a quadriplegic the victim of a bout with polio more than 30 years ago and his attorneys have claimed that any kind of incarceration could result in his death.
Mangano s attorneys pleaded with Kenyon on Tuesday to place him on probation.
DAVID EXECUTIVE GETS 10 YEAR TERM FOR EVADING TAXES.
Nancy Hoover Hunter convicted of four counts of tax evasion in connection with the J.
investment fraud was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in federal prison.
Hunter 51 a former top executive with the failed La Jolla investment firm begged U.
Gilliam for mercy crying and holding on to a lectern for support as she said she was Hunter s attorneys had pleaded with Gilliam to view her conviction apart from the complicated J.
But Gilliam said the case was The judge added Gilliam who could have sentenced Hunter to 20 years in prison added a five year probation term after the 10 year prison sentence concludes.
The judge said he was not ready to consider when Hunter would be eligible for parole.
David fraud involved a Ponzi scheme in which money from new investors was used to pay off old investors and little actual trading was done.
Prosecutors allege that Hunter created false documents to lure investors to J.
David and then to lull them into staying put while the firm slid toward a bankruptcy that was declared in February 1984.
Hunter s former lover firm founder J.
David (Jerry) Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to fraud and tax evasion in connection with the scheme and is serving a 20 year sentence in federal prison.
It acquitted her of one other tax charge but deadlocked on 192 other counts primarily fraud and conspiracy stemming from her role at J.
The tax charges involved nearly 2 million that Hunter failed to report on her personal income taxes for the years 1980 through 1983 evading nearly 1 million in taxes.
At the trial Hunter said Dominelli had assured her he would take care of any tax.
Prosecutors have said they intend to go to trial again on the 192 counts.
When the second trial ends Hunter faces yet another trial on securities violations connected to the J.
FAIRY TALE ENDS AS JURY CONVICTS EX NORTH AMERICA OFFICIAL ON RACKETEERING AND CONSPIRACY CHARGES.
Janet Faye McKinzie was convicted Thursday of looting the now defunct North America Savings Loan ending what had once been a fairy tale existence of Rolls Royces 1 000 cocktail dresses and lavish parties with entertainment provided by the likes of Sammy Davis Jr.
A jury of six men and six women deliberated eight days in U.
District Court before finding McKinzie guilty of 22 of 26 counts including racketeering conspiracy bank fraud wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property.
During the eight week trial defense attorney Richard (Racehorse) Haynes portrayed McKinzie as a helpless victim duped into carrying out the fraud because she was being pumped full of prescription drugs by the thrift s chairman Duayne Christensen.
Christensen mysteriously died in a car accident only nine hours before federal regulators took over the thrift in 1987.
The former dentist was named an unindicted co conspirator in McKinzie s case.
Federal prosecutors had portrayed the couple as a modern day Bonnie and Clyde stealing millions of dollars from North America to enrich themselves.
And McKinzie spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at Neiman Marcus much of it after regular store hours as a preferred customer.
FBI agents found that the pair had spent 125 000 on a gold eagle statue 18 500 on a letter opener and 500 on a gold paper clip.
McKinzie s 37th birthday in 1986 was celebrated with a dinner for hundreds of guests at the Newport Beach Marriott.
was on hand to sing a mix of tunes including "Happy Birthday.
" McKinzie officially was a consultant to North America.
She was also Christensen s business manager and confidante.
Prosecutors however say she was the thrift s de facto chairman.
The collapse of North America one of several Orange County thrifts to fail in recent years eventually cost taxpayers more than 120 million.
said William Davis chief deputy of the California Department of Savings and Loan.
McKinzie is the first person to be convicted under the RICO statute the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in connection with a savings and loan failure on the West Coast.
Federal prosecutors employed the RICO statute so the government could try to claim the proceeds from Christensen s 10 million life insurance policy which named McKinzie as sole beneficiary.
The jury in the McKinzie case is scheduled to reconvene next month to decide if she must forfeit that money to the U.
The money is currently being held in a government controlled escrow account.
Because the jury still has some unfinished business both prosecutors and defense attorneys were reluctant to say much Thursday.
Seave would only say they were pleased with the verdict.
Essmyer Haynes co counsel expressed disappointment.
McKinzie had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity a highly unusual plea in a white collar crime case.
Haynes one of the nation s leading defense attorneys repeatedly told jurors that McKinzie was "a washed out zombie" simply following Christensen s orders.
Hundreds of prescriptions were introduced as evidence indicating that McKinzie was taking massive doses of drugs that included anti anxiety medications such as Xanax.
During closing arguments two weeks ago Haynes said Christensen was the Jim Jones of the savings and loan industry a reference to the cult religious figure who led 900 of his followers in a mass suicide in Guyana.
The defense even showed jurors pictures of McKinzie before and after her relationship with Christensen.
McKinzie didn t even drink coffee before she met Christensen Essmyer said.
Christensen died in 1987 when his Jaguar crashed into an overpass piling on the Corona del Mar Freeway.
The Orange County coroner classified the cause of his death as undetermined failing to rule on whether it was an accident or suicide.
Jurors sided with the government which said McKinzie was fully aware of what she was doing.
Federal prosecutors focused exclusively during the trial on two schemes that they claimed McKinzie directed personally.
According to the prosecution an escrow accounts fraud succeeded in bilking North America of 11 million between August 1985 and March 1986.
The thrift s board of directors approved the deposit of millions of dollars in what they thought were escrow accounts to be used by McKinzie to purchase properties with the help of a real estate speculator named David L.
McKinzie went so far as to order an underling to get blank stationery from the two banks where the deposits were supposedly held.
Shortly thereafter North America executives received letters that appeared to be from the banks reassuring them that the deposits were safe and sound.
The letters were forgeries done at McKinzie s instruction and the 11 million was long gone by the time they arrived in North America s mailbox.
One letter purportedly written by the manager of one of the two banks even praised McKinzie.
" The second scam McKinzie engineered jurors were told involved two residential projects that North America was financing.
Using old invoices from those projects McKinzie instructed secretaries to white out key information such as dates and amount paid and put in new information including much larger amounts due.
6 million worth of checks based on those phony invoices some of which went directly to McKinzie and Christensen.
The two even formed a shell company called Central State Construction which was used as a funnel for some of the ill gotten gains the prosecution said.
McKinzie along with several other officers and directors at North America still faces a civil lawsuit brought by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
FSLIC attorney Eric Isken said the agency has no plans to drop its action.
The failure of North America was one of the more unusual of a series of savings and loan collapses in Orange County in the 1980s.
Just last month two Orange County businessmen were sentenced after convictions of fraud and conspiracy that led to the 1986 collapse of Ramona Savings Loan in Santa Ana.
They received prison terms of 27 years between them and were ordered to pay 6.
8 million in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
And numerous criminal and civil investigations are under way involving Irvine based Lincoln Savings Loan.

HELMSLEY ASKS THE STATE TO DROP TAX EVASION CHARGES.
A lawyer for Leona Helmsley urged a judge Thursday to dismiss state tax evasion charges against the self styled hotel queen and prove that there is not Dabbing her eyes and nose with a tissue Helmsley sobbed softly as her attorney Sandor Frankel said his client had been Helmsley 70 was convicted of federal tax fraud and sentenced last fall to a four year prison term.
Helmsley now faces prosecution for allegedly cheating on her state taxes.
She is accused of disguising millions of dollars in renovations at her Greenwich Conn.
mansion as business expenses incurred by the hotel empire that she and her husband Harry run.
Outside state Supreme Court in Manhattan Helmsley told reporters she was being unfairly pursued by prosecutors because of her celebrity status.
She said she would fight the charges and prove her innocence.
She burst into tears again and her team of eight lawyers and a handful of bodyguards rushed her toward her gray limousine.
Harry Helmsley 81 who was ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial in the federal case is expected to undergo a competency examination in April in the state case.
On Thursday Frankel urged Justice John Bradley to dismiss charges against Helmsley saying they were improper because they grew out of immunized testimony she gave to a 1985 grand jury investigating sales tax evasion.
He also said the state charges were based on the same allegations as the federal charges and therefore represent double jeopardy.
He said Helmsley s conviction on federal tax charges combined with her state charges on tax evasion gives the impression Frankel said the public has already gotten a clear message that tax evasion is wrong from the ordeal of Helmsley s federal trial and her stiff prison sentence.
Alfredo Mendez said it would be in the interest of justice to prosecute Helmsley to the fullest extent of the law.
The judge said he would rule on the dismissal motions May 17.
STOCK SPECIALIST FIRM FINED FOR SECURITIES FRAUD.
A specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange was fined 480 350 for securities fraud by a judge who said he imposed the sentence as a deterrent.
Haight said Thursday at the sentencing of Marcus Schloss Co.
Prosecutors said Marcus Schloss was the first NYSE firm to be convicted of felony charges related to insider trading.
The company was convicted last July of conspiracy to trade on inside information and of securities fraud in connection with its March 1986 purchase of stock in American Brands Inc.
Marcus Schloss could have been fined a maximum of 1 million 500 000 for each of two counts.
Haight however said he considered only a fine of 500 000 because both charges stemmed from the American Brands deal.
From that amount the judge said he subtracted 19 650 which the company previously paid the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil charges stemming from the American Brands trade.
JUDGE DISMISSES 180 TAX COUNTS AGAINST LEONA.
A state judge today dismissed nearly all of a 188 count state tax fraud indictment against hotel queen Leona Helmsley saying the charges constituted double jeopardy because of her federal tax conviction.
Helmsley 70 was not satisfied saying all the criminal charges should have been dismissed by State Supreme Court Justice John Bradley.
she told reporters as she left the courthouse with her legal entourage and headed for a black stretch limousine.
All eight counts are the same offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.
Each has a maximum penalty of four years in prison.
Helmsley has already been sentenced to four years in prison for her federal conviction last summer.
A jury found that she cheated the government out of millions of dollars in taxes by disguising renovations to her Greenwich Conn.
mansion as business expenses of the hotel empire she runs with her husband Harry.
Bradley dismissed 180 counts in the 188 count state indictment nearly all of which stem from activities at Dunnellen Hall the 26 acre estate.
He said a double jeopardy situation was created by the joint state federal investigations in which many of the same witnesses were presented to state and federal grand juries.
The eight counts Bradley left intact concern a condominium in North Hills N.
and the Park Lane Hotel in New York City.
Bradley rejected Helmsley s arguments that all charges should be dropped in "the interest of justice.
Helmsley s federal sentence is stayed pending appeal.
Her lawyer Alan Dershowitz is confident that she will not spend a day in jail.
LISA JONES WAS CONVICTED IN MARCH 1989 OF SEVEN COUNTS OF PERJURY IN FRONT OF A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATING THE BROKERAGE.
Jones a teen age runaway who became a 100 000 a year trading assistant at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
got a reduction Friday in the sentence she received for lying to a grand jury investigating Wall Street fraud.
Sand reduced his original 18 month prison sentence to 10 months after an appeals court threw out the longer term on grounds that it was stiffer than mandated by federal sentencing guidelines.
Sand also fined Jones 25 000 and ordered her to pay 14 850 for the cost of her incarceration.
In addition he required her to receive mental health treatment during her term.
2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the original sentence violated guidelines that govern crimes occurring after January 1987.
Jones 27 was convicted in March 1989 of seven counts of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying in January 1988 to a federal grand jury investigating trading activities at Drexel.
Sand said he was sympathetic to Jones psychological problems and troubled childhood she ran away from home at 14 but said deterrence was necessary because she lied repeatedly to investigators.
Jones behavior was "not a sudden impulse " the judge said.
Jones who worked at Drexel s Beverly Hills junk bond department was the first person convicted in the government s lengthy investigation of fraud on Wall Street.
She was an assistant to Drexel trader Bruce L.
Newberg who was convicted in the Princeton Newport case and sentenced to three months in prison.
Jones sobbed throughout the sentencing and afterward was hugged by three friends including Newberg s wife.
"I don t even know where to begin to try to rebuild my life.
" Jones is to surrender to federal authorities by July 23 to begin her sentence.
She must spend five months at a minimum security prison camp in Phoenix before becoming eligible for transfer to a halfway house in Los Angeles or to home detention.
OFFICIALS PRAISE STIFF TERM IN S L FRAUD CASE.
The sentencing Friday of Janet Faye McKinzie to a 20 year prison term for her role in the collapse of North America Savings Loan brought wide praise from thrift regulators and law enforcement authorities.
McKinzie s sentence which was coupled with an order to repay 14 million swindled from the now defunct Santa Ana thrift is one of the stiffest penalties in the nation for anyone charged with thrift fraud.
She was a consultant to North America but as a close associate of the S L s late owner Duayne D.
Christensen she was the thrift s de facto head regulators had charged.
Davis commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loan.
Davis acted as conservator for the state when it seized the S L after Christensen s death in a car accident.
Black counsel for the Office of Thrift Supervision s district headquarters in San Francisco.
Lawler special agent in charge of the FBI s Los Angeles office.
His seven county district which includes Orange County is continuing to investigate further allegations at North America.
said Douglas Tillett a Justice Department spokesman in Washington.
The order to repay 14 million is an "unknown factor " Davis said.
Her stiff sentence is also part of a nationwide trend that federal authorities are beginning to see in prosecutions of white collar criminals in the savings and loan scandal.
Statistics to support the trend however were not available Friday.
Data provided by the Justice Department however does indicate that the days of the slap on the wrist as punishment for fraud are drawing to a close.
The agency has won convictions of 211 people in major thrift fraud cases since Oct.
Of that total 153 people have been sentenced so far and 78 of them 119 sent to prison Tillett said.
The average jail time is a little more than three years he said.
But he estimated that about half the sentences meted out are three to five year terms and roughly 25 exceed 10 years.
While Black also sees a trend toward heavier sentences of thrift defrauders he said a continuing problem remains courts are inconsistent.
A Los Angeles federal court judge Monday imposed a 15 year prison sentence on David A.
Feldman of Palos Verdes convicted of a massive bank fraud and ordered him to pay 70.
Federal prosecutors said they believed that the restitution award is the largest imposed in a bank fraud case.
It was unclear however whether Feldman has the resources to make restitution.
Tevrizian imposed the stiff sentence on Feldman 50 who was convicted of three counts of felony mail fraud in June.
The judge issued stinging criticism of Feldman who graduated near the top of his class at West Point.
Feldman and two others were indicted in May 1989 in connection with a scheme to sell more than 144 million in mortgage loans to 20 banks and savings and loans all of which operate outside California.
Feldman controlled National Mortgage Equity Corp.
which allegedly made false representations and concealed material facts in selling mortgage backed securities to financial institutions.
Feldman assured financial institutions their investments were protected against defaults in various ways including independent underwriting of borrowers ability to pay and of the value of the real property securing the loans.
However Feldman and his co defendants concealed the fact that there was no independent underwriting because the brokers insurance firms and borrowers all were controlled by the same persons.
Feldman according to court documents diverted millions in investor funds through fictitious borrowers to a bonding firm Glacier General Assurance to enable it to pay off its obligations on prior defaulted loans.
Feldman also used NMEC investors money to purchase apartment complexes in Houston for a firm owned by co defendant Kent B.
Prosecutors charged that Feldman gave Rogers 24 million of investors money for construction loans without placing controls on Rogers use of the funds to refurbish and convert the Texas apartments to condominiums.
Most investors losses were covered by Bank of America which acted as an escrow agent and trustee for all but three of the mortgage pools according to Assistant U.
The bank has sought to recover its losses through civil litigation.
Tevrizian denied Feldman bail pending appeal.
Prosecutors said he will spend the next 60 days at Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles and then be assigned to another prison.
Prosecutors recommended that prison officials keep an especially close watch on Feldman noting that he perpetrated some of his crimes while serving a prison term for an earlier fraud conviction.
The final two defendants in the North America Savings Loan scandal were each sentenced Monday to serve one month in a halfway house and ordered to pay 35 000 in restitution and fines for laundering 1.
Vasquez 53 and Frederick Youngdahl 55 were convicted last month of bank fraud for submitting phony invoices to North America and then returning the money they received minus a 25 000 laundering fee to thrift Chairman Duayne D.
Stotler denied a request by federal prosecutors to imprison the two agreeing with the defense that they were bit players in a fraud that caused the failure of the thrift.
" Youngdahl a Newport Beach engineer declined to comment in court.
North America was seized by regulators in 1987 and its failure is estimated to cost taxpayers 120 million.
The case was described by federal authorities as particularly egregious because the masterminds behind the fraud Christensen and consultant Janet Faye McKinzie spent much of the thrift s money on extravagances like Rolls Royces and lavish parties.
McKinzie was convicted in March on 22 of 26 counts that included racketeering conspiracy bank fraud wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property.
Stotler sentenced McKinzie to 20 years in jail the harshest punishment meted out in California and the second longest nationwide for an insider involved in the nation s savings and loan debacle.
The former real estate agent and high school dropout had pleaded that she was temporarily insane because she was under the influence of prescription drugs as well as Christensen himself whom her attorney characterized as Vasquez and Youngdahl claimed that they too were taken in by Christensen a major client of both men.
Christensen was an unindicted co conspirator in the North America trials.
He died in a mysterious car accident just 9 1 2 hours before regulators seized North America.
Hirsch said his client was still in something of a fog about the transactions that got him into trouble.
Seave told Stotler he didn t believe the defendants stories.
Stotler denied a federal recommendation that the two men pay millions of dollars in restitution saying the 13.
5 million that McKinzie was ordered to return in restitution and fines would cover the money stolen through the money laundering scheme.
Monday s sentencing marked the end of the federal government s criminal prosecution of those involved in the North America fraud.
Altogether seven people were convicted of crimes ranging from racketeering to making false statements.
THE NORTH AMERICA S L SCANDAL North America Savings Loan in Santa Ana was seized by regulators in 1987 and its collapse is expected to cost taxpayers 120 million.
Seven people connected with the S L were convicted including thrift consultant Janet Faye McKinzie.
She received 20 years in jail in July the stiffest sentence ever meted out in California and the second longest nationwide for a S L insider involved in the country s thrift debacle.
Below is a tally of the punishments issued against others involved in North America s failure.
Racketeering conspiracy bank fraud wire fraud interstate transportation of stolen property Sentence.
and two others pleaded guilty Tuesday to siphoning nearly 300 000 from the computer company and agreed to repay the money in lieu of a prison term Costa Mesa police said.
The executive Steven William Hunt 43 of Arcadia and his accomplices John Francis Mazarella 54 of Mission Viejo and Danielle Ann Marie 42 of Laguna Niguel were each sentenced to eight years in prison and three years probation.
They each pleaded guilty to 12 counts of felony grand theft and fraud.
The prison sentences handed down in a Harbor Division courtroom will be delayed pending repayment of the embezzled funds Costa Mesa Police Detective Steven R.
The three were arrested in June after a clerical error revealed that Hunt was falsely steering referral fees to Mazarella and Marie who had set up bogus executive employment agencies.
Under the scheme Hunt scanned applications from newly hired employees in high paying high tech positions Labbitt said.
Hunt separated those who had been referred to Digital Equipment Corp.
by legitimate executive search firms from those who responded to newspaper advertisements or applied on recommendations from other workers Labbitt said.
Hunt forwarded information detailing annual salaries and positions of those employees not referred by head hunting agencies to Mazarella and Marie Labbitt said.
Mazarella an independent consultant hired to screen employees for Digital Equipment and Marie who was not connected to the company set up a phony employment agency and used the information supplied by Hunt to bill Digital.
Each invoice typically requested 15 of the new employee s annual salary which ranged from 50 000 to 80 000 Labbitt said.
The suspects allegedly collected fees totaling nearly 300 000 between 1986 and 1989 by claiming that they had referred 30 new employees to Digital.
The amount of restitution to the company will be determined at a hearing next month Labbitt said.
SHE SAYS THE TERM IS INTENDED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THE EX JUNK BOND KING.
SHE IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS COMMITTED ADDITIONAL SERIOUS CRIMES.
A federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in prison Wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither minor nor isolated.
The sentence was by far the harshest imposed in the recent chain of Wall Street scandals.
Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term is meant to make an example of the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king whose innovative use of high yield high risk bonds had fueled the corporate takeover frenzy of the 1980s.
Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony securities law violations last April.
But in a jammed courtroom in Manhattan s federal courthouse Wood said that Milken 44 who has been accused among other things of helping to bring on the national savings and loan disaster could not be blamed for all of the financial excesses of the 1980s.
Wood said she had not made him a scapegoat for "the decade of greed.
" The judge said she based the sentence only on evidence of specific crimes presented in court.
Milken family members supporters and lawyers were plainly shocked by the sentence.
Liman left the courthouse without commenting and did not return phone calls later.
Milken s sentence also included three years probation during which he must perform full time community service.
The judge left open the possibility of reducing the sentence if Milken cooperates with the government.
But a number of lawyers who had followed the case closely predicted that he would get no more than five.
A Milken spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether to appeal the sentence.
During his own lawyer s presentation before sentence was imposed Milken at times was in tears in the courtroom.
But when the judge read the sentence he stood rigid and motionless with what appeared to be a look of disbelief when she announced the 10 year term.
Wood also sentenced him to three years of community service while on probation after his prison sentence.
Milken and his wife Lori did not comment to reporters and were permitted to leave the courthouse through a back exit.
Under his plea agreement Milken was already committed to pay 600 million in fines and penalties.
Lawyers said he must turn over that amount before the end of the year.
Because of his huge earnings at Drexel however his wealth is expected to be at least hundreds of millions of dollars.
Wood said evidence presented during a pre sentencing hearing in October convinced her that Milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in April.
Among them she said were several acts of obstruction of justice relating to orders or suggestions to employees to destroy documents.
The judge also rejected longstanding defense claims that Milken s crimes were aberrations by a generally law abiding man and that they were the result of overzealousness to help clients rather than greed.
At Liman s request the judge agreed to sentence Milken under a provision of federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the federal parole commission.
Although Milken technically could be paroled almost immediately government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners to serve close to two thirds of their sentence.
The sentence exceeds all others imposed in the series of securities fraud cases that grew out of the insider trading case against investment banker Dennis B.
Boesky implicated in insider trading on an even grander scale got only three years.
Siegel who directly stole information from his own corporate clients and also received suitcases stuffed with cash from Boesky was let off with only two months.
But in those cases the defendants had fully cooperated with the government before their sentencing turning in prominent former business associates.
Under the highly unusual terms of his plea agreement he is obliged to begin cooperating only now that the sentence has been imposed.
The judge said she would consider reducing the sentence if prosecutors eventually certify to her that Milken has cooperated fully.
Several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the judge to ensure that Milken cooperates fully revealing whatever incriminating information he knows about corporate raiders junk bond buyers and former co workers.
Charles Carberry a lawyer who once headed the U.
attorney s securities fraud unit in New York said.
Coffee a Columbia University law professor said the judge may also have imposed the severe sentence because Milken occupied a position of trust at the center of the financial world.
The six counts that Milken pleaded guilty to included conspiracy securities fraud causing the filing of false information with the Securities and Exchange Commission mail fraud and aiding in the filing of a false tax return.
The sentencing capped the most massive securities fraud investigation ever carried out by the government.
Milken who joined Drexel while still in business school in 1969 plucked junk bonds from obscurity and almost single handedly built what at its peak became a 200 billion market.
From Drexel s junk bond headquarters in Beverly Hills Milken orchestrated transactions that made possible huge leveraged buyouts of such companies as Storer Communications and Beatrice Cos.
But as investigators closed in Milken was forced to resign from Drexel in 1989 after he was named in a 99 count racketeering indictment and the firm itself pleaded guilty to six felony counts.
Months later the junk bond market started to collapse.
And in February Drexel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings.
In addition to total compensation of more than 1 billion from 1984 to 1988 Milken is believed to have received hundreds of millions of dollars from private partnerships he set up to benefit himself family members and employees.
Milken s lawyers however said that Milken s lifestyle was relatively modest and unmaterialistic.
They noted that he had given much of his earnings to charities and that he long had personally worked for them such as by teaching math to abused and abandoned inner city children.
Liman called Milken Liman also argued that Milken is The judge did not dispute that Milken had donated much to worthy causes nor that his charitable activities began well before the investigation of him started in 1986.
But she said that was not enough to make up for his crimes.
During the sentencing Wood disclosed for the first time her findings on the unusual pre sentencing hearings she presided over in October.
The so called Fatico hearings were held to determine if there were evidence of additional crimes beyond the six to which he pleaded guilty.
Under federal court rulings Wood is allowed to consider evidence of other crimes in deciding on a sentence.
In a lengthy written opinion released Wednesday Wood found that Assistant U.
Attorneys John Carroll and Jess Fardella had failed to prove some of their main claims.
She said there was insufficient evidence to prove that Milken was behind a manipulation of WickesCos.
She said the government also did not prove its claim that Milken was guilty of insider trading in Caesars World securities in 1983 and also failed to show that he had illegally made lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds.
But she found that Milken had obstructed justice in part by arranging the destruction of a blue ledger book that showed illegal transactions between Drexel and David Solomon head of Solomon Asset Management.
The judge said Milken also had made remarks to employees in the Beverly Hills office in November 1986 which could only be interpreted as instructions to destroy documents.
Wood also found that Milken had acted improperly by not disclosing to the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co.
that he had kept extremely valuable warrants in a KKR deal for himself and his family instead of selling them to customers.
During the sentencing Wood derided defense claims that Milken was basically law abiding and that if he were not he would have committed more blatant crimes such as insider trading.
She said that an equally likely explanation was that Milken was simply afraid to do anything too blatant.
Wood s sentence was viewed as a rebuff to many prominent Southern Californians who had written to her urging that Milken s sentence be limited to community service.
Among those who had proposed that Milken was suitable for such service was Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F.
Gates who suggested that Milken work for the Police Department s DARE program created to help inner city children.
In court Liman had proposed that the judge accept Gates suggestion.
James Slade a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons said that under Justice Department rules the 10 year term makes it unlikely that Milken will be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum security federal prison camp.
Such camps where Boesky and others caught up in the Wall Street scandals served their sentences have open rooms instead of cells and offer extensive recreation facilities.
Instead Slade said Milken probably will be sent to a medium security prison where there will be a higher concentration of street criminals and fewer white collar offenders.
He said that in some medium security prisons inmates are locked in old fashioned barred cells at night.
Staff writer Paul Richter in New York contributed to this story.
FALL OF THE JUNK BOND KING Here is a chronology of key developments in the prosecution of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
high yield bond chief Michael Milken.
Boesky agrees topays 100 million to settle charges of insider trading cooperate with investigators and plead guilty to a single criminal count.

A federal grand jury indicts Milken his brother Lowell and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud based on information fromBoesky.
The Milkens plead not guilty Newberg does the same later.
Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the government s civil fraud case against the firm that subjects Drexel to federal monitoring for three years and forces it to sever ties with Milken.
Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his own consulting firm.
Lowell Milken quits to return to practice law.
Drexel formally pleads guilty and begins paying its fine.
Drexel s parent company Drexel Burnham Lambert Group files for bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on debts and begins laying off employees.

Milken agrees to settle his case and reaches a plea bargain with the government.
Milken tearfully pleads guilty to six felonies agrees to pay 600 million in restitution and fines and agrees to cooperate with the government after sentencing.
Special two week hearing to consider the government s array of charges against Milken ordered by U.
District Judge Kimba Wood to gain greater insight into Milken s character in order to fashion a fair sentence for the six counts he admitted.
Milken is sentenced to 10 years in jail plus three years probation plus 1 800 hours of community service.
The sentence could be reduced if Milken cooperates with the government in ongoing and future investigations.
JUDGE ASKS LAWYERS TO TOTAL FRAUD LOSSES IN MILKEN CASE.
A federal judge Wednesday asked lawyers for the government and Michael Milken to calculate the total amount of fraud in Milken s crimes to help authorities determine how much prison time he must serve.
Federal parole officials need an estimate to recommend when Milken will be eligible for parole and the number could affect the length of incarceration by more than two years.
Wood last week sentenced the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
financier to 10 years in prison for six felony counts related to illegal securities trading.
At a hearing in Manhattan federal court Wednesday Wood said that because of the nature of Milken s crimes it was not easy to calculate losses to victims.
She said the parole commission While the parole commission makes its own calculation on such losses Wood said she wants to present officials with a number agreeable to both sides.
Under parole guidelines a first offender such as Milken would face a minimum prison term of 24 months to 36 months if victims losses ranged from 200 000 to 1 million.
If the fraud exceeds 1 million Milken s recommended prison term before parole would equal 40 months to 52 months.
Liman said at the hearing that he believed the amount would not exceed 1 million.
As part of his plea deal Milken agreed to pay 200 million in criminal fines and penalties and place 400 million into a fund to compensate investors hurt by his crimes.
Milken s lawyers have 10 days from the date the sentence judgment was entered formally in U.
Court officials said the sentence judgment was to occur Wednesday after Wood allocated 1.
5 million as a criminal fine and the remainder of the 200 million as a penalty completing details of the sentencing.
Liman declined to comment on a published report Wednesday that he planned to appeal the sentence.
CALIFORNIA ANCHOR GROUP S EX PRESIDENT HAD ASKED TO SERVE 1 WEEK A MONTH IN JAIL FOR 10 YEARS.
The former president of a Woodland Hills real estate investment company that defrauded more than 200 investors out of an estimated 12 million was sentenced Thursday in federal court to six years in prison.
District Judge William Matthew Byrne rejected an unusual request from Keranen that he receive a 10 year sentence during which he would be jailed one week of every month and be free the rest of the time to work to pay back the investors.
Byrne rejected the proposal saying the fraud was too serious not to merit a standard prison sentence.
Dymant also opposed Keranen s proposal and had asked Byrne to sentence the once flamboyant salesman to 10 years in prison.
In sentencing Keranen to six years Byrne also ordered him to make restitution of 3.
Keranen who used to live in Woodland Hills but now resides in Oregon was charged in June with taking nearly 4 million in cash and real estate from California Anchor Group after fraudulently enticing investors with claims of 25 yearly returns on their investments.
The company was supposed to build and sell San Fernando Valley apartment complexes but prosecutors said only about 3 of the investors money went into such developments.
Keranen later pleaded guilty to two counts of bank fraud and two counts of mail fraud.
"I committed the crimes " Keranen said tearfully during his sentencing hearing.
" Robert Dumas and Ronald Stoliar California Anchor vice presidents pleaded guilty to lesser charges.
Stoliar was placed on five years probation by Byrne.
Dumas who was scheduled to be sentenced Thursday did not appear and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.
Keranen has filed for bankruptcy and his attorney said he had about 100 000 available for restitution.
A handful of California Anchor investors watched the sentencing and left with little hope of ever getting much of their money back.
said Terry Thomason a Canoga Park investor who said his family lost 250 000 in the scam.
