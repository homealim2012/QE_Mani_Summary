For more than a decade drug enforcement officials had stalked the man they called "the godfather" of Mexican cocaine trafficking but Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo routinely eluded them through a network of secret ranches and urban safehouses hidden telephone lines and police protection.
Just last month what were intended as surprise raids on three of the reputed drug lord s houses in Guadalajara came an hour too late and ended in another failure for U.
Drug Enforcement Administration had to pull its own agents out of Guadalajara for several days to ensure their safety.
In their absence or perhaps because of it Felix Gallardo grew complacent.
He remained in one house for three days unaware that Mexican police officers posing as newlyweds had rented an apartment across the street.
The capture of Felix Gallardo last Saturday seems an unquestionable success.
and Mexican officials charge that he ran a multibillion dollar drug ring employing about 3 000 people including police and politicians.
He owned hotels a small fleet of aircraft and 250 houses and ranches in several states.
But his dramatic arrest highlights a new and more disturbing dynamic in the decades long fight against illegal cocaine smuggling into the United States.
Overcoming repeated assaults on their production and determined efforts to block their traditional transportation routes the drug kingpins of South America have blazed new trails through Mexico Central America and their own continent that make the international drug war in some ways more daunting than ever.
interdiction program throughout the Caribbean in recent years has increasingly shifted traffickers away from their usual routes to south Florida and made this country a growing transshipment point for South American cocaine headed for the United States.
Although no coca is grown in Mexico an inhospitable climate for the highland plant whose dried leaves are the source of cocaine Mexican officials now estimate that 15 of the refined cocaine consumed in the United States passes through here.
officials put the estimate far higher saying that as much a third of the U.
bound cocaine may now come through America s southern neighbor.
Regardless of which figure is accurate now a scant four years ago the total was only 1 or 2.
said Hernan Vargas a narcotics officer with Costa Rica s judicial police force.
So many are those options in fact that enforcement officials fear a crackdown in Mexico could simply push the traffickers deeper into Central America or as it has in the past draw Colombians north in their place.
The last major assault on Mexican drug organizations came in 1985 after the kidnaping and torture death of Guadalajara based DEA agent Enrique S.
Drug lords Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo were jailed and Felix Gallardo suspected of ordering the killing went into hiding.
No Longer Off Limits The arrests opened the way for Colombian traffickers to move into territory previously off limits to them.
Until then the Mexican drug organizations had jealously controlled the Mexico leg of the cocaine journey insisting on picking up the narcotics in South America and delivering them to Americans at the U.
But now Colombian traffickers who dominate the world cocaine market have begun cutting out Mexican middlemen and hauling the refined white powder themselves in Colombian planes with Colombian pilots.
In many cases the traffickers make pit stops in Central America.
They refuel or change airplanes at isolated airstrips in the coastal lowlands of Belize western Costa Rica southern Guatemala and northern Honduras.
Then they take off again for Mexico where they aim to land as close as possible to the U.
4 Tons Shipped Each Month Although Felix Gallardo denies all charges against him officials say he trafficked for Pablo Escobar a kingpin of Colombia s Medellin cartel and one of the world s richest cocaine traders.
They say Felix Gallardo shipped an estimated four tons of cocaine across the U.
Mexico border each month controlling supplies to the West Coast.
Even traffickers who did not work for him reportedly had to seek his permission to operate along the border with California and Arizona.
said a drug enforcement official who like many of those interviewed declined to be identified for security reasons.
Felix Gallardo held on to shipping to the West Coast of the United States including the lucrative Southern California market but the Colombians have taken over shipping to the Midwest and East Coast and now control two thirds of the cocaine traffic through Mexico.
At least 158 Colombians have been arrested in Mexico on drug charges over the last six years Mexican officials say.
They admit concern about the Colombian infiltration into their country noting the extent to which drug cartels have subverted national institutions in Colombia in particular the justice system.
Officials hesitate to speculate on the long term effect of the Felix Gallardo arrest on cocaine supplies in the United States but Ed Heath DEA chief for Mexico told reporters that it would have "a significant impact" on the market.
Privately however drug officials wonder how long that will last.
according to one source who added that still the biggest most lucrative cocaine market in the world.
Cocaine seizures in Mexico have increased steadily from about five metric tons in 1986 to 15 metric tons last year.
and Mexican officials consider the increase to be a barometer indicating how much more cocaine is getting through.
said Javier Coello Trejo Mexico s deputy attorney general in charge of narcotics investigations.
One Cache Was Almost 5 Tons he added.
6 metric tons of cocaine officials in Washington said.
1 tons were intercepted near the Mexican border with the rest being stopped elsewhere in the South.
Several of the seizures along the Mexican border were sizable.
Agents found 895 kilos on an 18 wheeler tractor trailer crossing the border at McAllen Tex.
Another 1 232 kilos were found on a tractor trailer at McAllen.
Authorities found 857 kilos on vehicles crossing at El Paso.
Much of Mexico s new prominence as a "trampoline" to the United States is due to the U.
officials cocaine shipments moved relatively freely through south Florida until the mid 1980s.
said John McGee assistant special agent in charge of U.
Customs officials responded in 1981 and 1982 with two executive jets fitted with sophisticated radar and a radar blimp called "Fat Albert" near Key West.
Officials later launched a second blimp at Cape Canaveral Fla.
Under pressure in Florida airspace the traffickers changed routes between 1983 and 1984 flying to airstrips in the Bahamas where they moved their cargo to high speed boats.
They particularly liked Bimini 49 miles off Florida and Norman s Cay where Medellin drug lord Carlos Lehder reportedly had established a refueling station for traffickers.
The break in the Caribbean came in 1986 after authorities had further tightened their radar net.
When charges of corruption reached as high as Prime Minister Lynden Pindling the Bahamian government bowed to U.
pressure and agreed to an extraordinary surrender of sovereignty that permits U.
Customs DEA and Coast Guard aircraft and vessels to use the islands as a base to pursue traffickers.
Since then the United States has launched a third blimp on Grand Bahama Island and plans to put a fourth in operation this fall at Georgetown Great Exuma.
Two more one in Puerto Rico and another on Great Inagua Island will complete the radar fence.
The surveillance net forced traffickers to adopt another series of changes.
Some planes moved to more remote islands where the cocaine was transferred to long range cabin cruisers.
Haiti with its extremely impoverished population and ineffective police force has become a preferred landing spot.
A few planes fly around the western tip of Cuba and land on the Florida Gulf Coast.
Airdropping Loads of Drugs In addition traffickers have revived a marijuana smugglers trick of airdropping loads of drugs to mother ships at sea DEA special agent Jack Hook said in Miami.
He said the traffickers fly across central Cuba drop the cocaine to a ship at a rendezvous point and fly nonstop back to Colombia.
It is not known whether the drug flights have official Cuban approval but Hook contended that Cuban officials must know about them because so many planes fly across the waist of their country.
At the same time smugglers also switched to cargo ships.
Cocaine stashes have been found in shipments of hollowed out pineapples cut flowers frozen fish and other perishables which are prime vehicles because they must be cleared quickly through customs to avoid spoilage.
Sesame Seeds Auto Parts McGee said.
Among the most clever ruses Hook recalled was pure liquefied cocaine contained in clear plastic bags tucked inside water filled plastic sacks of live tropical fish.
From the outside all that could be seen was fish and water.
To date the biggest cocaine hauls from cargo boats were two shipments hidden among pallets of Brazilian cedar boards.
Dozens of the 12 foot by 4 inch planks had been hollowed out stuffed with cocaine and then meticulously sealed so they looked as solid as the other boards.
One batch seized by the DEA at Port Everglades Fla.
But even as they used greater ingenuity in the Caribbean the smugglers shifted much of their traffic westward.
DEA officials believe Guatemala is now the favored transshipment point in Central America followed by Honduras and Costa Rica.
El Salvador s uses are limited by civil war and a lack of extensive lowlands.
Officials have little information on Nicaragua but believe the war has limited its role too.
Tiny Belize meanwhile has begun handling more and more cocaine traffic as its marijuana fortunes have dropped.
The largest cocaine seizure in Central America to date occurred in Puerto Barrios Guatemala in 1987.
Three Turbo Commander 1000 airplanes from Colombia made drops of 800 kilos each on a jungle strip several miles inland.
From there the 2 400 kilo shipment was taken to port on a banana train and loaded onto a Miami bound container ship with Panamanian registry.
Guatemalan officials seized 850 kilos in all of 1988 and one 349 kilo shipment so far this year.
Former Interior Minister Juan Jose Rodil said his country offers "ideal conditions" as a staging area for traffickers.
High Level Corruption Indeed high level corruption is a problem throughout Central America.
grand juries indicted Panamanian strongman Manuel A.
officials have long charged that his country is a center for laundering drug money.
officials accused the Honduran military chief Gen.
Humberto Regalado Hernandez of allowing Colombian traffickers to transship through Honduras for pay.
Also last year however Honduran authorities arrested Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros a major drug figure working for the Medellin cartel and turned him over to U.
In Guatemala some authorities suspect former Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo of ties to trafficking.
In a case that broke last July officials seized Erico Alfonso Ralda Batres as he claimed 54 pounds of cocaine in suitcases at Aurora International Airport.
Waiting for Ralda in a jeep outside the terminal building was Carlos Cabrera brother of the former foreign minister.
The incident led to a flurry of newspaper speculation that Cabrera Hidalgo now a Christian Democratic Party candidate for president was involved in trafficking.
Although traffickers like to stop over in Central America they can fly directly from South America to Mexico with extra fuel but the trade off is that the more fuel they carry the less room they have for cocaine.
Many planes that once flew to the Bahamas now land on Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula and unload onto trucks.
More commonly Mexican officials say the planes fly nonstop from Colombia up the Pacific and Gulf coasts of Mexico then cut inland to isolated landing strips in the states of Chihuahua Nuevo Leon Sonora Sinaloa and Baja California.
To avoid detection the drug planes usually stay low and about 10 miles offshore.
Some escape notice through a daring technique called "mating " where two aircraft fly in formation as close together as possible to show only a single blip on radar screens.
Just before the planes reach their destination they peel apart.
One follows a legitimate flight plan and lands legally while the other dumps the cocaine elsewhere and takes off again.
The smugglers favor Turbo Commander 1000s or Cessna 206s which can fly nonstop from Colombia with an extra fuel tank and can land with little damage to the aircraft on the innumerable short dirt airstrips that dot the Mexican countryside.
Tactics and technology are only partly responsible for the traffickers success however.
Large scale cocaine shippers Mexican or Colombian could not operate in Mexico without some kind of official protection to get their planes in and out of Mexico or their trucks across the country.
Enrique Alvarez del Castillo made his government s first public acknowledgement of official complicity in drug trafficking this week when he announced that six law enforcement authorities were arrested for having supplied Felix Gallardo with weapons radio equipment and information on drug investigations.
The high level arrests were unusual and they included one of the attorney general s own deputies Gregorio Enrique Corza Marin who not only headed drug investigations for Sinaloa state but also was a relative of the wife of Coello Trejo the deputy attorney general.
Also arrested were the city police commander in Culiacan the capital of Sinaloa the Sinaloa state Judicial Police commander and three Federal Highway Police commanders.
After the arrests officials reported droves of desertions from the police forces of Guadalajara Culiacan and Mazatlan cities where Felix Gallardo maintained operations bases.
officials say the arrests send a signal to other traffickers and police officials that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari "means business.
" Salinas has called the war on drugs a national priority and raised the budget for drug enforcement by 174 over last year to 53 million.
His administration also is installing a 50 million radar system in the Gulf of Tehuantepec with the capacity to detect low flying aircraft 30 miles out to sea.
The Mexican air force will be employed to chase down the craft.
In addition to Felix Gallardo authorities have arrested two mid level traffickers this year.
Gilbert Ontiveros Lucero one of the most notorious smugglers along the U.
Mexico border was jailed in Chihuahua state after officials seized eight tons of marijuana believed to be his.
Soon after police jailed Giuseppe Catani Ponsiglione a one time heroin smuggler convicted in the United States years ago as part of the "French Connection" heroin smuggling operation.
Police seized 650 kilos of cocaine from an airplane that arrived in Chihuahua from Bogota and believed Catani was behind the deal.
They recall a history of other cases that have not gone as well such as the Mexican army s discovery of 4.
8 metric tons of cocaine in a cave in Chihuahua state last year the largest cocaine seizure in Mexican history.
officials believe the haul was really 8 tons on 17 flights from Colombia and that the army let 3 tons go through.
No one was arrested no plane was seized and at the time the government played down a bust it should have been proud to flaunt they say.
sources suspect the former Mexico defense minister Gen.
Juan Arevalo Gardoqui of complicity in this and other drug deals.
Arevalo who reportedly is living in a costly home in Chihuahua state is one of several officials that the Salinas administration has quietly retired.
officials initially were stunned by Salinas appointment as attorney general of Alvarez del Castillo a former governor of Jalisco state who apparently ignored flourishing drug trafficking there.
But his deputy Coello Trejo is well regarded among both U.
and Mexican law enforcement officials who gave him the title "iron prosecutor" when he last served in the attorney general s office from 1971 to 1982.
The 40 year old lawyer is seen as a man with a mandate from President Salinas and Coello Trejo vows to use his power to make more arrests.
With the removal of Felix Gallardo he said Times staff writers Don A.
Schanche in Miami Richard Boudreaux in Managua and Ronald J.
Ostrow and Douglas Jehl both in Washington contributed to this story.
Operation Pisces the federal Drug Enforcement Administration s huge two year undercover effort was an intelligence coup that revealed the inner workings of the drug trade from Colombia to the United States.
When the case ended in 1987 officials had arrested 220 drug dealers and seized 28 million in cash and assets and more than 11 000 pounds of cocaine in Southern California.
Here is an illustration of the flow of drugs and money between Colombia and Los Angeles and some of the main players.
JUAN SANCHEZ PEREZ Colombian drug dealer.
Arrested with 10 other Colombians at one of three Orange County stash houses April 4 1986.
JORGE RESTREPO Colombian drug dealer money launderer.
Arrested near LAX with 65 pounds of coke on March 24 1987.
1 660 additional pounds seized at a stash house in Rowland Heights.
LEOPOLDO PILOTO Cuban drug dealer worked for Jesus Zapata.
Arrested at Piloto s stash house in Sylmar on Dec.
HUGO OBANDO CHOA Former M 19 guerrilla in Colombia.
Key lieutenant in charge of smuggling and distributing thousands of pounds of cocaine per month to operatives in Los Angeles.
Key lieutenant in charge of laundering 17 million a week in drug profits from Los Angeles to banks in Panama and Miami where cash is converted to Colombian pesos.
Arrested in May 1987 at Miami International Airport after officials expelled him from Panama and forced him on a plane to Florida.
PABLO ESCOBAR Controls the major drug cartel out of Medellin Colombia.
Oversees 20 to 30 top lieutenants who ship cocaine into the United States through Mexico to Los Angeles and into Miami by sea and air laundering profits back to Colombia through banks in Panama and Miami.
Jose Abrantes has been fired for "great deficiency" in this Communist nation s first drug trafficking scandal the official newspaper Granma said today.
It said in a front page announcement signed by President Fidel Castro that the Communist Party Politburo decided to name Gen.
Abelardo Colome Ibarra as new interior minister a job diplomats say ranks third in Cuba s power structure.
Abrantes a well known figure and long time associate of Castro and his younger brother Raul became the first high level government casualty in the scandal involving top Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez a hero of the Cuban revolution.
Granma said the Politburo decided to fire Abrantes in view Ochoa and six accomplices including Interior Ministry Col.
Antonio de la Guardia Font have been charged with helping Colombia s Medellin drug cartel to smuggle six tons of cocaine into the United States between 1987 and this year through military air bases in Cuba.
A military court of honor earlier this week recommended that Ochoa be court martialed for high treason with all its 47 members saying he was a traitor and deserved death by firing squad.
CUBA FIRES CABINET OFFICER AS DRUG PURGE CONTINUES.
Cuba s interior minister the Cabinet officer in charge of domestic law enforcement was fired Thursday as that nation s drug purge continued but the crackdown has failed to touch other leaders who U.
Jose Abrantes was replaced to allow an investigation to proceed into how a group of officers a communique issued in Havana said.
The firing came two days after a special military tribunal recommended a court martial and death penalty for Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez who confessed to smuggling drugs ivory and diamonds.
indictment alleging that he assisted convicted marijuana and methaqualone smugglers.
There are other issues that also call the Cuban crackdown into question according to U.
financier Robert Vesco on the island accusations that Cuban leader Fidel Castro mediated on behalf of the Medellin cocaine cartel of Colombia and continued reports of smuggling operations being carried out through Cuba.
Selective Crackdown The selectivity of the Cuban crackdown has led experts here to suggest that there were two drug smuggling operations in Cuba.
said Jaime Suchlicki head of the Institute for American Studies at the University of Miami and author of a new book on the Cuban military.
It is impossible for military backed drug smuggling operations to continue without the Castro brothers knowledge he asserted.
As recently as Sunday a plane carrying a ton of cocaine passed over Cuba and dropped its load in the Bahamas according to federal officials here.
patrols observed the Cuban navy in Cuban waters said Coast Guard Lt.
UNLIKE THEIR MEDELLIN BRETHREN THEY SHUN OPEN VIOLENCE.
Ciudad Jardin Cali s most exclusive suburb boasts a dazzling array of walled mansions on hillsides entwined with curving streets and blooming with satellite dishes.
This is the neighborhood of choice for the dons of the Cali cartel Colombia s gentlemen cocaine traffickers.
Like the more savage and notorious Medellin cartel the Cali traffickers use Colombia as a base for smuggling huge amounts of cocaine into the United States.
But the Cali cartel prefers whenever possible to avoid the open violence including assassinations of high officials that has focused world attention on the Medellin gangsters.
The Cali traffickers try to blend peacefully with the wealthy elite in this clean and prosperous city of 1.
5 million people seeking respect and security through investments and carefully cultivated contacts.
Strong Influence said a Roman Catholic priest in Cali.
When murder is required to assert their illicit power the Cali dons also try to use discretion said Col.
Jose Pelaez chief of Colombia s judicial police.
Thus the Cali based cocaine trade has thrived in relative obscurity drawing less attention than the Medellin cartel from both news media and law enforcement officials.
Perhaps the most famous residents of Ciudad Jardin are brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.
The two grew up in a poor section of Cali far from the luxury of Ciudad Jardin.
As youths they took low paying jobs as drugstore clerks.
Miguel earned a law degree from Cali s prestigious San Buenaventura University which is run by Franciscan priests.
At one point Gilberto allegedly tried his hand at kidnaping a lucrative industry in Colombia.
Through the years the brothers built up an impressive business empire including a national chain of discount drugstores a pharmaceutical laboratory a radio network a bank a Chrysler Corp.
agency a bus fleet a professional soccer team and ranches and other real estate.
Anti drug officials say there is no doubt that much of the Rodriguez Orejuelas investment capital has come from cocaine and that millions of dollars in trafficking profits have been laundered through their other businesses.
Gilberto s reputation as an astute strategist has earned him a nickname.
Heavy jowled and well dressed at 50 his looks fit the role of successful business executive.
He enjoys local popularity as vice president of Club America the soccer team controlled by the brothers.
People in Cali hear and read about the cocaine cartel but many tend to overlook its sinister implications.
A senior partner in the Rodriguez Orejuelas organization is Jose Santacruz Londono 45.
He has invested heavily in Cali real estate and construction projects and currently is said to be the main financier behind a large shopping center being built on a prime Cali site once occupied by Sears Roebuck Co.
Called Don Chepe Santacruz Londono is nearly 6 feet tall and weighs more than 250 pounds.
According to local lore he once tried to join Cali s exclusive Club Colombia but was blackballed so he built a mansion in Ciudad Jardin that resembles the club building.
Another leading member of the loosely linked Cali Cartel is Francisco Herrera.
A young man known as Don Pacho Herrera is the son of Benjamin Herrera Zuleta a pioneer trafficker who began moving cocaine in the early 1970s.
The father nicknamed the Black Pope was convicted this year on drug trafficking charges in Las Vegas.
Several anti drug officials admitted in interviews that they have little information about other major cartel figures.
lamented a DEA investigator adding that investigative manpower and resources cannot keep up with the cartel s burgeoning activities.
Before Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela was well known DEA agents documented a cocaine trafficking trip he made in 1981 to Los Angeles where he was later indicted in federal court.
He also has been indicted on drug trafficking charges in New York Miami and New Orleans.
He was arrested in Spain in November 1984 using a false Venezuelan passport.
Also arrested was his traveling companion Jorge Luis Ochoa a leader of the Medellin cartel.
The United States tried to extradite both Rodriguez Orejuela and Ochoa but competing extradition requests from Colombia were honored by the Spanish judge who heard the case.
Allegations that the judge took a bribe later sparked a scandal in Spain.
Ochoa was released without trial in Colombia causing another scandal but Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela was tried on his home turf Cali along with Santacruz Londono.
Fernando Navas who served as prosecutor late in that case said the charges against Rodriguez Orejuela were hastily concocted to keep him from being extradited by the United States.
He said he believes that bribes were paid in the case but he added that he had no proof.
The trial judge refused to consider evidence submitted by the DEA from cases in New York and Los Angeles.
Rodriguez Orejuela and Santacruz Londono were acquitted and the Colombian Supreme Court is now considering a government appeal in the Rodriguez Orejuela case.
Except for the appeal Rodriguez Orejuela is free of charges in Colombia as is Santacruz Londono.
Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela and other major members of the Cali cartel have never been charged with trafficking here.
They circulate freely in Cali and police leave them alone.
Colombia has invalidated a 1979 extradition treaty with the United States so cartel leaders are currently not threatened by U.
When they move around their city they do so under heavy security because of a blood feud with the Medellin cartel.
A year and a half of the so called War of the Cartels has cost dozens of lives on both sides.
According to a police tally the Medellin cartel has dynamited 47 drugstores in the Drogas La Rebaja chain owned by the Rodriguez Orejuelas.
Six radio stations in the Grupo Radial Colombiano network have been bombed.
A friend of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela said the family has sold the radio network to broadcast evangelists for 9 million but cannot find a buyer for the drugstores.
Investigators and analysts have different theories on the cause of the war between the two cartels which used to cooperate.
Some say it is a fight over cocaine markets in the United States.
Others say it has grown from successive betrayals members of one cartel informing to law enforcement officials against the other.
But most observers agree that it is a power struggle between two greedy groups that are natural rivals in the same immensely profitable business.
Most of the casualties have been low ranking cartel soldiers and little of the violence has taken place in Cali where the hometown traffickers have a tight security system with hundreds of bodyguards.
But in February Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela s chief of security was shot to death on a downtown Cali street.
And so the mannerly camouflage of the Cali cartel is coming unraveled.
In Ciudad Jardin Spanish for Garden City there is a disturbing new reminder of the cartel s sinister presence.
the crumbling ruins of a large corner house destroyed by a mysterious bomb several weeks ago.
EX DRUG DEALERS TELL OF MIAMI TO L.
A yearlong campaign by West Coast law enforcement officials to spotlight a shift in drug trafficking from Miami to Los Angeles and plead for more federal assistance took a turn toward the theatrical Tuesday with testimony by two former distributors.
Wearing bright red ski masks the two men both now police informers were marched behind a white screen to tell a state panel how some Colombian cocaine importers began bypassing Miami.
said a Florida informer called "Tony Jones " his voice altered by an electronic device to sound somewhat like Darth Vader s.
Hearing The two men were witnesses at a hearing at a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport before the Attorney General s Commission on Narcotics a group of law enforcement officials from around the state.
It was a message that Van de Kamp and others have voiced repeatedly this year and with increasing frequency in anticipation of the Bush Administration s anti drug program.
In January federal and local drug agents announced that they had seized more than 100 million in cash from drug dealers in Los Angeles in 1988 more than in Miami.
Federal Drug Enforcement Administration officials concluded that while Miami remained the major import point for the cocaine about 40 of the drug entering the country was being shipped to Southern California.
In April top officials of the Los Angeles offices of several federal law enforcement agencies joined the Board of Supervisors complaining that there was an Eastern bias in allocation of federal drug fighting resources.
They called for an infusion of federal funds and manpower similar to the one in 1982 that led to the creation of a South Florida task force.
Dick Thornburgh said Los Angeles street gangs have formed alliances with the Colombian drug cartels and are selling "crack" cocaine in every corner of the nation.
Just two weeks ago Van de Kamp announced that he will seek 13 million from the Legislature to hire more than 200 new state drug agents analysts and auditors effective Jan.
Van de Kamp who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor has also proposed construction of an 8 000 bed prison camp in the desert for drug offenders and creation of a state "anti drug superfund" to distribute 1.
7 billion over eight years to local law police and governments.
Pete Wilson considered the front runner to be the GOP candidate in the 1990 gubernatorial race has called for a 4 billion federal bond program to fund the Bush anti drug program which will be unveiled in September by drug czar William J.
Van de Kamp said Tuesday that he has seen a draft of the plan and expects California to get from 60 to 80 million which he called The day s hearing was designed in part he said.
"Tony " the Florida informant brought to the tightly guarded hearing described himself as an expert in technical details of transporting drugs knowing the optimum weight of airplane shipments depending on the distance flown for instance or the safest overland routes from Miami to Seattle.
He said bribes to Colombian officials were an accepted cost of doing business explaining The cartel kingpins have sitting around he said and in one case The second informant testifying from behind the screen identified as "John Smith " said he distributed about 10 kilograms of cocaine a week after getting it from Colombians in Los Angeles who brought it through Mexico.
Asked why he stopped he said "I was arrested.
" While California officials appealed for more federal assistance two law enforcement representatives from Miami cautioned them that the federal presence there created problems as well.
Lewis Wilson who oversees the Miami office of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said federal agents arrived who were and were of little use for two years.
In addition interagency rivalry with investigators from different groups often reluctant to share information.
Wilson said he doesn t believe there has been a relocation of cocaine traffickers from Miami to Los Angeles but simply GUATEMALA SEEN SLIPPING INTO A HAVEN FOR DRUGS.
1 a car carrying two men and a large green canvas suitcase was waved through security checkpoints directly onto the tarmac of La Aurora airport where a commercial jet was being loaded for a flight to Miami.
The men worked for the chief of Guatemala s anti corruption office but the suitcase contained 55 pounds of cocaine.
Acting with the assurance that comes naturally to high level government officials the men ordered the baggage crew to load the suitcase onto the plane.
However a nearby airline official alerted members of an American trained anti drug unit stationed at the airport who halted the loading confiscated the cocaine and arrested one man.
On the surface it was a victory albeit a small one in the effort to prevent Guatemala from slipping into the morass of drug related corruption and violence.
"It s very scary " said one foreign drug expert who requested anonymity.
Moreover a Western diplomat added In fact the aftermath of the seizure indicates that Central America s largest country already is suffering from the narcotics rot that is engulfing Colombia Peru Bolivia and Panama.
American and Guatemalan officials say well over 4 500 acres in the country s mountains and jungles are planted in amapola as the poppies used to produce heroin are called here.
That figure is twice last year s estimate and continues to grow so fast that opium production outstrips the production of marijuana Guatemala s traditional drug crop.
The American street value of Guatemalan produced heroin ranges from 2 billion to 5 billion experts estimate.
Beyond the home grown production of opium Guatemala is now a major transshipment point for South American produced cocaine destined for the United States.
Each week up to 1 000 kilograms (2 200 pounds) of cocaine is shipped through Guatemala nearly all to the United States according to foreign diplomats and drug experts.
And while 4 000 kilos of the drug have been seized here this year by Guatemalan police and the U.
Drug Enforcement Administration "obviously most get through " conceded one expert speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Foreign drug experts say that until now nearly all the production and shipment of Guatemalan cocaine have been controlled by the drug cartels operating out of the Colombian cities of Medellin and Cali.
However he says Guatemalans increasingly are getting into the business.
The incident at La Aurora is cited as an example of that growth and as a measure of how high the resulting corruption has reached into the government.
The man arrested was Jose Fernando Minero Navas a close associate of Col.
Hugo Francisco Moran Carranza at the time director of the Administrative Control Department President Vinicio Cerezo s anti corruption office.
Although Moran told local journalists that the airport arrest would be investigated he defended Minero Navas as Later the investigation was stopped and Moran resigned.
But he remains a close associate of Cerezo according to some sources.
More alarming than the aborted investigation have been the actions taken against the Guatemalan police who carried out the arrest and seizure.
One was shot and killed on the street while the others received death threats and have gone into hiding.
In spite of the statistics the seizures and the reputed involvement of ranking military and government officials in drug trafficking some diplomats and others say corruption is still limited to individuals and has not yet infested national institutions.
Guatemalan military intelligence officers are described as working fully and closely with the local U.
DEA office a small underfinanced operation of four Americans who have to cover Belize and El Salvador as well as Guatemala.
said one source adding Nonetheless the signs indicate that the narcotics problem has reached serious proportions.
The same source who praised military intelligence and police cooperation said that Associate of Candidate One commander alleged by Guatemalan sources to be involved is Gen.
Roberto Matta a close associate of Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo the odds on favorite to be elected president in next year s election and a protege of Gen.
Hector Alejandro Gramajo the army chief of staff.
Although diplomats and drug enforcement experts consider Gramajo a major asset in the anti drug effort he is expected to support Matta as his successor as head of the military.
Accusations of trafficking have even reached into the highest levels of government and politics.
Cabrera is the subject of constant rumors and charges of involvement in the cocaine business.
He denies the charges and says a DEA investigation has cleared him but drug agency sources in Washington said Cabrera has not been investigated directly.
When asked if the potential president was considered clean of any drug involvement one source replied "We haven t cleared him.
" Even diplomats who say there is no evidence that Cabrera is personally immersed in narcotic trafficking said that his image is poor.
And while no one has produced evidence of any connection with cocaine trafficking two Guatemalan police sources and other experts indicated that Cabrera used his authority to cover up the drug activity of one of his brothers.
One brother Vinicio Cabrera was convicted in 1984 of possession of 10 kilos of cocaine when arrested in January of that year at the Miami airport.
Cabrera acknowledged Vinicio s guilt but says there is no truth to charges that another brother Carlos was involved in a June 1988 plot to transship 54 kilos of cocaine from Panama to the United States.
Local and foreign sources say Carlos Cabrera had given a man named Eric A.
Ralda baggage claim checks to recover two suitcases containing the cocaine.
Ralda was arrested when he tried to pick up the bags which had been monitored on their flight from Panama.
The sources said Ralda confessed and implicated Carlos Cabrera who also allegedly was seen by a witness standing on a balcony overlooking the baggage claim area when the suitcases arrived.
According to the sources Ralda was released two days after his arrest the investigation was canceled and Cerezo s aides deny the incident ever took place.
Sources said the apparent reason for the acceptance by otherwise uninvolved government and military officials was to shore up the increasingly unstable Cerezo administration.
said one congressional deputy referring to a May 9 attempt by some army units to overthrow the Cerezo regime.
SEA CHASE GUNSHOTS LEAD TO TEXTBOOK CASE COCAINE BUST.
Federal agents who hauled in 2 700 pounds of cocaine 17 defendants and five boats described the bust Tuesday as a "textbook case" of how U.
The seizure of the freighter Nerma allegedly used as a smuggling "mother ship " as well as three speedboats and a trawler used to haul the cocaine to land was described by agents as the largest since President Bush announced his battle plan against drug trafficking.
Videotape provided by the Coast Guard showed a chase in which the speedboats tried to evade a persistent but slower Coast Guard craft which fired 43 warning shots near the speedboats.
The drug organization supervising the cocaine smuggling was based in Miami and had been under investigation for several months Drug Enforcement Administration agent Tom Cash said.
Federal agents moved in Sunday while cocaine reportedly was being unloaded from the Nerma in Bahamian waters.
The cocaine was believed to have originated in Medellin Colombia home of the Medellin cartel of cocaine traffickers and was loaded onto the freighter on the island of Aruba.
With Spain as their Continental base Colombian drug lords have gone to sea to supply a rich new cocaine market in Western Europe.
Spanish and foreign enforcement officials believe that each week more than a ton of South American cocaine is shipped to Western Europe most of it secreted in the avalanche of legitimate freight bound for European ports.
said one officer who collects intelligence on the movement of drugs.
Freighters unload container cargo at nearly two dozen ports in Spain alone where police made two thirds of Europe s cocaine seizures last year.
Booming Europe riding the crest of unprecedented prosperity lives on cross border trade now and plans to eliminate all internal frontiers by the end of 1992.
The Dutch port of Rotterdam for example handled more than 2 million containers last year.
And in Europe as in the United States only about 5 of freight is physically inspected by customs agents.
Although small shipments of cocaine reach Europe by commercial planes or on speedboats that load from ships offshore the new reliance on merchant ships is a function of geography and a hungry new market.
Europe is too far from South America to allow smuggling by the light planes that litter American skies.
Quickening European demand for cocaine has mushroomed beyond the capacity of small shipments to supply it or of police to control it.

Five years later with Latin American couriers and salespeople now firmly established in almost all countries in big cities and small Europe is learning firsthand what cocaine costs.

Crack for example is still a stranger to Europe but only because the street price is too high to make it profitable specialists say.

Last month Spanish police seized 200 kilos of cocaine impregnated into a seaborne shipment of Peruvian ponchos.
Earlier this year they found 300 kilos in a shipment of 30 000 Colombian coconuts.
Last year seizures included a record 1 000 kilos that had been shipped to a port near the French border and another 562 kilos in Barcelona.
Historically heroin has been the drug of choice for European addicts and the economic mainstay of criminal gangs that control it.
In another raid on a busy weekend Spanish police seized 109 kilos of Turkish heroin in southern Spain and arrested two Turks and a British woman.
There was speculation in the aftermath that the heroin might have been bound for the United States.
Spain got 479 of the 3 100 kilos of heroin seized in Europe last year.
said Miguel Solans a 44 year old attorney who is national coordinator of the Spanish government s quickening war against drugs.
But shipments remained relatively small and airborne until recently.
Last year European police seized 5 500 kilos.
Spanish authorities confiscated 3 461 kilos of the total more than half of it from ships cargo.
Now Spain is joining with Italy and the United States to aid Colombia Peru and Bolivia the countries where cocaine is born.

FEDERAL JUDGE IN MIAMI ENTERS NOT GUILTY PLEA FOR THE DEPOSED PANAMANIAN DICTATOR.
A YEAR OF PRETRIAL MANEUVERING BY HIS DEFENSE TEAM IS EXPECTED.
Nearly two years after he challenged the United States to bring him to justice on drug charges Manuel A.
Noriega stood before a federal judge in a heavily guarded Miami courtroom Thursday a defendant in the grasp of the U.
The deposed Panamanian dictator declared through his lawyers on his first day in the United States that the government has no legal jurisdiction to try him on drug trafficking charges here.
Hoeveler entered a plea of "not guilty" for Noriega at the arraignment and ordered that preparations begin for his trial on the charges which were handed down by a federal grand jury in February 1988.
The former leader who wore a freshly starched khaki Panamanian military uniform was remanded to the custody of U.
marshals for what could be a year of pretrial maneuverings by his legal defense team.
Noriega had reached the United States in predawn darkness after a 5 1 4 hour flight from Panama City aboard a U.
During the trip he was placed in handcuffs at least temporarily and was read in Spanish his constitutional rights to a lawyer and to remain silent.
His surrender Wednesday evening as he walked out the gate of the Vatican embassy where he had taken refuge on Christmas Eve ended a nearly two year campaign by two U.
administrations to remove him from power and bring him to the United States to face prosecution.
Accompanied by agents for the Drug Enforcement Administration Noriega landed early Thursday at Homestead Air Force Base 25 miles south of Miami and was believed to have been taken directly to the federal courthouse here.
A senior Bush Administration official speaking on condition of anonymity said Noriega s decision to surrender may have been clinched by word that his sanctuary "would expire" at noon Thursday.
The official speculated that faced with a growing crowd of angry Panamanians outside the embassy Noriega may have opted for the protection offered by U.
Noriega s arraignment began what is certain to be a drawn out legal affair.
It is uncertain whether the Adminstration can back up months of tough talk about Noriega s role in drug smuggling with a successful prosecution through uncharted legal principles.
First there is the knotty issue of arresting a former government leader beyond U.
Also Noriega s lawyers are expected to seek classified U.
documents dealing with his acknowledged past cooperation with the CIA and Drug Enforcement Administration.
They also are likely to argue that he cannot receive a fair trial because of adverse publicity.
Wears Gold Stars While marshals with binoculars scanned the downtown area from atop the courthouse Noriega was brought by private elevator to the crowded ninth floor courtroom from a basement jail cell.
On the shoulders of his khaki shirt he wore the gold stars of a general his rank as former chief of the Panama Defense Forces.
Using earphones to hear the judge s questions translated into Spanish by a court interpreter Noriega spoke little except to indicate three times that he understood the charges but would not enter a plea.
Noriega responded when Hoeveler asked him why he was remaining mute.
He appeared calm but subdued throughout the 25 minute proceeding.
Defense attorney Frank Rubino took the hearing by surprise by declaring at the outset that his client Rubino continued adding that Noriega s indictment on drug charges in Miami and Tampa Fla.
As a head of state Noriega had immunity from criminal charges by U.
But his attorney argued that Noriega was coerced saying that he had been warned that protection would be withdrawn as crowds surrounded the Vatican embassy.
Noriega surrendered to avoid further bloodshed Rubino told the court.
Dexter Lehtinen of Miami countered that the immunity question was settled long ago and that Noriega s surrender to U.
Rejected Claims Lehtinen referred to the fact that a year ago Hoeveler rejected defense claims that the United States had no jurisdiction over Noriega as a head of state.
The judge said then that the State Department had not recognized the general s political legitimacy.
officials said Noriega is likely to be kept for extended periods of time pending more pretrial hearings in a cell at the courthouse a modern structure with many amenities.
In previous cases involving accused narcotics traffickers defense lawyers have protested when their clients were moved for security reasons to federal prisons some distance away.
Rubino did not seek Noriega s release on bond because of his argument that the court does not have jurisdiction over Noriega.
It is doubtful that Hoeveler would have granted bail anyway.
One day after the quiet denouement of the nearly two year drama that began with the indictments the Bush Administration s celebrations were muted.
President Bush kept to an apparently low key schedule making no public appearances and no public comments about Noriega on Thursday.
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush spoke briefly by telephone with Pope John Paul II to thank the pontiff for the Vatican s help in persuading Noriega to surrender.
A senior White House official said the reaction within the White House to Noriega s decision to leave the protection of the Vatican embassy generally was subdued.
But the low key approach was also intentional.
It reflected the Administration s sensitivity to the need to avoid making statements that could be considered prejudicial in a court of law and that could thus provide Noriega s defense attorneys with grounds to argue that government officials public comments make it impossible to find an impartial jury.
The Administration which aggressively denounced Noriega in earlier days as a "narco terrorist " sharply toned down its rhetoric to language that would be acceptable in a courtroom.
Before Bush announced Noriega s surrender White House lawyers took the unusual step of reviewing every word in the brief statement that the President delivered to a national television audience Wednesday evening.
They were making sure that it included no remarks that could risk damaging the impartiality of a jury.
Steven Kollin Rubino s co counsel representing Noriega said before the court appearance that He also said that secret documents spelling out his client s ties to the CIA raising the shadow of conflict with the Justice Department over disclosing government secrets.

Noriega meanwhile was described by Archbishop Marcos G.

24 Noriega threw the United States the new Panamanian government and the Pope into what Bush called a three way "conundrum.
" The matter came to a head according to a senior Bush Administration official when the papal nuncio Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa decided that Noriega s asylum would expire by noon Thursday.
When he left the embassy Noriega asked for a memento and left a letter to the Pope Navarro said.
The memento chosen was said to be a Bible and the letter s contents are not known.
Laboa was forwarding the sealed letter by diplomatic pouch to the Vatican.
Montalbano in Rome also contributed to this report.
Noriega and 12 others were indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami in February 1988 on 12 counts of taking part in a criminal enterprise in violation of the U.

RECORD 2 700 ACRE ESTATE SEIZED IN DRUG CASE.
The wooded 2 700 acre riverfront estate of a convicted cocaine smuggler was seized by federal marshals Saturday in the largest land forfeiture action ever against a U.
James West said investigators believe Frederik Luytjes had intended to return to the 2.
8 million Mastwood estate in the Pocono Mountain region after he completes his 10 year prison sentence for cocaine trafficking.
District Court in Scranton alleged that Luytjes had purchased the property with cocaine profits making it subject to seizure under federal drug laws.
Luytjes 47 allegedly used his charter aircraft business Air America Inc.
to provide planes and recruit pilots for a smuggling operation that imported 10 tons of Medellin cartel supplied cocaine into the United States from Colombia between 1980 and 1985.
West said Mastwood represented the largest tract of land ever seized in the United States in a drug related forfeiture action.
The government previously seized about 18 million in cash and other assets from Luytjes and his associates.
FOUR LEADERS ANNOUNCE NO SPECIFIC NEW STEPS TO FIGHT TRAFFICKING.
THE NEED FOR FINANCIAL AID TO ANDEAN NATIONS IS STRESSED.
President Bush flew here for his much heralded summit with three Latin American presidents Thursday and proclaimed after about three hours of meetings that the four nations have formed "the first anti drug cartel.
" An 11 page "Declaration of Cartagena" signed by Bush and the presidents of Colombia Bolivia and Peru said that fighting drug traffic requires effective efforts to reduce demand for drugs in consuming countries and to stimulate economic development in producing countries.
Bush promised in the document to seek congressional approval of new funds to The communique also pledges the four governments to control chemicals used in refining cocaine share money and properties seized from traffickers exchange intelligence information and control weapons planes and other equipment used in drug trafficking.
However the presidents Bush Peru s Alan Garcia Bolivia s Jaime Paz Zamora and Colombia s Virgilio Barco Vargas did not discuss extradition of drug criminals specific levels of American economic aid or the use of the U.
military to fight the drug traffic according to Bush s spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
and South American officials negotiated details of the document until Wednesday night before coming to final agreement.
A source close to the talks said that the American negotiators wanted to put the major emphasis on police and military repression of drug trafficking but they yielded to the South Americans insistence that greater emphasis should be put on the need for financial aid and economic development as necessary conditions for controlling the traffic.
The South American governments reluctantly acceded to a U.
demand for a clause specifying that the armed forces of the three South American countries may participate in the fight against trafficking the source said.
The Colombian military already is involved but the military leaders of Peru and Bolivia have balked at joining police in anti drug efforts.
Fitzwater described the meeting as Others took a somewhat more skeptical view.
asked Peru s Garcia during a joint press conference at the end of the summit.
Despite the question the four participants each pronounced themselves basically happy with the meeting.
While no specific new steps were agreed upon they said the fact that the four presidents met at all was an important advance.
Paz said at the joint press conference adding that he was "fully satisfied" with the results.
"For the first time " said Garcia That fact he declared marks the beginning of "a new collaborative approach" and a "new chapter" in relations between Latin America and the United States.
The meeting said Bush "demonstrates solidarity" between the United States the world s largest consumer of cocaine and the three nations that are the chief sources of the drug.
Paz said the communique shows that the United States now accepts the idea that coca leaf production cannot be curtailed without major economic support for the economies of the coca growing countries Bolivia and Peru.
The document states But Paz said the South American presidents recognized that U.
budget problems make it difficult for Bush to promise all the aid needed.
he said but other developed countries should also help with financial support.
In the communique the United States also pledged of the three Andean countries.
It agreed to work with them But the presidents declaration left several major questions unresolved.
Barco for example denied news reports that his government had made a deal with traffickers.
" And although he insisted that drug traffickers must he made no commitment that the Colombian government would continue to send at least some of those who did surrender to the United States to face trial.
Extradition is the fate that members of the Colombia drug cartels apparently fear most.
When the assassination of a popular presidential candidate by traffickers last August prompted Barco to revive an extradition treaty with the United States the cartels fought back with a campaign of terror.
Recently messages from the traffickers have indicated that they would end their war with the government and get out of the illicit drug trade.
Observers say their aim is to persuade Barco to drop extradition.
Separately the United States and Peru agreed to make a separate exchange of diplomatic notes reinforcing their commitment to the extradition of accused drug traffickers.
Bush for his part pledged to continue to seek economic aid to help wean the economies of the three Andean nations from cocaine.
But he made no commitment to a total amount and specifically said that the United States would not try to match the loss of cocaine revenue "dollar for dollar" or "job for job.
The South American nations should try to end coca production despite the economic costs because is "immoral.
" Bolivia s President Paz however painted a picture of how difficult that will be for his impoverished country.
He said upon his arrival Tuesday night that coca accounts for half of its national economy.
In a separate bilateral agreement with Colombia the United States pledged to try to open the U.
market to additional Colombian exports that would replace drugs but again Bush made no specific promises.
American consumers he said when asked about efforts to increase the international price of coffee one of Colombia s largest legal exports.
The United States and Peru also signed an agreement permitting the exchange of tax records bank statements and other information to uncover illicit drug profits and trace drug money laundering.
Bush also repeated his pledge to continue efforts to reduce demand for drugs in America an important symbol for South American leaders who for years have bridled at what they argue is unfair American pressure to destroy coca crops the main source of income for hundreds of thousands of otherwise impoverished peasants while United States does little to reduce the demand that fuels the drug trade.
Next to demand reduction Colombia s Barco said as he welcomed the three other leaders to the summit site a Colombian navy base on a small peninsula jutting out into the placid waters of Cartagena Bay.
he said The aspect of the summit that was almost certainly the most carefully watched in the United States was a question answered before the meetings even began.
Bush proved he could travel to Colombia safely.
For weeks the question of the President s security here has dominated discussions of the meeting.
Despite qualms by his security staff and worries of many Americans Bush insisted on traveling here saying that to do otherwise would send a message of no confidence in the Barco government.
Administration officials Thursday continued their conflicting messages about the degree of danger.
White House officials warned reporters and staff members not to wander from "secure areas" and not to accept any packages or gifts.
Other Administration officials however said they thought the concern over security which had led the White House to keep the bulk of the press corps in Barranquilla about 60 miles from the meeting site had been overstated.
The worries were "overblown " Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson told reporters on Air Force One as Bush flew south before dawn Thursday morning.
Although security was tight few unusual precautions were apparent.
Air Force One made a fast low approach to the airport at Barranquilla.
Bush spent a few minutes greeting dignitaries at the airport then boarded a Marine helicopter which sped off for Cartagena.
Accompanied by three other helicopters carrying press staff and Secret Service agents the President s helicopter flew at high speed and low altitude along the coast sending flocks of egrets swirling into the air from the marshes below.
Peru s President Garcia had threatened to not attend the summit because of the U.
He changed his position only after the United States announced that all invading troops would be withdrawn by the end of February.
Arriving Thursday morning in Cartagena Garcia indicated that the invasion was not be a subject for discussion.
he added to the Peruvian president who even without the elevator shoes he wore is a couple of inches taller and quite a few pounds heavier than the six foot two inch Bush.
Taking a brief stroll in the humid ocean breeze before their meeting Bush chatted with the three other heads of state in a small courtyard of an old fort located on the peninsula as raucous tropical birds crowed nearby and flocks of small yellow warblers darted between branches of bright pink bougainvillea.
"I love it beautiful " said Bush BACKGROUND Cartagena was once a major storage port for the treasure laden galleons of the Spanish Main.
An extensive network of fortresses and ramparts with walls 50 feet thick in places was built by Spain to protect hoards of gold and jewels from pirates and privateers who attacked the city repeatedly.
Sir Francis Drake captured Cartagena in 1586 but for a payment of 10 million pesos did not burn it down.
But in 1741 its mightiest fortress San Felipe honeycombed with tunnels and passages resisted a massive assault by 27 000 men and 3 000 pieces of artillery led by the English buccaneer Edward Vernon.
Well restored and well maintained Cartagena s Old City today is one of the best preserved colonial era districts in South America.
It has often been used as a set for films seeking to recreate authentic period locales including that of "The Mission " starring Robert De Niro.
THE TALK OF CARTAGENA The anti drug war brought the leaders of the United States the biggest consumer of illegal drugs and the major producing nations Colombia Peru and Bolivia together at a summit in Cartagena Colombia.

The Justice Department moved Tuesday to obtain records from 173 banks on hundreds of accounts in which Colombian drug kingpins allegedly deposited nearly 400 million from selling cocaine in the United States.
Department attorneys seeking clues to complex money laundering operations of the Medellin cartel obtained federal court orders requiring the banks and other financial institutions to turn over information from 754 suspect accounts.
The court orders require the banks to freeze three quarters of the accounts the first step toward seizing any remaining deposits.
Dick Thornburgh said the tactic is designed He described money as "the drug traffickers lifeblood" and said.
However the prospect of recovering substantial amounts directly from the accounts is "remote " said Peter G.
Djinis a trial attorney in the Justice Department s narcotics section who has been involved in the crackdown from the outset.
That is because most of the funds which totaled an estimated 400 million in early 1989 probably have been moved elsewhere since then or spent on the cartel s operations in the United States.
Officials said the 754 accounts are spread across 22 states including California as well as the District of Columbia.
They are held in many of the nation s largest financial institutions including the Bank of America and Security Pacific National Bank.
officials stressed however that there is no indication that any of the 173 banks knew about the true source of the funds in the accounts.
said David Runkel Thornburgh s chief spokesman.
Djinis noted that bank cooperation had led to some of the early successes of Operation Polar Cap the government s crackdown on drug money laundering.
He said the real value of the court orders the latest phase of the Operation Polar Cap money laundering crackdown will come from helping the government to obtain details about laundering operations and to trace the current location of the funds.
The interest in the bank records grew out of the March 6 1989 indictment of four Medellin cartel members Pablo Escobar Jorge Ochoa Gustavo Gaviria and Geraldo Moncada and others on charges of importing tons of cocaine and marijuana into the United States from Colombia.
2 billion in drug sale profits had been laundered mainly through New York banks into foreign accounts controlled by the cartel mostly in Panama Uruguay and other countries.
Thornburgh and Brady in a joint statement said Tuesday s action resulted from The eight countries were identified as Colombia Panama Uruguay Luxembourg Switzerland the United Kingdom Canada and Austria.
Last January after the ouster of Panamanian strongman Manuel A.
Noriega the new government of Panama agreed to U.
requests for records of bank accounts identified as having been used by cartel money launderers.
Examination of those and other foreign accounts disclosed that almost 350 million of the 1.
drug sales had been transferred by wire back to U.
An additional 50 million is believed never to have left U.
accounts to provide working capital for its daily activities in America and to maintain its payroll.
Djinis the narcotics section attorney said the cartel used imaginative covers for its accounts.
One was maintained under the name of a 2 year old relative of a cartel member.
Despite attempts to disguise the real ownership however the accounts frequently contain a common element such as an address or a telephone or facsimile machine number linked to cartel members the Justice Department said in papers filed in U.
The records Djinis said are expected to provide Federal investigators believe the cartel has purchased real estate in the United States something the bank records could corroborate according to Djinis.
Some of the funds he said have been used for In California court orders were sought for accounts held in seven banks and one brokerage house.
They are Bank of America s offices in Los Angeles and San Jose Security Pacific National Bank and Mercantile National Bank in Los Angeles Foothill Independent Bank in Glendora Merrill Lynch in San Diego and Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of the Orient in San Francisco.
Spokesmen for several of the institutions said they will cooperate with authorities.
said Peter Magnani a spokesman for the Bank of America in San Francisco.
Kim Kellogg a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo noted that the bank had helped start Operation Polar Cap by reporting to authorities unusually large deposits by firms found to be operating as launderers.
ARMS SCANDAL COULD FORCE OUT ANTIGUA RULERS.
ISRAELI SHIPMENT OF MACHINE GUNS AND RIFLES WOUND UP IN THE HANDS OF A COLOMBIA DRUG BARON.
A festering scandal over illicit arms sent from Israel to Antigua last year and then mysteriously transshipped to the Colombian drug cartel has embarrassed Washington and Jerusalem and may bring down the corruption ridden family ruled government of this Caribbean microstate.
In the still shadowy transaction an illegal shipment of 100 Uzi submachine guns 400 Galil assault rifles and 250 000 rounds of ammunition ostensibly ordered for Antigua s 70 man Defense Force went instead to Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha one of the top three barons of the Medellin drug cartel.
Rodriguez Gacha was shot and killed last December by Colombian police.
A purchase order purporting to legitimize the shipment and guarantee Antigua as its final destination bore the name of the elder son of Prime Minister Vere C.
Bird 81 year old patriarch of the scandal prone clan that has dominated this two island Caribbean nation formally called Antigua and Barbuda since 1951.
Although there is no such post in Antigua the document identified the son Vere Bird Jr.
" Despite the irregularity of the guarantee the fictitious title and the disproportionate quantity of arms for such a small security force Israel apparently accepted the suspect document in place of the customary "end user certificate" routinely required in government to government arms deals officials here said.
one official said speaking on condition of anonymity.
The officials said Israeli complicity was also suggested by the presence of an Israeli army officer who escorted the arms to Antigua but raised no objection when in an evidently prearranged switch the arms were transferred with the help of Antiguan customs officials to a Colombia bound ship only hours after they arrived on April 24 1989.
A controversial Israeli entrepreneur Maurice Sarfati sought by authorities in both Antigua and the United States after defaulting on U.
Klein a former anti terrorist officer of the Israeli army who has been charged in Jerusalem with illegally providing military equipment and training to Colombians are other key figures in the scandal.
The gunshot riddled body of a third Israeli Arik Afek a known Klein associate was found stuffed in the trunk of a car at Miami International Airport last Jan.
24 and the Miami police are trying to determine whether he too was involved.
When news of the arms scandal broke last April following a formal diplomatic protest by Colombia attention focused on Vere Jr.
53 as the key Antiguan official involved in engineering the scheme.
His brother Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird 52 was first to point a finger not only implicating Vere Jr.
but also hiring Washington lawyer Lawrence Barcella a former assistant U.
attorney for the District of Columbia famed for tracking down rogue CIA agent Edwin Wilson in Libya in the early 1980s to investigate.
Lester Bird s hostility toward Vere Jr.
In a struggle that has often assumed the qualities of a melodramatic soap opera the millionaire brothers both London trained lawyers have been vying "like Cain and Abel " as Vere Jr.
once put it to succeed their faltering octogenarian father now serving his sixth five year term as prime minister.
The elder Bird has remained largely out of the fray and out of public sight shielded in recent years by his protective 27 year old mistress Cutie Francis a powerful local businesswoman who has been at his side since she was a 14 year old beauty queen.
But protests concerning the arms scandal forced "Papa" Bird as he is known here to go public last month and order an official commission of inquiry run by an impartial London jurist.
No matter how the inquiry turns out all three Birds may already have suffered fatal political damage from the arms scandal according to opposition politicians and some of their allies in the Antigua Labor Party.
said Baldwin Spencer opposition leader in the 17 member Parliament.
Luce minister of finance and longtime Papa Bird supporter said.
Unless investigators turn up an innocent explanation of Israel s role in the incident Jerusalem too stands to suffer from the scandal.
Although Israel may not have known that the guns were destined for the drug cartel said an official who has closely followed the investigation.
He said that ever since part of the arms shipment was discovered on the late drug lord s Colombian ranch last Feb.
2 Israel has been "dragging its heels" and offering only token cooperation to Antiguan investigators trying to unravel the scandal.
A Washington congressional source familiar with details of the scandal said he believes the Bush Administration has so far stood aloof because it does not want to make diplomatic trouble for Israel or get entangled in an explosive internal quarrel here that might endanger agreements that permit highly secretive U.
Navy and Air Force bases to operate without restriction.
If Klein the former Israeli army officer can be believed Washington may be covering up its own role in the affair.
Klein s link to the drug lords was disclosed last year when a U.
television network showed him supervising the arms training of men Colombian authorities identified as drug cartel assassins.
He said a few weeks ago in an unsworn statement that it all began with plans to build a "survival school" on the island.
Earlier Klein told the Miami Herald that the deal grew out of a 1988 attempt to establish a base on Antigua where pro U.
rebel forces could be trained to topple former Panama strongman Manuel A.
officials in planning the never activated training base but that the anti Noriega Panamanians involved in the deal might have had.
The State Department says it has expressed "concern about these arms" to Israel.
Richard Boucher a department spokesman said in early May.
Antiguan officials doubt that their commission of inquiry will get enough cooperation from either Jerusalem or Washington to untangle the intrigue behind the arms transfer.
DRUG LORDS TARGET EUROPE REPORT SAYS.
Colombian drug cartels and the Mafia are building a cocaine empire in Western European countries which have replaced the United States as the biggest market for the drug Bogota s El Tiempo newspaper reported citing a joint study by the international police organization Interpol and the Colombian intelligence police.
The Bogota offices of both Interpol and the intelligence police were closed Sunday and no one could be reached for comment.
The European market will continue to grow because of the Italian Mafia s intention to preserve its distribution monopoly and the Colombian cartels desire to capture part of the market according to the study.
Henry Hamman focuses on the former Panamanian leader s attempts to fend off US drugs charges.
FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega s defence against drug trafficking charges in Miami gained ground this week.
A Drug Enforcement Administration agent acknowledged that a man identified by the prosecution as a Medelln cocaine cartel money launderer had been arrested on the basis of information from forces commanded by Gen Noriega.
Bramble in charge of the DEA s Panama operations from August 1982 until June 1984 raised questions about earlier prosecution claims that Gen Noriega had protected the cartel s operations in Panama in return for pay offs.
Prosecutors had cited the money launderer Mr Ramon Milian Rodriguez as a conduit for drug money from the US to bank accounts controlled by the cartel in Panama.
According to the DEA Mr Milian was responsible for transferring Dollars 200m in drug profits from the US to Panama.
Mr Bramble acknowledged that the information that led to Mr Milian s arrest had been independently developed by Panamanian narcotics officers and passed on to the DEA.
When Mr Milian was arrested in Florida government agents seized Dollars 5.
5m in cash more than 61 pounds of cocaine and a Lear jet aircraft.
In other testimony former DEA agent Mr Arthur Sedillo stationed in Panama from August 1977 until August 1979 read a cable from the then chief administrator of the DEA Mr Peter Bensinger in which Mr Bensinger asked that Gen Noriega be congratulated for his role in an impressive seizure of cocaine being smuggled to the US via Panama.
The defence by calling current and former government officials and requiring them to read documents they wrote on Gen Noriega s efforts in drug law enforcement is attempting to counter the prosecution claim that Gen Noriega turned Panama into a haven for Colombian drug dealers.
Mr Bensinger and another former DEA chief administrator Mr John Lawn argued that the kind words they may have written about Gen Noriega were diplomatic niceties rather than statements of fact.
But letters and memoranda by Mr Sedillo and Mr Bramble also referred to co operation between the DEA and Panamanian forces under Gen Noriega s command.
Mr Frank Rubino lead defence counsel said in an interview that showing the extent of this co operation was a central part of the defence strategy.
When Mr Bramble has testified he is expected to be followed by another DEA agent who worked in Panama.
Mr May and Mr Rubino expect to finish presenting their case in 4 6 weeks when the prosecution is expected to offer a rebuttal.
FT 10 APR 92 Noriega guilty on main counts in drugs trial.
A FEDERAL jury in Miami yesterday found General Manuel Antonio Noriega former leader of Panama guilty on eight of ten drug trafficking and conspiracy charges.
The verdict after nearly five days of deliberation means that Gen Noriega could face up to 120 years in US jails.
The trial was the first by the US of a foreign head of government.
The general was brought to the US in chains in January 1990 after the invasion of Panama by US forces the previous month.
For the US government particularly for the Bush administration the decision to try Gen Noriega as a common criminal was a risky move.
The verdict will be widely seen as affirming Mr Bush s decision to send US forces into Panama to topple the general.
The charges stood on a US claim that Gen Noriega had entered a conspiracy with the Medelln cocaine cartel based in Colombia to use Panama as a route for the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine to the US and as a haven for the laundering of drug profits.
The US prosecutors portrayed the general as having sold out his country in return for millions of dollars in bribes.
The jury agreed with the prosecution s charge that Gen Noriega had used President Fidel Castro of Cuba to mediate in a dispute between him and the cartel.
This verdict itself is likely to be used by supporters of a strengthened US trade embargo against Cuba an issue being debated in Congress.
Conviction on these two alone means he could face 40 years in jail and Dollars 500 000 in fines.
The verdict came a day after the jury had pronounced itself deadlocked and been ordered to return to deliberations by the trial judge.
The only two counts on which the jury found the general not guilty involved smuggling of several hundred kilogrammes of cocaine on a pleasure boat.
The convictions relieve the US of the possibility of much embarrassment arising from an acquittal.
The administration might have faced questions about why it went to so much trouble for no avail especially as the establishment of a democratic and anti drug government in Panama now appears to be in doubt.
The Bush administration has deployed vast sums to bring Gen Noriega to book Dollars 164m spent on the invasion of Panama in 1989 and some Dollars 20m on the trial.
There is little likelihood that the US will be encouraged by its success against Gen Noriega to use the same approach again in the near future.
In pursuing its claims against Colonel Muammer Gadaffi of Libya for example the administration has preferred to work through the UN.
A message from the Mafia Robert Graham on the official approach to organised crime.
THE IMPACT of the assassination of Mr Giovanni Falcone Italy s leading anti Mafia magistrate will take a long time to erase.
Mr Falcone was killed along with his wife and three bodyguards on May 24 when a ton of high explosive was detonated under their three car convoy as it travelled at high speed along a motorway near Palermo airport.
The indiscriminate means employed were more reminiscent of the Lebanese militias or the Colombian drugs barons but this horrendous crime has been unequivocally attributed to the Sicilian Mafia.
As a campaigning magistrate Mr Falcone s investigations led to a series of maxi trials of the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s.
He made extensive use for the first time of pentiti (informers who have plea bargained equivalent to a super grass ) and he was able to demonstrate that the Mafia was not a casual group of criminals but a complex organisation with a hierarchy of command linking the various families and their businesses.
Mr Falcone had already been the subject of a failed assassination attempt in 1989 and was one of the most heavily guarded people in the country.
At least 60 people were assigned to his full time protection and his movements were kept deeply confidential.
The killing was a deliberate challenge to the state similar to the assassination in 1982 of General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and his wife days after he had taken up the post of prefect of Palermo.
Just as the Dalla Chiesa killing prodded the government of the day to react with a series of police and judicial measures to aid the fight against the Mafia so did the Falcone murder.
The procedures for bail of suspected Mafia members were tightened magistrates were given greater freedom to pursue investigations and new mechanisms were introduced for better co ordination of police work.
This reactive approach has characterised government action towards organised crime ever since the Second World War.
For instance last September when Mr Libero Grassi a Palermo businessman was murdered for publicly refusing to pay Mafia extortion demands the authorities amid much breast beating agreed to introduce new anti extortion measures.
These included special hot lines to denounce racketeers and financial assistance to those suffering losses as a result of extortion demands (insurance coverage for fire damage etc).
The measures became operative in June almost nine months after approved in cabinet.
Police action tends to tackle the effects of organised crime not its causes.
Too often new measures are simply added to existing ones creating confusion.
Last year as a more generalised response to the spread of organised crime the Andreotti government decided to create a special structure within the magistrature to deal exclusively with investigations into the Mafia.
This consists of a super magistrate and 26 assistants countrywide.
However the lines of authority still remain unclear.
The magistrates are wary of the new body because it smacks of direct government control a wrangle which has delayed the introduction of the new structure.
Indeed before Mr Falcone s death his candidature to be the first head of this body was being blocked for fear that his appointment was too political.
At the same time the Anti Mafia Commissariat which had previously co ordinated such investigations is being wound up.
Organised crime has traditionally been a southern phenomenon associated with three groups each distinguished by clear geographical and historical characteristics Cosa Nostra the Sicilian Mafia.
the Camorra based round Naples and the ndrangheta of Calabria.
The Mafia though retaining its strong Sicilian roots has spread to Rome and the main cities of northern Italy.
It has the biggest international connections through drugs dealing arms trafficking and money laundering.
the Camorra heavily into contraband has spread into central and parts of northern Italy and latterly has developed ties with Colombia as well moving into eastern Europe.
The ndrangheta has remained the most local and continues to specialise in kidnaps.
In the 1980s the international spread of drugs (cocaine from Latin America heroin from Turkey central Asia and the south east Asia) advances in telecommunications liberalisation of banking freer trade and the opening of eastern Europe provided an enormous stimulus to the growth of Italian organised crime.
More recently civil conflict in the Balkans has created fresh opportunities.
while within Italy criminal activity is increasing well above the European average.
A third of all homicides is attributed to organised crime in Italy.
Between 1985 and 1990 the number of murders doubled while in Britain and Germany the rate declined.
Indeed organised crime has become so entrenched that not only is it going to be increasingly hard to eradicate.
but it is becoming ever more difficult to distinguish between licit and illicit funds.
A report released earlier this year by Censis the social research institute said the annual turnover of organised crimes illicit and licit activities was L19 389bn.
The Censis report estimated 19 per cent of earnings came from licit activities the control of public contracts.
In Sicily over 75 per cent of public contracts do not even go out to tender and virtually all the latter are considered to be controlled by the Mafia.
The main source of income equivalent to 20 per cent of all earnings comes from drugs dealing.
theft generates a further 18 per cent followed by extortion (11 per cent) illegal gaming and lotteries (7 per cent and especially important round Naples) and contraband (4 per cent).
In 1990 criminals hijacked 6 899 trucks and articulated lorries over 90 per cent of all such crimes committed in Europe.
The favourite loads were clothing and electronic equipment which were sold in friendly stores or in clandestine supermarkets in southern Italy.
The value of the average load was estimated at a minimum of L100m and only 3 581 trucks were ever recovered.
The takings for these criminal gangs were estimated at over L1 300bn.
One gang arrested last year was charged with 1 600 such thefts over five years.
Hijacking of cargoes has become such a problem that insurance is difficult to find in southern Italy.
The Italian state has the resources to combat such crime.
There are some 250 000 carabinieri police and financial police the highest number per capita of population in Europe.
But they remain poorly co ordinated and eternal rivals.
The organisation of political parties in the south and the entire economic structure dominated by state funding encourages and permits a fecund parternship of crime and politics.
Beyond this the legal system is so unwieldy that criminals easily escape prosecution either through procedural devices or through the complex demands of proof the security forces have detailed lists of the Mafia families.
In the final resort the criminals still have the power to bribe and intimidate the judiciary.
The murder of Mr Falcone was one such message.
and now the government has been obliged to seek special volunteers to pursue the investigation into his killing.
FT 29 SEP 92 International swoop cracks big cocaine smuggling ring.
ITALIAN and US police said yesterday they had smashed one of the world s biggest cocaine smuggling and money laundering networks in a huge international swoop that had led to the arrest of more than 200 suspects.
The 34 people arrested in Italy included two kingpins of Colombian cocaine cartels and members of Italian Mafia families.
Some 167 people were arrested in the US including a senior executive of Colombia s national bank.
Two people were arrested in Costa Rica and police said they had found a huge cache of drug money in Britain.
The swoop called Operation Green Ice took some 10 months to plan and most of the arrests were made last week.
It was carried out jointly by Italian police and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.
The drugs organisation used intricate methods including bank accounts couriers and ships as well as dummy and real companies in many countries to smuggle cocaine from South America to Europe.
Some of the money to pay for the drugs was then sent back to South America via bank accounts and companies in Austria the US and Switzerland.
Officials said the most significant arrest in Italy was that of Jose Tony the Pope Duran 38.
One Italian anti Mafia official called him the most important distributor in the world of cocaine for the Colombian drug cartels.
Mr Duran alleged to be the head of the Pereira cartel was arrested at a bar in Rome last week.
UK investigators said they had arrested two men believed to be Americans in the Kensington area of London last Friday and seized 43kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of Pounds 7m during their contribution to Operation Green Ice.
Customs officers and police also seized nearly Pounds 2.
5m of what is believed to be drug laundered money from various locations including a lock up garage in south east London.
The men arrested in the UK were being held and questioned at an undisclosed London location.
Mr Douglas Tweddle chief UK customs investigator said last night.
FT 14 OCT 92 Hard times and loose banking draw Nigerians to drugs trade.
Plenty of couriers and a free wheeling financial sector have turned Lagos into world s leading source of trafficking.
TO DRUG enforcement officers they are known as swallowers or mules and in recent years Nigerians who ingest condoms and balloons filled with heroin and cocaine have emerged as the world s leading drug traffickers.
British officials say more Nigerians were arrested in the last three years trying to smuggle narcotics into the UK than any other nationals.
And in the US customs agents estimate that sophisticated Nigerian drug rings account for more than 40 per cent of heroin seizures at US ports of entry.
The multi million dollar illicit trade in drugs is tightly controlled by Nigerians who use Lagos as a transit station and exploit the country s loose banking system porous borders and a police and customs force notorious for corruption.
Hundreds of kilogrammes of Asian heroin mostly from India Thailand and the Golden triangle and cocaine from South America pass through Lagos for storage and repackaging before onward shipment to the US and Europe.
Nigeria has also become the second largest world supplier of cannabis after Ghana exporting 5 940lb last year.
Last year US customs agents seized 526lb of white heroin with a street value of Dollars 23.
In the first five months of 1992 seizures had increased to 361lb.
Officials say it is impossible to know what percentage of drugs smuggled into Europe and the US are seized but estimates vary from 5 to 40 per cent.
For customs officers the difficulty with the Nigerian drug rings stem from the large quantity of swallowers that are used and the increasing sophistication of the cartels.
The greatest problem according to one drug enforcement officer is that western prison sentences offer no deterrent to potential smugglers.
Five years in a western prison with three meals a day television the chance to get an education and earn some pocket money is no deterrent to a Nigerian making Dollars 30 a month who is suddenly offered Dollars 5 000 to make a drug run the official said.
The Nigerian connection in the international drugs trade first surfaced around 1984 85 and has grown as the economy of the once rich oil producer has plummeted.
Nigerians have seen one of the fastest declines in living standards with gross domestic product per capita falling from Dollars 1 000 in 1980 to Dollars 370 in 1986.
Nigerian drug barons have also flourished in a country where it is easy to launder drug money through the free wheeling banking sector and where the recently established National Drug Law Enforcement Agency is inadequately funded.
Western drug officials also say that widespread corruption in the police force customs service and even in the judiciary and the absence of tough conspiracy laws has protected Nigerians from being arrested and brought to trial.
Earlier this year Mr Frank Odita Nigeria s police commissioner said that 13 judges and a policeman had been implicated in the illegal release of 120 suspects awaiting trial on trafficking charges.
Many were freed using forged bail bonds and release orders.
The NDLEA itself has also faced accusations that some of its agents are being paid off by the drug rings.
Last year the agency s arrest rate fell sharply and so far it has yet to achieve a big conviction.
Mr Adeogba admits that not everybody in the agency is a saint but says that the critical problem facing the agency has been insufficient support for training funding and sharing of Nigerian controlled drug assets seized overseas.
He says last year 72 per cent of the Dollars 1bn of drug related assets seized by the US Drug Enforcement Agency were controlled by Nigerians and that some of these funds should be given to Nigeria to help fight the drug war.
Western donors however say that until the agency cleans up its record and spends the money it does receive more efficiently it is difficult to justify further funding.
FT 16 JAN 93 Italian authorities arrest alleged top Mafia chief.
THE ITALIAN authorities yest erday achieved a breakthrough in the fight against organised crime with the capture of Mr Salvatore Toto Riina acknowledged to be the boss of Cosa Nostra the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia.
Mr Riina who has been on the run since 1969 is wanted in connection with some 80 killings.
Police believe he was behind the assassination last year of the two leading anti Mafia magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.
This is an extraordinary blow (to the Mafia) and we hope this arrest will have significant repercussions said Mr Nicola Mancino the interior minister.
The Mafia has not been beaten but we have arrested a very dangerous mafioso he added.
Mr Riina s arrest exemplifies the determination of the government of Mr Giuliano Amato to combat organised crime and break the long standing protection given to the Mafia by elements of the Italian state and among the political parties.
The arrest was made in Palermo when special units of the Carabinieri stopped a Citroen in which Mr Riina was driving with another person.
Mr Riina presented false papers but offered no resistance.
In the style of a true Mafia boss he was unarmed.
Earlier this week Mr Mancino told journalists his main objective this year was the capture of Mr Riina.
The fact that he was arrested in Palermo confirmed what many Mafia experts suspected in spite of being Italy s most wanted criminal he felt he had enough protection to remain in his native Sicily.
Furthermore police had previously said they believed he had undergone plastic surgery.
but photographs showed that the 62 year old Mafia boss had merely aged.
Mr Giuseppe Ayala an investigating magistrate and close friend of Falcone and Borsellino said.
It is a big blow but a certain bitterness remains given that Mr Riina was arrested in Palermo after being more than 20 years on the run.
The son of a poor smallholder Mr Riina has been involved in organised crime since his early teens and married into one of the traditional Mafia families of Corleone.
On the run for more than 40 years the only time he was caught he escaped from house arrest in 1969 near Bologna.
Nicknamed Toto the short Mr Riina was first identified in 1984 as the new head of the cupola the council representing 14 leading Sicilian clans by Mr Tommaso Buscetta.
Mr Buscetta was the first top member of Cosa Nostra to break with the code of omerta (silence) and agree to turn state s evidence after his clan had been defeated in a bloody power struggle won by Mr Riina and his Corleone clan.
Greater protection and incentives granted last year to repentant mafiosi pentiti have encouraged more Mafia members to give evidence against their bosses.
This is believed to have played an important part in the government s recent successes in capturing leading Mafia figures.
Among those talking under special protection is Mr Riina s former chauffeur.
Mr Riina is reported to have created many enemies by his rejection of the traditional consensual way of dealing with the main Cosa Nostra clans.
Instead he imposed a bloody dictatorial rule enforced by an army of some 500 gunmen.
Buoyed by the enormous profits from the international drugs trade during the 1980s he abandoned the old policy of seeking an accommodation with the state escalating confrontation with schemes for promoting an independent Sicily.
The most dramatic instances of challenging the state were the murders of Falcone and Borsellino.
These killings were the catalyst in forcing the authorities to act with greater determination in turn prompting more people to inform on the Mafia.
The authorities have also begun to arrest politicians in Sicily seize assets disband Mafia controlled municipalities and deploy the army in force.
The authorities warned that Cosa Nostra might counterattack violently to remind Italians that the organisation s fate did not depend upon the fate of Mr Riina.
Italy moves to promote share ownership Page 2 Berlusconi s brother for trial over political funds Page 2.
IT SEEMS that whenever there is an Italian scandal there is a Swiss connection.
From the Chiasso affair in the late 1970s through to the Tangentopoli affair that is now shaking Italy s entire political system Swiss banks always appear in a prominent if rather sleazy role.
Last week yet another connection emerged when Mr Pierfrancesco Pacini Battaglia was named as one of the main intermediaries funnelling kickbacks from Eni the Italian state energy group to political parties.
Mr Pacini Battaglia now under arrest apparently managed his funds through a small Geneva private bank called Banque Karfinco of which he is a director.
Now however there are signs that not only the Italians but also the Swiss are tiring of what has been a mutually convenient arrangement for decades.
Last weekend police in the Italian speaking canton of Ticino confirmed that Mrs Carla Del Ponte the chief prosecutor has been receiving special protection for several months.
She has been particularly vigorous in investigating Mafia cases.
Later this year the Swiss federal government plans to pass a package of tough penal law reforms aimed at preventing criminals everywhere from using Swiss banks.
And leaders of the Swiss financial community are urging the authorities to accelerate appeal procedures behind which suspects have been able to hide for years.
It is not in our interest to slow down the process Mrs Gertrud Erismann of Union Bank of Switzerland says.
UBS is the other Swiss bank that has been publicly linked so far with the political corruption scandals in Italy.
Mr Silvano Larini a close associate of Mr Bettino Craxi the former Italian prime minister opened the so called Protezione account at UBS s Lugano branch in 1979.
Over the subsequent two years Mr Roberto Calvi then president of Banco Ambrosiano paid Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.
9m) into it and it is alleged that Mr Craxi and Mr Claudio Martelli the former justice minister subsequently had access to the account.
UBS was embarrassed by demands from the Geneva police last autumn for information on the account which were accompanied by an insistence that the client not be informed.
UBS felt obliged to appeal on behalf of the client even though it did not want to hinder the investigation.
Geneva police have since allowed the client to be informed and UBS has withdrawn from the appeal.
Switzerland was slow in responding to changing international attitudes to dirty money.
In the early 1980s Bern enraged US authorities by being less than helpful in US demands for help in a few insider trading investigations.
In the late 1980s the country came to be seen as a main centre for drug money laundering especially by the Italian Mafia.
A 1989 federal parliamentary commission accused the public prosecutor of laxity in pursuing narcotics investigations and a book with the cheeky title Switzerland Washes Whiter became a best seller.
As so often though once the Swiss decided to act they moved quickly and effectively.
In August 1990 amendments to the penal code were passed making it an offence for a Swiss banker knowingly to accept money that had been made from criminal activities.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission backed up the new laws by making clear that it would regard the acceptance of dirty money through negligence as a possible contravention of the banking law s stipulation that the conduct of business be above reproach.
Also banks were henceforth obliged to know the real beneficial owners of their accounts.
This tightening has already had a significant impact.
According to one leading Lugano banker any Italian who reveals that he comes from southern Italy stands little chance of opening an account in Switzerland these days.
Swiss bankers point out for example that many of the individuals being named in the current Italian scandal would have been welcomed as clients because of their high standing.
Justice ministry officials say it will make membership in a criminal organisation an offence.
This is particularly significant with respect to the Mafia and the P2 Masonic Lodge.
Switzerland has treaties of mutual assistance on criminal cases with most countries including Italy.
However the Swiss will only co operate with a foreign government if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.
Thus it will become easier for the Italian authorities to pursue Mafia and P2 cases in Switzerland.
The new law will also give Swiss bankers the right if they are suspicious of a client to tell the police without risking prosecution for violating bank secrecy.
This will bring an end to the potential for conflicts of interest that tormented bankers after the 1990 reforms.
The Justice department also intends to set up a specialised office for dealing with organised crime and to establish liaison officers abroad notably in Washington and at Lyons the headquarters of Interpol.
All this does not mean that Swiss banks are going out of the financial haven business.
For Italians or anyone else seeking to avoid tax it is business as usual.
FT 26 MAY 93 Drugs war hits home in Mexico.
Bloody shooting of a cardinal highlights growing problem.
THE killing on Monday of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo of Guadalajara appears to be the latest and for many the most shocking development in Mexico s drugs war.
The Roman Catholic cardinal and six other people died in the airport carpark of Guadalajara Mexico s second city.
Officials said they thought they died in crossfire during a shoot out involving suspected drugs traffickers.
Cardinal Posadas who was 66 had been cardinal in Guadalajara for nearly two years and had previously served as bishop in the cities of Tijuana and Cuernavaca.
Masses in his honour were being held throughout the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country yesterday.
While drug related violence is usually concentrated in a few towns in the north of Mexico where the cartels reside the number of such killings has been increasing and has exposed Mexico to criticism from US drug enforcement authorities who point to official corruption that allows traffickers to flourish.
Between 50 and 70 per cent of US bound cocaine is shipped through Mexico.
In November last year in perhaps the most notorious recent incident at least a dozen men with machine guns shot dead six drug traffickers in a discotheque in Puerto Vallarta a holiday resort on the Pacific coast near Guadalajara.
In January this year a vicious clan war broke out in Culiacan Sinoloa Mexico s drug capital as more than 60 people were murdered in 20 days including eight in a public shoot out in the central square.
On April 11 the drug fight reached the holiday resort of Cancun on the Caribbean coast when six armed menkilled Rafael Aguilar Guajardo a drug trafficker from the cartel of Ciudad Juarez and an American tourist.
On May 1 in what was described as a government triumph the chief of the Guadalajara cartel Emilio Quintero Payan was gunned down by police outside a shopping centre.
The drug problem could yet cause difficulties for Mexico in the run up to the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Until now most of the debate over Nafta has focused on US job losses and Mexico s lax enforcement of environmental and labour laws.
But this week the New York Times gave extensive coverage to a report from a US intelligence officer that warned Mexican drug traffickers were planning to take advantage of lax border controls.
Drug traffickers were planning to purchase trucking and warehouse businesses along the border and had started buying in bond plants as conduits for drug shipments.
Under international and domestic pressure President Carlos Salinas in January this year replaced an ineffective attorney general with Mr Jorge Carpizo former head of the National Human Rights Commission and a man known for his aversion to corruption.
Mr Carpizo soon announced that some 200 anti drug agents (of a total of about 2 000) were being investigated for links to the drug traffickers and issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Guillermo Gonzalez Calderoni former head of the drug investigations in the attorney general s office for inexplicable enrichment.
A judge has also been accused of conspiring with drug traffickers by refusing to issue warrants for arrest of 19 suspected cocaine smugglers.
FT 04 JUN 93 China to act on illegal emigrants.
THE US Coast Guard intercepted two boats trying to smuggle 270 Chinese into California yesterday coinciding with a Chinese government statement that it had stepped up efforts to halt illegal emigration AP reports.
The public security departments have stepped up efforts to track down the criminal groups organising human smuggling and patrols at sea a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Since January authorities on both sides of the Pacific have intercepted boats carrying about 2 500 Chinese each of whom had paid or promised smugglers Dollars 20 000 Dollars 30 000 (Pounds 13 000 Pounds 19 500) to get them into the US illegally.
Many others are entering overland from Mexico or arriving at airports with false documents.
FT 16 JUN 93 Poppies bloom amid Pakistan s economy and politics.
Narcotics make for a black economy half that of the official one.
WHEN drug dealers operating in the Khyber Pass felt threatened by a Pakistani government road building scheme earlier this year they attacked the construction crews with machine guns mortars and a heat seeking missile.
Nine men were killed in the raids which were meant to prevent the government from bringing an all weather road to the remote Tirah Valley the home of poppy fields and scores of heroin laboratories.
Officials have stopped the building work while they try to persuade local village chiefs to guarantee the workmen safe passage.
The tribesmen of the Khyber Pass have never taken kindly to outsiders on their territory as the British colonial rulers discovered a century ago.
But today the weaponry at their disposal enables them to project their power beyond the mountains lying on the Pakistan Afghanistan border.
While the poppies are mostly grown on the Afghan side of the border the profits accrue to dealers who are mainly Pakistanis.
Their fortress like homes dot the road along the Khyber Pass.
The dealers influence reaches into Afghanistan through the guerrilla commanders who need drugs money for buying arms and ammunition.
It also penetrates far into Pakistan distorting the country s economy and politics.
The shock of violent incidents such as the Tirah road attacks the swelling population of drug addicts in Pakistan and strong pressure from the US and other developed countries is at last forcing some officials to admit to the scale of the drug lords influence.
At a recent UN sponsored drug abuse conference in Islamabad delegates from Pakistan concluded.
The massive inflows of money financed by drugs have given birth to a new political situation in Pakistan.
The profits generated from illicit narcotics activity have contributed to a huge black economy half the size of the official one.
Poppies have been grown in Afghanistan for centuries but never in the past on a large scale.
The tribesmen preferred marijuana and heroin was virtually unknown until the advent of war in Afghanistan in 1979.
But in the last decade a region which encompasses eastern Iran Afghanistan and Pakistan has become the world s second largest producer of illegal opium with an estimated 1 115 tonnes last year mostly in Afghanistan according to US government figures.
This is well short of the 2 500 tonnes produced in south east Asia including Burma s Golden Triangle.
But south east Asian output is falling albeit slightly.
This year s crop is estimated to be 20 to 50 per cent higher than 1992 s.
The initial stimulus for increasing output came from a crackdown on opium growing in Middle Eastern countries including Turkey and Iran.
The war in Afghanistan then prompted anti Soviet mujahideen guerrillas to raise production and to invest in heroin laboratories to increase their revenues to buy arms.
The fight against communism was seen as so important that officials in Pakistan from where many mujahideen were supplied turned a blind eye to the proliferation of heroin.
Despite the Soviet withdrawal the mujahideen groups still need money because they are now fighting each other.
Elsewhere in the country peace has permitted farmers to go back into their war ravaged fields.
Mr Habimullah Khan a farmer in eastern Afghanistan says villagers have no choice about growing poppies since they bring ten times as much money as other crops.
Moreover the collapse of the Soviet Union has eased the drug smugglers transport problem.
The traditional route has been south through Pakistan to the port city of Karachi and from there by air and by boat to the rest of the world.
But the borders of the former Soviet republics in central Asia have opened up to trade so trucks laden with legitimate goods such as dried fruit are being used to smuggle heroin into Russia and from Russia into western Europe.
Dealers in the tribal areas lying on the border with Afghanistan dominate the trade.
Under agreements dating back to Pakistan s birth as an independent state in 1947 the government s writ does not run in the tribal areas.
Instead they are administered by tribal chiefs who choose which laws if any they will apply.
Plentiful handouts from the drug dealers ensure that anti narcotics laws are enforced weakly if at all.
Mr Altaf Gauhar editor of the Muslim a leading Pakistani newspaper alleges that almost all the politicians representing the tribal areas in the national assembly in Islamabad are drug smugglers.
A frequent target of such accusations is Mr Haji Ayub Afridi a former truck driver turned millionaire businessman and politician who owns the largest of the forts on the Khyber Pass.
Mr Afridi s house was raided two years ago in the course of a drugs investigation.
But neither then nor later was any evidence found linking him to narcotics smuggling.
A study commissioned by the US Central Intelligence Agency this year found that heroin trading had penetrated the highest political circles in Islamabad and named as a suspected drug smuggler Mr Sohail Zia Butt a brother in law of the prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif.
Alleged dealers are also active at the top of the business community in Karachi.
There are many suspected top drug dealers in investigators files but officials cannot act for lack of firm evidence.
Western anti drugs experts retort that evidence is lacking because of the drug lords political protection.
They are allowed to work behind screens said one.
Mr Ralph Seccombe Pakistan field adviser for the United Nations drug control programme says the whole country is already paying the price for permitting drug dealers to flourish.
FT 01 JUL 93 Mexico acts on wrong arm of the law.
Anti corruption drive in law enforcement agencies.
GOADED by the murder in May of a Roman Catholic cardinal the Mexican government has recently launched a high profile clampdown on corruption in the police force and the attorney general s office.
In two months Mr Jorge Carpizo the respected attorney general has arrested or dismissed scores of high ranking police officers set up an elite anti drug police unit and thrown in jail leaders of the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel.
This came after President Carlos Salinas had vowed the killers of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo would be caught and punished.
The government s moves against corruption are at least partly aimed at satisfying outraged domestic and international opinion.
The murder of the cardinal by presumed drug traffickers sparked a fury unmatched by any other act of violence in Mexico s recent history and threatened to damage the president s domestic standing.
In the US Mexico s attempts to project itself as a modernising progressive country took a battering.
Stories of shoot outs in the country s second largest airport and tunnels dug for drug traffickers between the US and Mexico dominated coverage of the country and fuelled concerns over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But while the anti corruption measures have helped the government regain the initiative after Cardinal Posadas was murdered their effectiveness has been widely questioned.
Corruption is so much a part of Mexico s police force from everyday bribes by motorists to protection money from drug gangs that until now all reforms aimed at weeding it out have failed.
The previous attorney general Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga now ambassador in Paris was once hailed as a moderniser and he too replaced corrupt officials with what was meant to be a new breed of clean lawyers.
Now many of these officials such as Mr Rodrigo Esparza former chief of federal police in the west coast state of Sinaloa have been fired after suspected involvement with drugs.
The centrepiece of the latest initiatives against drug trafficking is the creation of the National Institute to Combat Drugs as an autonomous agency.
Modelled on the US Drug Enforcement Agency the institute will lead investigations of the drug trade arms trafficking and money laundering create an intelligence system and run operations to intercept drug traffickers and shipments.
The Salinas initiative requires an overhaul of the federal anti narcotics squad notorious for corruption.
The institute s charter calls for splitting the anti narcotics police from the attorney general s federal judicial police.
The administration has also arrested 35 people in connection with the shooting of Cardinal Posadas and six others.
Mr Joaqun Guzman Loera apparently the intended target of the attack and head of the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel was seized in Guatemala on June 9 and brought to Mexico.
Later the Mexico City police chief was arrested for his role several years ago in freeing Mr Guzman Loera after the capital s police had captured him.
The attorney general s office (PGR) also announced the dismissal of 67 federal judicial policemen on suspicion of drug related corruption while at least three judges in Sonora state are under investigation for allowing the release of suspected drug traffickers Despite these dramatic steps many are sceptical that they will be sufficient to thwart drug traffickers and their ability to corrupt those who stand in their way.
Mr Robert Bonner head of the DEA in the US warmly applauds Mexico s tough measures but says a thorough clean up would require taking on officials who aid and abet drug trafficking.
We know there are relatives and others who will replace them you have to got to remove totally the infrastructure of the organisation.
Mr Bonner suggests some institutional changes that might cut the incentive to take bribes.
One reform would eliminate the practice of senior police jobs being auctioned off to the highest bidder and another an end to the custom of a madrina a freelance agent who works alongside policemen being paid a commission of goods confiscated in police operations.
Such reforms may be in the making and would be popular with most Mexicans fed up with bribing police and being victimised by gangs who enjoy police protection.
But they would also end a lucrative source of income for government and police officials whose basic salary is low and expectations of wealth high.
FT 28 JUL 93 US tightens immigration curbs.
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a programme to tighten US immigration controls and clamp down on smuggling rings that bring foreigners into the country illegally.
He asked Congress for Dollars 172m to hire up to 600 more border patrol agents and boost efforts to stop immigrant smugglers and intercept smuggling ships at sea.
It s certainly plain to anybody with eyes to see that the border patrol is drastically understaffed breathtakingly understaffed Mr Clinton said.
He also called for a process of expedited exclusion which would allow officials to rule summarily on asylum requests instead of allowing asylum seekers to stay for months while their cases are judged.
Anyone trying to smuggle in aliens would face anti racketeering charges and doubled prison sentences.
In recent months there have been a series of attempts to land illegal immigrants by ship.
The measures have also been prompted by doubts about the effectiveness of US consular officials in screening visa applicants for terrorist links.
There is the recent case of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman a militant Moslem preacher several of whose followers have been arrested in connection with the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York.
Sheikh Omar is in custody awaiting deportation proceedings although he entered the US legally on a visa issued after a CIA review.
Mr Clinton insisted the US was not seeking to close its doors to legal immigrants and would remain the world s greatest melting pot.
However we must say no to illegal immigration so we can continue to say yes to legal immigration he said.
FT 20 SEP 93 Canada s smugglers make a packet.
A look at the growing trade in cut price US cigarettes.
ACTIVITY along the US Canada border is increasingly reminiscent of the rough tough days of Prohibition.
The difference is that the direction of the illicit traffic has been reversed and the product being smuggled is not whisky but cigarettes.
Cross border smuggling has become a huge headache for Canada s tobacco industry and for law enforcement agencies.
According to industry estimates almost one in five cartons of cigarettes sold in Canada has been smuggled across the border.
Retailers in Quebec where the problem is at its worst say they are losing more than half their business to smugglers.
The surge in cigarette smuggling can be traced to the sin taxes imposed on tobacco.
In most provinces smokers pay four different federal and provincial taxes.
This means a pack of 20 cigarettes costing about CDollars 6.
15 in a US store over the border in Buffalo New York.
Official figures show that domestic cigarette sales fell 26 per cent in July compared to a year earlier.
But as Mr Jacques LaRiviere vice president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council points out.
The consumer has been looking for alternatives and where there is demand there develops supply.
Many of the smuggled cigarettes meeting that demand are made in Canada because Canadian smokers tend to prefer Canadian brands which use pure Virginia tobacco.
Canadian cigarettes sold to some US wholesalers are being resold to organised crime syndicates which then transport them back across the border in small boats or under the false floors of cars and trucks.
As a result while domestic sales have been shrinking exports have surged by 88 per cent to 9.
7bn cigarettes in the first seven months of this year.
Once back in Canada the cigarettes are sold tax free in bars shopping mall parking lots and schools.
Prominent labels on exported cigarette packs which warn that the contents are not for sale in Canada have failed to stop the trade.
Manufacturers report that a growing proportion of smuggled cigarettes come in packs that are almost identical to those produced for the domestic market.
Greater vigilance by police and customs officials at border crossings has been ineffective.
Enforcement is complicated by the fact that much of the traffic is channelled through Indian reserves which straddle the border and whose inhabitants claim that outside authorities have no right to interfere.
Some in the industry say the best and perhaps the only way to stop the illicit traffic would be to lighten the tax burden on tobacco.
Hefty taxes on cigarettes are designed to discourage smoking as well as providing revenues to the government.
But as the cross border bootleggers proved 70 years ago smokers and drinkers will not easily let politicians deprive them of their pleasures.
US tries to break the vicious circle Latest efforts to stem the tide of illegal drugs.
FOR the US government the war against drugs begins overseas.
But if its measure of success is the quantity of narcotics flowing into the country then it has failed.
The simple fact of the matter is that after spending billions of dollars on the interdiction effort more cocaine and more heroin enters the country today than before the first drug strategy was released in 1989 a congressional report concluded last month.
This sense of failure led the Clinton administration to announce a shift in strategy last month.
But the shift which reduces the emphasis on interdiction and aims to increase US spending in the source countries has disappointed most followers of the drugs issue.
This is just another stage of the cycle of the international drugs war said Mr Kevin Zeese of the reform oriented Drugs Policy Foundation.
It s a good thing they ve recognised the failure of interdiction but they are chasing the cat s tail.
Nixon focuses on interdiction Carter on eradication Reagan and Bush go back to military spending and interdiction then Clinton focuses again on the source countries.
The Clinton administration has tried to frame its anti narcotics strategy overseas within its foreign policy emphasis on democracy and human rights.
Counter narcotics is an integral part of what we are trying to do with foreign policy said Mr Richard Porter director of national security affairs in the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Trafficking corruption drug use economic dislocation instability and human rights problems are more likely when democratic institutions are fragile which is why the traffickers are there.
Interdiction involving coastguard and naval operations and AWACS aerial surveillance mainly in the Caribbean has been expensive.
The Pentagon which controls these operations has been criticised for wasting millions of tax dollars and for diverting non drug enforcement activities to drug enforcement accounts.
Yet officials insist these efforts have had a significant impact on the Colombian cartels which dominate the cocaine trade and are moving into the heroin business.
It s a matter of looking as the dollars get scarcer at where we can get more bang for the buck.
The efforts have increased interceptions which have forced significant changes in the cartels methods he said.
Seizures amounting to 107 tonnes in the three years from 1989 to 1992 have cost the cartels billions of dollars.
Furthermore instead of transporting the cocaine in bulk through Florida as was common a few years ago they are now forced to make smaller shipments.
But there would be greater cost effectiveness if the traffickers were tackled in source countries.
If we want the bees the best place to get them is in the hive.
Otherwise we are chasing them all over the forest where they are harder and harder to find Mr Porter said.
Yet drugs policy experts are worried that such a shift would merely move funds from one part of the Defence Department to another.
Meanwhile despite the administration s emphasis on building democracy this part of the strategy would be viewed as foreign aid and therefore highly vulnerable to cuts by Congress.
Furthermore the attempt to identify a successful drugs policy with democracy is likely to be confusing.
It s a recipe for ineffective policy says Mr Peter Hakim of the Washington based InterAmerican Dialogue.
Though there is criticism of the drugs policy for placing too much emphasis overseas only 9 per cent of the Dollars 12.
7bn budget in 1993 was spent outside the US and less than 4 per cent was spent in joint programmes with other governments the majority of which was in the Andean countries.
The new efforts say officials would build on improved co operation already evident particularly with Bolivia and Colombia in the Andes.
A senior State Department official said these efforts would aim to provide increased help with the administration of justice.
Help with eradication would continue but there would be greater emphasis on alternative development and crop substitution.
The US would also seek support in these objectives from the international financial institutions.
But these objectives are difficult and succeed if at all only in the long term.
Furthermore eradication efforts as has been shown in the Latin American centre for coca production in Peru s Upper Huallaga Valley have only succeeded in shifting production elsewhere.
Alternative crops such as cocoa coffee and palm oil occasionally fetch higher prices on the international market to make them competitive with coca.
But drugs dealers can always raise the prices they are prepared to pay for coca leaf to levels which keep coca growers hooked.
The difference between the price of cocaine on the other side of the border and the price on the US side means that efforts to stem supply almost inevitably looked doomed to failure.
THE MAIN TRADE ROUTES Where cocaine and opiates come from and where they go United States Cocaine market worth Dollars 15bn Dollars 17.

FT 27 JAN 94 Smugglers force Canada to cut cigarette taxes.
Canada s federal and Quebec governments have bowed to the commercial and political costs of rampant cigarette smuggling across the US Canada border and look set to reverse a tradition of ever higher taxation on tobacco products.
Both Quebec and Ottawa have promised to cut and perhaps even abolish the high federal and provincial taxes which are widely blamed for the surge in cigarette smuggling.
The problem is most acute in Quebec where the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council estimates that about two thirds of all cigarette sales are contraband.
A group of Quebec convenience store owners whose business has been ravaged by smuggling earlier this week flouted the law by setting up an illegal market north of Montreal where they sold cigarettes at the smuggled price of CDollars 20 (Pounds 10.
20) a carton compared with the fully taxed retail price of CDollars 40 CDollars 46.
Governments have become increasingly concerned at the social and political ramifications of smuggling.
Much of the trade which is centred on the St Lawrence River and Indian reserves which straddle the US Canada border has fallen into the hands of organised crime.
Some Indian communities have begun to manufacture their own cigarettes and contraband products are starting to find their way on to retailers shelves in counterfeit packaging.
The ready availability of cheap smuggled cigarettes is also believed to have boosted consumption.
Contraband packs carry less prominent health warnings.
Ottawa and the provinces have so far failed to agree on a co ordinated tax cut.
Ontario which collects CDollars 800m a year from tobacco taxes and is struggling to contain a yawning budget deficit is reluctant to forfeit a sizeable source of revenue.
But the smuggling issue has gained a political dimension in Quebec where separatists argue that the francophone province could easily put a stop to the trade if it had greater autonomy from Ottawa.
Tobacco manufacturers estimate that taxes on cigarettes will have to be chopped by about two thirds to compete with contraband goods.
They are also banking on a rise in US cigarette taxes within the next year to narrow the price gap between the two countries.
FT 09 FEB 94 Canadian tobacco taxes cut sharply.
Canada yesterday sharply cut tobacco taxes in the hope of curbing the growth in cigarette smuggling across its border with the US.
But the government balanced excise tax cuts with measures to avert a backlash from anti smoking groups including a new health promotion surtax on cigarette makers profits and a promise of tighter curbs on the sale and promotion of tobacco products.
The cross border smuggling boom has its origins in high excise taxes which have pushed retail cigarette prices up to about CDollars 45 (Pounds 23) a carton in Canada almost double the US level.
The problem is most acute in Quebec where contraband products now account for an estimated two thirds of total cigarette consumption.
Social and political concerns have put pressure on the government to clamp down.
Much of the traffic has fallen into the hands of organised crime.
Tensions have grown between law enforcement authorities and Indian reserves which straddle the border and are a favourite route for contraband.
In addition Quebec separatists have sought to portray the smuggling issue as an example of the francophone province s interests being ignored by the rest of the country.
The measures announced yesterday include a CDollars 5 tax cut per carton of cigarettes bringing federal taxes down to CDollars 11 a carton.
Provinces willing to cut their taxes by more than CDollars 5 will have the cuts matched by the federal government.
The three year surtax on tobacco companies is expected to raise about CDollars 200m.
Ottawa will levy an export tax of CDollars 8 per carton to reflect the fact that most of the smuggled cigarettes originate in Canada.
FT 07 MAR 94 African task force to combat wildlife traffickers.
Law enforcement officers from nine African countries are meeting in Nairobi this week to create a regional task force to fight international crime syndicates dealing in ivory rhino horn diamonds arms and drugs.
We need a highly mobile team of officers with the authority to operate across borders to penetrate.
increasingly sophisticated smuggling networks says Lt Col Pieter Lategan of the South African police force s Endangered Species Protection Unit.
With an African task force we could place wildlife traffickers under surveillance as they move across borders so that entire networks and not just individuals could be apprehended he said.
Trafficking in wildlife is on the rise and has become linked to illegal trade in weapons and drugs across southern and eastern Africa.
Mr Lategan s unit impounded 2 200 tusks last year hacked into 22 000 cubes to facilitate smuggling compared with 130 tusks in 1992.
Kenya seized more than 1 000 kg of ivory in 1993 in a case involving five Koreans and one Ethiopian smuggler.
Officials from Kenya s Wildlife Service who have won plaudits worldwide for their anti poaching efforts say they need freedom to cross borders when pursuing poachers and smugglers.
They would also welcome extradition treaties to trap ring leaders of international networks.
Zambia arrested 1 500 poachers in 1993 and seized more than 2 000 automatic weapons.
Uganda is concerned with the growing trade in chimpanzees and rare birds.
Swaziland says it has lost 60 per cent of its white rhino population since poachers invaded the landlocked kingdom in 1988.
Hardened criminals are what we are often up against says a Swazi police officer.
They deal not only in poaching but in gun running drugs grand larceny and murder.
Mozambique which is emerging from a 17 year civil war has become a free for all for poaching gangs including foreign armed forces who regularly invade Mozambique from neighbouring countries.
According to the law enforcement officers at the Nairobi conference it is known that Zambians and Malawians hunt elephants in Tete province while Tanzanians and Somalis operate along the Rovuma river in northern Mozambique.
Officers believe an African Task Force would give them more power to address corruption within their own customs police and armed forces.
The delegates from Kenya Lesotho Malawi Mozambique South Africa Swaziland Uganda Tanzania and Zambia hope the anti smuggling task force will be operational in 12 months.
FT 17 MAR 94 Foreign gangs rule organised crime.
There is no single UK gang dominant in organised crime the Commons home affairs committee was told yesterday.
Home Office and Customs and Excise officials told the committee that leaving Northern Ireland aside hundreds of crime syndicates were involved in everything from extortion and lorry hijacking to drugs.
But there was no dominant group like the Mafia in Italy.
The main operators in the UK were often tentacles of international syndicates like the Mafia the Triads and the Colombian cartels.
These groups increasingly joined by gangs from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are often involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.
Estimating the extent of organised crime is hampered by the lack of a broad definition in UK law of organised crime such as that in the US law against racketeering.
Officials defined organised crime as a group activity whose prime purpose is the achievement of large scale profits through criminal acts which is long term and continuing and includes some form of self perpetuating criminal structure.
5bn and Pounds 4bn was laundered in the UK in 1992.
Customs and Excise officials estimated that in the year to April 1993 the value of drugs prevented from entering the UK was Pounds 896m.
FT 28 JUN 94 Arrest of bank executives renews Ecuador drugs fears.
Ecuador has been the one Andean country to enjoy relative immunity from the attention of drugs traffickers.
But the arrest last week of top executives of the Banco de los Andes on money laundering charges has renewed concern that the country is becoming a centre for drug traffickers seeking to legitimise profits.
Police assert that the bank s general manager retired rear admiral Guillermo Duenas as well as other executives were involved in laundering money from the infamous Ecuadorean drug traffickers Reyes Magos.
Four executives have been arrested and arrest warrants have been issued for 11 others.
Funds were allegedly laundered in the Banco de los Andes a medium sized retail bank and its offshore operations in the Caribbean as well as in the military owned Banco Ruminahui.
The allegations are the second stage of a case first uncovered in December 1992 which has already led to the dismissal of the general manager of Banco Ruminahui and the subsequent capture of gang leader Jorge Hugo Reyes.
As a former military official Duenas is likely to face trial before the country s supreme court.
In their defence bank officials said the allegations covered no cash but only cheques and money transfers from renowned international banks including Swiss Bank Corporation Dresdner Bank New York Deutsche Bank Citibank International Bayerische Vereinsbank and Brown Brothers Harriman.
Despite continuing uncertainty about the extent of the scandal investors and traders in the financial markets have remained calm.
The superintendent of banks Ricardo Munoz assured the 170 000 customers of the Banco de los Andes that the bank s liquidity was not affected by the arrests.
Accounts in Ecuador the US and Europe allegedly containing drugs funds and the personal assets of the accused bank officials have been frozen for some time.
A recent agreement between the US and Ecuador allows confiscated assets to be redistributed between the two countries.
Yet the latest scandal raises questions about controls within Ecuador s financial system.
Situated between Latin America s largest drug producing and exporting countries Peru and Colombia respectively international observers fear Ecuador could turn into a money laundering haven for drug dealers.
Government officials insist that the existing legal framework is sufficient to control money laundering.
Mr Jose Iturralde Arteaga an official at the Superintendency of Banks says.
The problem is not that we don t have adequate laws and regulations rather it is a lack of enforcement that permits money laundering in the country.
He adds that the recently approved financial sector law grants the police authority to search suspect financial institutions and confiscate confidential documents.
Yet critics say drug money enters the country unchecked through any number of illegal channels.
Offshore banking operations artisan gold trade and falsified export import invoicing are some of the most common ways to launder money besides cash purchases.
Mr Alberto Acosta an economic analyst estimates the amount of money laundered in Ecuador to be around Dollars 400m annually.
Only the flow of narco dollars can explain the great consumption of luxury goods in a country in recession he says.
FT 04 JUL 94 FBI takes anti Mafia doctrine to Russia.
Mr Louis Freeh the FBI director who arrived in Moscow yesterday as part of a central and East european tour said the mounting crime wave in Russia posed common threats to all.
In an interview with NBC television he repeated a warning first made in the US that there was a threat of large scale theft of nuclear materials inside Russia.
Mr Freeh who today opens the FBI s first office in Moscow was challenged over a suggestion by Russia s counter intelligence chief Mr Sergei Stepashin that he had no firm evidence to support these fears.
Mr Freeh who is to meet Mr Stepashin conceded no significant cases had yet come to light but he cited the finding of some enriched weapons grade uranium in Stuttgart Germany as indicative of a very serious threat.
Mr Freeh arrived in Moscow from Kiev where he signed a communique on co operation between the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine and the US.
Mr Freeh said Ukraine was becoming a main transit zone from Asia to western Europe in the multi billion dollar international drugs trade.
There is concern that what we call in international narcotics enforcement the Balkan route from Turkey Bulgaria Austria to the west may be moving north and using Ukraine as a transit point Mr Freeh said.
Russia s deputy interior minister Mr Mikhail Yegorov who met Mr Freeh at the airport said last month that the Mafia had declared war on the state.
His ministry registered five crime related bombings a day while the number of kidnappings in Moscow alone had soared to 118 in the first six months of this year from 16 in 1993.
President Boris Yeltsin has ordered a crackdown against Mafia style gangs.
Yet Mr Yeltsin s decree which gives police greater powers to hold suspects and to investigate bank accounts was highly controversial.
Parliament s lower house said it violated the constitution.
Mr Freeh made it clear that he saw the burgeoning organised crime wave in Russia as being as much a threat to the US and the west as to Russia itself.
He cited the recent example of Russian organised gangs working with the Italian Mafia to funnel a big drug consignment into the US.
and not do what we did with respect to Italian organised crime and that was wait for 50 years before we got involved Mr Freeh said.
The director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation Mr Louis Freeh yesterday opened a representative office in Moscow and appealed to the Russian authorities to combat crime before it overwhelmed them.
Mr Freeh told an audience of interior ministry police officers that Russian organised crime represented a threat to world security.
The FBI chief on a 10 day tour of eastern Europe told a packed hall at the interior ministry police academy that the fact that Russian crime groups could use their existing and expanding criminal networks to exploit weapons grade radioactive materials is sufficient to warrant international concern and action.
Though his speech was a model of diplomatic balance he stressed the many mistakes made by US law enforcement agencies in the original response to the growth of organised crime which permitted the expansion of a powerful well organised crime syndicate.
However he stressed the need to tackle urgently the Russian problem now being internationalised.
of a catastrophic attack by criminals armed with nuclear weapons Mr Freeh stressed.
The potential of crime gangs to ultimately retard Russia s economic development and precipitate the flight of legitimate capital.
The ability of the gangs to launder money from Russia through banks in the US a potentially corrupting influence on the banking industries in Russia and the US.
The threat posed to the Russian state by the growing and ruthless power of the gangs.
Quoting President Boris Yeltsin Mr Freeh said that organised crime is trying to take the country by the throat.
The use of Russia as a transhipment point for drug traffic especially by the Colombian drug cartels.
However Mr Freeh insisted that the law enforcement response to this criminal threat must be consistent with the fundamental principles of justice.
Italian police yesterday said they had broken up a criminal organisation based in Bari capable of smuggling up to 5 000 illegal immigrants a month into the country via the coastline of the Puglia region on the Adriatic coast.
This is the largest immigration ring uncovered and highlights the involvement of organised crime in this increasingly profitable business.
More than 20 people were arrested including Italian nationals Slavs and North Africans.
In addition to being charged with bringing people illegally into Italy they were accused of organising prostitution and providing false documentation.
The Italian authorities are showing increasing concern over the import of prostitutes.
Prostitution has been one of the main activities unaffected by the two year long recession.
But with the economy beginning to recover the authorities are also anxious to cut off a new flow of hopeful job seekers.
During the summer more than 200 Albanians a week are believed to have entered the country illegally via the Puglian coast.

Global mafia pact The end of history is beginning to look ugly International crime.
CRIME WITHOUT FRONTIERS By Claire Sterling Little Brown Pounds 18.
99 274 pages Everyone has heard of the growth of crime in eastern Europe since the demise of communism.
Terms such as the Wild East and Mafioski punctuate newspaper reports of flourishing black markets and a profiteering old guard.
this is the difficult transitional period leading to unfettered capital markets and private enterprise.
Now that Russia is the west s friend it is the end of history a phrase coined in 1990 which still has currency today.
Three years later the end of history is beginning to look decidely ugly but it is organised not chaotic.
A prostrate country lies open to the international underworld which sets about constructing the world s biggest criminal safehouse.
Crime syndicates have bought up Russia s governing class looted its natural resources manipulated its currency and infiltrated every sector of its economy.
Russia has become a giant washing machine swapping narcodollars for roubles a toll gate for Europe s drug trade.
Crime Without Frontiers is the story of how western and eastern criminal syndicates secured the former Soviet safehouse the last piece in constructing a global pax mafiosa.
The safehouse is the size of Europe and America combined a point de rencontre from which to carve the planet into orderly spheres of corruption.
In the pax mafiosa business is business the Chinese Triads are partners in crime with the American Mafia.
the Italians use the Russians to launder for the Colombian cartels the Japanese Yakuza work hand in hand with the Italians.
Where there was once legitimate East West distrust there is now criminal detente.
On one hand are sensible crooks working in dishonest harmony on the other is lawful society haggling over legal jurisdiction and perpetuating a multitude of police agencies carefully keeping secrets from each other.
The use of Germany as a criminal transit point between east and west is the book s most startling case in point a paradigm of the European Union s vulnerability to the forces of enterprise crime.
Germany is a victim of its own punctilious laws of privacy and data protection.
phone taps and bugging are outlawed there is no cross fertilisation between law enforcement agencies and anti money laundering legislation is effectively unworkable.
Sterling describes it as an epic joke where crime fighting is concerned.
No two countries have the same drug laws or surveillance of pushers.
There is no pooling of police information and no common extradition policy.
The EU cannot even agree on harmonising police radio frequencies.
In this environment criminals choose the best countries to ship store market and launder their produce.
Sterling s book is nothing short of remarkable in its intuitive knowledge of the workings of a new underworld order only glimpsed by the media.
It explains the horrifying flipside to the freedom of movement so cherished since the almost concurrent fall of communism and the dismantling of Europe s internal barriers.
Unfortunately few have listened carefully to this flipside.
Sterling says that by the time the Western powers that be listen hard enough they may already have become the powers that were.
They will be dealing with an international shadow government the likes of which has never been seen or imagined.
The faceless crime boss who is all too real This well educated well spoken cosmopolitan businessman is laughing all the way to the bank.
While officials and ministers from more than 120 countries meet today in Naples at the start of a UN conference on organised international crime many a big time crook will be laughing all the way to the bank.
As Liliano Ferraro a senior official with Italy s ministry of justice commented last week.
The organised crime syndicates have already held this kind of meeting.
they just meet in a hotel in eastern Europe and divide the profits.
It has taken the Italians more than five years to generate sufficient interest among UN member states even to talk about the subject.
Attempts at improving international co operation on law enforcement remain hampered by a combination of political rivalries jealously guarded national legal systems official corruption and rank inefficiency.
In contrast the organised international criminal fraternity has become increasingly sophisticated.
it is adept at extending its operations across frontiers establishing areas of common interest and manipulating the world s economic system for hugely lucrative ends.
International organised criminals have learnt to outwit law enforcement agencies says James Wyburd an investigator with MRC Business Information Group.
In the words of John Kerry a US senator these global mobsters cause so much trouble that they are the new communism the new monolithic threat.
The really big boys are pretty far removed from his tory s and Hollywood s gangster self publicist.
Alphonse Capone better known as Al the man whom the American crime writer Jay Robert Nash describes as a near illiterate who acquired millions and knew not where to spend a dime of it.
Eduardo Vetere a former professor in law who heads the UN s anti crime branch based in Vienna says.
Today s big time criminals are more serious and dangerous than Capone ever was.
The world has become smaller while the criminals have become bigger.
It s a global village in which crime in one country is easily transferred to others.
There is no one better to ask about old and new time crooks than Mike Cherkasky.
An employee of Kroll Associates one of the world s leading private corporate spook agencies Cherkasky is a former New York attorney s investigator who helped convict John Gotti boss of the American mafia in 1992 and was a prominent investigator in the BCCI case.
Cherkasky now helps supervise one of New York s garbage collection services once the preserve of the mob.
The mob blue collar criminals like Gotti may have worn Armani suits and cashmere coats but they used their fists to get to the top he says.
He is a cosmopolitan businessman well educated well spoken who knows how to move among politicians and transfer his money from Wall Street to London to Paris and onwards if he wants to.
He has plenty of opportunities but greed makes him take the criminal route.
The world s leading organised criminals do not give interviews bragging about their activities as Capone did daily to the Chicago press.
The meanest use journalists for target practice if they get anywhere near.
Behind today s organised criminal lies a veritable machine of hardware and hard men which makes Capone s hoods look like chocolate soldiers.
Perhaps the most colourful prototype of the new international gangster was Pablo Escobar a collector of giraffes camels beautiful women and classic cars including Capone s Pontiac.
Colombia s drug baron turned the smuggling of cocaine into the world s biggest money spinning bootleg operation.
His ability to bribe and corrupt officials went far beyond his home town of Medellin where he is believed to have authorised payments of Dollars 1m per day to keep himself out of jail.
Escobar had a private army of 1 000 armed with state of the art military hardware and an A team of lawyers well versed in the art of laundering his ill gotten gains through the world s (mainly off shore) financial centres.
Escobar was shot dead almost a year ago by the Colombian army supported by the CIA the US air force and the US drug enforcement agency.
Yet he might have escaped had it not been for rival drug barons turning against him.
Next to the Colombian boys it is the emerging criminal fraternity in eastern Europe which is likely to cause most worry at this week s conference.
In a background paper to the conference the UN s anti crime division does not mince words when it comes to the new Russian mafia.
Roubles as well as smuggled arms and valuable metals worth billions of dollars leave the country in an unregulated fashion each month while there is a substantial inflow of black and grey money the anti crime squad states.
The criminal fraternity includes blue collar villains not so different from the one time Chicago mobsters.
But at his most sophisticated the eastern European criminal bribes officials terrorises western businessman manipulates the banking system launders money around the west with front companies and exchange control fiddles and engages in such transnational activities as prostitution drugs smuggling and arms trading.
Only last week a nuclear power plant was temporarily shut in Lithuania because of terrorist threats.
The Naples conference is a gesture fitting in a city of magic and death.
An investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration cracked a money laundering network and found links between the Mafia and Colombia s Cali cartel.
The probe led to the seizure of nine tons of cocaine and Dollars 52m (Pounds 33m) in cash and the arrest of 88 people.
