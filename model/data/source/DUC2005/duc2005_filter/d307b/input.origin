19910424000000000	FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (14): Where the papers come three days late  -Wuhan is China's natural crossroads, but is cut off by poor communications. IF WUHAN, the capital of Hubei province, is set to become one of China's main communications hubs - as local officials claim, and a glimpse at any map would endorse - how is it that Peking newspapers take three or four days to arrive? 'We are the Chicago of the Orient,' Zhao Baojiang, the mayor of Wuhan, claims in a grand hyperbolic sweep. Wuhan is also at a critical midpoint on the Yangtze river, and sits abreast China's main north-south railway, linking Hong Kong and Guangdong in the south with Peking and the land-bridge to Europe in the north. In a country with normal communications, Wuhan's pivotal location would project it to the commercial and industrial centre-stage. Peking papers would be available on the day of publication. But in China, it stands as a monument to the awful impoverishment of the nation's communications. The city's time may indeed come. But it will take considerable improvements in the national transport infrastructure to transform its prospects. It will also require the creation in China of a true national market. At present, a labyrinth of bureaucratic obstacles to trade across provincial boundaries - which amount to nothing less than provincial protectionism - make Wuhan's central location in China a commercial irrelevance. This perhaps explains why Hubei province has slipped in the past five years from China's ninth most important exporter to its 13th. It also explains why a province that is among the best endowed in China in terms of agricultural and mineral resources, and in terms of industrial and commercial capacity, has failed to make a more powerful mark among the country's magnets for foreign investment. Hubei's endowments are prolific: the Jianghan plain which straddles the Yangtze in the heart of the province is among the most fertile in China. Its red alluvial soils grow about one fifth of the country's cotton and makes Hubei China's fifth largest grain producer. Lakes spread across the south of the province - some of them more like inland seas - provide a living for almost a quarter of a million fish farmers, and underpin an industry in aquatic products that ranks third in China. These together make Hubei one of China's leading textile manufacturers and a leader in food processing. Rich supplies of iron, copper and an array of rarer minerals mainly in the east of the province around Huangshi supply one of China's largest steel complexes and a leading special steels manufacturer. These in turn underpin the country's second largest automotive manufacturer, in Shiyan in Hubei's north-west. A combination of these resource-riches, and Hubei's pivotal location at the heart of China, make it clear that few provinces would stand to gain so much from the dismantling of centralised controls over China's economy, and the loosening of the domestic market. Local officials may not yet be fully aware of the riches liberalisation can bring but in the meanwhile are committed to infrastructural improvements over the decade ahead that will be of significant help when the virtues of Hubei's prime location at the heart of China's market are allowed to come into play. A new RMB Yuan 600m international airport will be opening in 1993. A second Yangtze road bridge joining Hankou and Wuchang will enhance north-south communications in the province and ease traffic congestion in Wuhan itself. Railway electrification is planned. A new 50,000-line telephone exchange is being installed. Massive investment in both thermal and hydro power stations is being made. Economic zones are being established in Wuhan and in Yichang and Huangshi along the banks of the Yangtze. They are intended to capitalise on the creation of Shanghai's Pudong special economic zone over the coming decade. This development underlies one of the most exciting changes now underway: the re-establishment of the Yangtze, after half a century of neglect, as a critically important commercial artery in central China. A new foreign trade port is under construction, a companion to Baihushan completed just east of Wuhan six years ago. New local shippers like Datong and Qingchuan are vying with former state monopolies and the fast-growing private shipper, Minsheng, to provide competitive services along the length of the Yangtze for the first time since 1949. While Hubei has until recently had only modest success in attracting foreign investment, lagging in particular behind coastal provinces, recent deals provide encouraging signs. A joint venture with Citroen, agreed last year, will lead to the production of 300,000 cars a year in Wuhan and Shiyan, further enhancing the province's importance as a supplier to the national automobile market. An optical fibre plant, to be built with help from Philips, will also be important in enhancing China's domestic telecommunications capacity. Foreign capital used for new equipment at the Wuhan Iron and Steel works is intended to boost annual output from 5m tonnes of rolled steel to 7m tonnes by the year 2000, boosting the company's role as one of China's four main suppliers of high-quality steel. If approval is given to the environmentally controversial Sanxia hydroelectric project, which would be built across the Yangtze in the Three Gorges on Hubei's western border with Sichuan, Hubei would become a critical supplier of power to all of central China. The 13,000MW generated by Sanxia would dwarf the recently-completed Gezhouba dam in Yichang, which generates 2,700MW and is already a critically important supplier to the Yangtze region. All these developments point to Wuhan's preparedness for the larger role which would result from the creation of a nationwide market economy. Local leaders pay lip service to the need for less central control of the economy and more market freedoms. But behind the brave rhetoric, the provincial authorities are not yet willing to end subsidies to bankrupt factories. In Wuhan, the leadership appears to have taken the first significant steps towards unleashing market forces, and lifting the burden of company subsidies from the shoulders of the government. Mayor Zhao Baojiang, who estimates that one in 10 Wuhan workers is employed in a loss-making factory, says: 'We are asking workers to move into the individual enterprise sector if their factory is a 'losing money factory'.' Chinese historians say that Wuhan has often been fortunate - but only in unfortunate times. With the ground now being well laid, a significant opening up of China's economy to market forces could bring fortune in fortunate times. Yet Wuhan would still have a long haul to become Mayor Zhao's 'Chicago of the Orient'.
19910424000000000	FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (16): Revival of a 70 year-old dream - Plan to dam the mighty Yangtse stirs environmental fears. ONE of the most beautiful and romantic stretches of water in the world is the Yangtse river where it flows through three massive gorges below Chongqing, in the south-west province of Sichuan. The misty cliffs which overhang it have figured in many a famous Chinese painting and the trees and wild life up the side valleys are increasingly precious in a country near-devastated by industrial pollution. The Yangtse, or Changjiang, as the Chinese call it, is the third longest river in the world with a mean annual runoff of 9.8bn cubic metres. Flooding is a perennial threat to the tens of millions who live downstream, and in a country short of energy its waters are keenly viewed as a source of hydropower. In 1923, Sun Yat Sen, China's first president, proposed a huge dam across the lowest gorge to control the floods. Since then the project has been endlessly debated and researched by politicians, engineers and hydro-electric specialists. The scheme surfaced again last year, though subject to further approval by the rubber-stamp National People's Congress. Now Han Hongshu, vice-governor of Hubei province, speaks as if work is about to begin. Hubei has already done well out of the Gezhouba dam at Yichang, downstream of the gorges, which created new jobs and now provides power. In Sichuan, they are not so sure: 'Of course the central government must decide, but we here think it would be better to spend the money on dams and hydropower projects upstream on the Yangtse tributaries", says Ma Lin, the Vice-governor. Advocates of the dam point to the reduction in flood risks, the 18bn units of electricity a year that the scheme would generate and the improved navigability of the river, enabling ocean-going ships to reach Chongqing. The Ministry of Water Resources and Power set up a committee of 412 experts, of whom more than 400 supported it, while a detailed Canadian feasibility study also found in favour. Opponents stress the enormous cost (yuan 36 bn), the number of people to be resettled (a million or so), the risk of earthquake or (in the event of a war) bomb damage and unpredictable environmental consequences. They also point to illogicalities in the concept: for power generation the reservoir upstream must be full, for flood retention empty. In 1989, the year of the Tiananmen demonstrations, the dam became a political issue. A group of writers led by Dai Qing, later put under house arrest as a dissident, published a book opposing it as a 'Stalinist folly'. They accused Li Peng, the premier, a Moscow-trained electrical engineer (and a one-time head of the ministry in charge of hydro-power) of trying to bolster his own prestige by linking his name with a project once favoured by Chairman Mao. These intellectuals are silenced now, but the questions remain. Where will the resettled population go? ('Further up the mountains' said Ministry of Water Resources officials). Could silting gradually fill the 500 km reservoir behind the dam, leaving Chongqing literally high and dry? Wouldn't it be better for Peking to spend the money on installing equipment nationwide to save electricity rather than providing more? One look at China shows how little care is given to the environment. The builders of the Gezhouba dam seem not to have known of the existence of the Yangtse sturgeon (now proudly displayed at the Yichang breeding station ) until they bumped their noses on the new barrier going upstream to spawn. It seems unlikely enough research has been done on river and marine life, climatic consequences, loss of land fertility or the greater scouring effects caused by a less silt-burdened river. While China seems unlikely on grounds of cost to build the dam in the near future, it remains a threat as long as a totalitarian government in Peking can in the last resort overrule opposition.
19920109000000000	FT  09 JAN 92 / Protest over Kenya deal with UK firm: World Bank attacks cost of contract for proposed hydroelectric scheme as 'exorbitant'. THE WORLD Bank has laun-ched a strong attack on a Pounds 38.1m contract, backed by the UK government, involving a British firm of consulting engineers and a Kenyan state company. The British firm, Knight Piesold and Partners, signed the contract in July 1990 with the Kenya Power and Lighting Corporation (KPLC) for consultancy services on the proposed Ewaso Ngiro hydroelectric scheme. In an internal document, the World Bank says the price of the contract for consultancy services is 'five times what such services would normally cost'. A World Bank official in Washington confirmed the authenticity of the document but would not comment further. KPLC is a state owned company under the Ministry of Energy. The ministry is tarnished by allegations of corruption during the nine year tenure of Mr Nicholas Biwott, the disgraced former minister who held the energy portfolio until November last year. No such allegations are made against the British company. Last night the company denied the consultancy fee was excessive in relation to the likely, final cost of the project. Mr Biwott was sacked from the cabinet after allegations at a public inquiry that he had received financial kickbacks from a Swiss consultancy firm and that he was a prime suspect in the murder in February 1990 of Dr Robert Ouko, the former foreign minister. He was arrested in connection with the murder but later released after the police said they could not find enough evidence to charge him. Western officials also question the role of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), which is understood to have guaranteed 85 per cent of the loan. A spokesman for ECGD in London refused to confirm that a credit has been arranged for the project, but western diplomats and bankers close to the project insist that the guarantee has been approved. The Department of Trade and Industry declined to comment. According to the World Bank document, at least Dollars 28m (Pounds 15.3m) has already been paid up front to Knight Piesold for a feasibility study - including site investigation - on the hydroelectric scheme, which is not due to come on stream for at least another decade. The British company says the project will be completed earlier. Western economists believe that a further payment of Dollars 16m will have to be paid on presentation of the study by the middle of this year. 'The exorbitant cost of this contract together with the high level of upfront payments . . . even before the feasibility study has been completed, raises fundamental questions about procurement practices and financial management,' says the document, drawn up after a special mission to Kenya last November by the International Development Association, the soft loan arm of the World Bank. Knight Piesold says the scheme involves the multi-purpose development of the Ewaso Ngiro river and includes three separate hydroelectric projects, a river transfer scheme and an irrigation project. 'At about 12 per cent of the total estimated cost (of the completed project cost), the consultancy fee is entirely in line with the norm for work of this nature.' It adds: 'Within the sum are a number of significant items not related to consultancy, such as site investigation, survey, environmental impact studies, financing charges and the construction of access roads - all of these being essentially front-end costs.'
19920321000000000	FT  21 MAR 92 / Mexico puts controversial dam on hold. THE Mexican government has dropped plans to build a hydroelectric dam on the Rio Usumacinta, near the Guatemalan border. The dam, which is opposed by environmentalists, would not be built during the administration of President Carlos Salinas, the federal commission for electricity said. However, the commission left open the possibility of the dam being constructed under the next administration, which begins on December 1 in 1994. Environmentalists said the dam's construction might flood some of the nearby Mayan cities, and upset the delicate ecological balance in the Lacandona tropical rainforest.
19920313000000000	FT  13 MAR 92 / Mexico's proposal for dam upsets environmentalists. THE Mexican government is planning to build a hydroelectric dam on the river bordering the Guatemalan frontier, in a project that could seriously damage the Lacandona rain forest, according to environmentalists and archaeologists in Mexico and the US. It could also flood some of the country's most famous archaeological sites, they say. The dam would be built on the Rio Usumacinta, which flows through the Lacandona, North America's largest rain forest. The dam, if sufficiently high, could lead to the flooding of the ninth century Mayan city-states Yaxchilan and Piedras Niegras. Ms Linda Schele, professor of art at the University of Austin, Texas, said she had 'no doubt that one of the greatest heritages of the human species will be buried and lost forever without ever having been investigated.' Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission has said that the project would not damage archaeological sites and would not be approved until an environmental and cultural impact study was completed. The project, an earlier and larger version of which was dropped in 1989, has particularly enraged environmentalists since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari last month declared Yaxchilan part of an extended eco-archaeological reserve in the Lacandona. Mr Homero Aridjis, president of the Grupo de los Cien environmental group, said: 'It is another example of the government keeping people in the dark and spreading disinformation.' Mr Jeffrey Wilkerson, of the US institute for Cultural Ecology of the Tropics, feared that the building of the dams would lead to new roads, and settlements that would break up the rain forest's fragile eco-system, and disrupt the culture of the Lacandon, an Indian tribe that lives in the forest. Mexico has just completed a census that shows population growth is slowing, that the average age is rising, and, amazingly, that Mexico City is shrinking. The census estimates that just 81.3m people live in the country, of whom 38 per cent are less than 40 years old  - compared with unofficial estimates of around 88m. The average age has increased from 16 to 19 years old. The population as a whole rose by an average of just 2.3 per cent in the decade.
19920219000000000	FT  19 FEB 92 / World Trade News: China 'will need foreign capital for Yangtze dam'. CHINA will need foreign capital and manufacturing expertise to go ahead with the Three Gorges project to control flooding in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River through construction of a huge dam, Simon Holberton reports from Hong Kong. Zhao Chuanshao, a ministry of water resources official, said China was 'interested in securing foreign loans' to finance the multi-million-dollar project and leading foreign manufacturers to help make parts for the project, the English-language China Daily reported yesterday. China would be willing to import technologies and materials to build the 680,000KW turbo-generators and the 500,000-volt transmission lines to carry electricity generated. The dam would dwarf any in the US and exceed the capacity of Brazil's dam at Itaipu, the world's biggest. A water level of 150 metres would produce a reservoir stretching 250 miles.
19920407000000000	FT  07 APR 92 / A million must move for China's next great wall: Yvonne Preston surveys some of the human and environmental costs of the Three Gorges Dam project. IN THE middle reaches of the majestic Yangtze river, sheer cliff faces and mountains rise from turbulent waters to form the Three Gorges, an inspiration to Chinese poets and artists down the centuries. One of the world's scenic wonders, it is the site of the planned Three Gorges dam, an engineering project - given the go-ahead by the Chinese parliament last Friday - which will not only change the landscape forever, but cost more than 1m people their homes, and swamp 23,800 hectares of arable land, 657 factories and mines, 139 power stations and 956km of roads. The scheme, incorporating the biggest hydro-power station and largest ship-lift in the world and an unprecedented five ship locks, is costed at 57bn yuan (Pounds 6bn) at 1990 prices. Such is the controversy surrounding it that a third of the deputies in the normally tame National People's Congress failed to give it their rubber-stamp vote. The Three Gorges - Qutang, Wuxia and Xiling - will be dominated by the reservoir which will stretch out behind the 185-metre high dam when it reaches the proposed 175-metre water level 15 years from the start of construction. The 600km reservoir will be a tranquil body of water, twice the width of the present turbulent river, improved navigation being one of the project's proclaimed benefits. Others are flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze  - and power, for which China has an insatiable appetite. The project will generate 84bn kw/h of hydro-electric power a year, one-eighth of China's 1991 output. The water level in Qutang, the smallest and most westerly of the Three Gorges, only 100 metres wide at its narrowest point, is set to rise 90 metres. In the hillside town of Wanxian at the western approach to the Gorges, population 30,000, the level the water will reach is marked on buildings. Few will be above. The town will be re-built back from the river with some of the 18.5bn yuan allocated to resettlement from the project's budget of 57bn yuan. Some private scepticism was expressed in Wanxian county, which has a high proportion of all the people to be moved, that the money promised by the central government would be forthcoming. The reservoir will flood 19 counties and municipalities in the two provinces of Sichuan and Hubei, swamping hundreds of populated areas, including the cities of Wanxian and Fuling with 100,000 people. Altogether 140 towns and hundreds of villages are to go, though officials claim none will be totally submerged. The dam will cost 1.13m people their homes by the time the project nears completion in the year 2008. Tang Dengqing from the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission in Wuhan, responsible for helping to plan new cities and towns and develop barren land for displaced farmers, says moving so many people is unparalleled in the world. It is the most serious of all problems associated with the dam, he says. Sites have been chosen for the new cities and an overall broad plan mapped. Experiments in moving have been conducted, though reports say people show reluctance to go. The new county town of Badong, 2km from the original site, has basically taken shape after five years construction. Those to be resettled from urban areas - 60 per cent of the total - are less of a problem than peasant farmers, says Tang. Scratching a poor living from terraced plots often high on mountain sides, they must now be moved higher to still less hospitable land. There are also conflicts of interest between provinces. Hubei province, down-river of the dam gains from flood control, cheap power and new jobs, but has only 15 per cent of the people to be displaced. Upriver of the dam the much poorer and heavily populated Sichuan province gets 10 per cent of the power but is home to the remaining 85 per cent of the people to be displaced. Sichuan faces an increased risk of flooding, as the water level up-river rises. There is an additional risk that the accumulation of silt will affect navigation to Chongqing, Sichuan's largest port. Deputy director of the Three Gorges project office in the city, economist Sun Lai Yan, says 50,000 people within the municipal area will have to move. Many have urged the government to do more research on the project before going ahead. The governor of Sichuan province, Zhang Haoruo, cast his vote for the dam at the weekend, but even he acknowledges the majority of Sichuanese are opposed. There have been rumours, officially denied, that elder statesman Deng Xiaoping, born in Sichuan, had expressed reservations. Through the 40 years of debate since the project was first proposed, uncertainty has inhibited development along the affected area, which remains poor and lacking in investment funds. The point is re-iterated by official spokesmen backing the scheme. Critics remain concerned about the risk of reservoir-induced earthquakes, the threat of river banks collapsing, and the accumulation of silt in the first 50 years of operation, affecting generating capacity and shortening the dam's useful life. Money is another question. China can afford it, the minister for water conservancy and power, Yang Zhenhuai, said in Beijing after the vote. Funds would come from the state, from the generation of power which would begin nine years after the start of construction, from the sale of bonds and from preferential foreign loans. Harnessing the Yangtze has been an aspiration of the Chinese Communist Party since Mao Zedong visited the dam site in the 1950s. The appeal of an heroic project to today's leaders is a powerful impetus behind the largest construction project since the founding of the People's Republic.
19920404000000000	FT  04 APR 92 / Chinese congress votes for giant hydro-electric scheme: Go-ahead for controversial plan for world's biggest reservoir. THE Chinese parliament yesterday voted in favour of the controversial Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river, the biggest hydro-electric project in the world, capable of generating one-eighth of all the power now produced in China. Over the last 40 years of communist rule numerous research studies into the feasibility of the dam, first proposed 70 years ago, have been conducted, but no decision made. The giant scheme, costed at 57bn yuan (Pounds 8.2bn), has been criticised inside and outside China on scientific, economic, environmental, social and even defence grounds. The 600km-longreservoir backed up behind the dam could be vulnerable to nuclear attack, opponents say. The most recent feasibility study, completed in November 1988, recommended building the dam at the eastern end of the Yangtze's famous Three Gorges, one of the world's scenic wonders. Ten experts refused to sign the report. The project was denounced in 1988 by Chinese critics as a Stalinist folly. The vice-chairman of the China Democratic League, one of the country's eight non-communist political parties, said China could not afford it. Bankers warned of ballooning cost over the 18 years it would take to build. The National People's Congress voted 1,767 to 177 in favour of building the dam, but 664 abstained, the most in memory on any vote. The benefits of centrally planned flood control and a huge power generating capacity outweigh the scheme's defects, China's communist leaders argue. But even the government acknowledges the magnitude of the problems, including the displacement of more than 1m Chinese whose homes will be flooded. All kinds of opinions were still welcome even after the project was approved by the NPC, chairman Wan Li said early this week, anticipating today's favourable vote while acknowledging dissent. Dissenters include NPC deputies from Hong Kong and Taiwan and those seeking to delay the project because of its cost and complex technical problems, including sedimentation. The Sichuan port city of Chongqing at the western end of the reservoir could silt up. Upriver of the dam, Sichuan province bears the brunt of the project's environmental damage and has 85 per cent of the people to be moved. The flood-control and power-generating benefits go primarily to the citizens of downstream Hubei province. Widespread flooding in eastern and central China last summer, which killed hundreds of people and cost billions of yuan, gave impetus to the Three Gorges scheme. The starting date will depend on China's future financial situation but trial resettlement of people is already under way. The congress ended its annual session by approving humiliating changes to hardline premier Li Peng's state-of-the-nation report, in a clear victory for reformists. This year's congress took place amid a power struggle between Marxist conservatives and economic reformers led by 87-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
19920602000000000	FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (5): The power utility is fighting back - Profile of Hydro-Quebec. THE past few years have not been kind to Hydro-Quebec, North America's third biggest power utility. Recession has slowed growth in demand for electricity, two successive winters of low snowfall have reduced generating capacity at hydro-electric dams, a heavy construction programme has forced up Hydro-Quebec's electricity rates faster than the rate of inflation. To cap it all, this bastion of Quebec pride has found itself on the defensive in an intense battle with environmentalists and the province's own aboriginal community over the enormous hydro-electric scheme which it plans to build on the Great Whale river flowing into Hudson Bay. The New York Power Authority, which was to be the lead customer for the electricity from Great Whale, cancelled its CDollars 17bn contract with Hydro-Quebec earlier this year. It's a matter of debate whether the NYPA was swayed by the environmental protests or simply by the recession's impact on its customers' appetite for electricity. But there is no doubt that the decision has set back Hydro-Quebec's plans to stitch together one of the world's biggest hydro-electric grids in northern Quebec. Mr Richard Drouin, the utility's amiable chairman, acknowledges the problems of the past, as well as the challenges which remain. He is confident some of the pressures will ease over the next few years. Hydro-Quebec had a glimmer of welcome news in the first quarter, with an 8.1 per cent rise in electricity sales thanks to an unusually cold winter, a new export contract in New England, and the small matter of an extra leap-year day in February. In the longer term, Mr Drouin predicts that the competition hydro-electric power has faced from cheap, clean natural gas will wane when consumers discover that gas prices can go up as sharply as they go down. He adds that as the utility's construction programme slows down in the mid-1990s, price increases could drop to, or even below, the overall inflation rate. Finally, Mr Drouin has no hesitation in predicting that the New York Power Authority will be back in the market for hydro-electric power from Quebec before long. 'We're not trying to get the whole New York market,' he says. 'We're only trying to get one-thirtieth of it.' Hydro-Quebec has always insisted that none of its new projects are driven entirely by export contracts. While Great Whale will no longer be needed to supply power to New York in 1998 as originally planned, the utility still plans to press ahead with the CDollars 12bn project once a thorough environmental assessment by the federal and provincial governments is complete. It expects construction to start towards the end of next year, with the first generating station being commissioned around the turn of the century. The second and third phases will probably be postponed. They are tentatively scheduled for completion in 2007 and 2008, five years later than planned. Lengthy environmental reviews may delay two other northern Quebec projects, known as Eastmain-1 and Laforge-2. Although Great Whale is on a more distant horizon, Hydro-Quebec still has its hands full with projects on the La Grande River, about 150 miles to the south. Four generating stations, with a capacity of almost MW4,700, are scheduled for completion by 1995, largely to meet demand from new aluminium smelters along the St Lawrence River. In an effort to spread its risks, Hydro-Quebec has begun encouraging co-generation projects, mostly in partnership with local pulp and paper mills. It aims to buy up to MW750 of power from co-generation plants by 1996, and is sifting through a pile of applications from potential suppliers. The busy construction programme requires heavy borrowing on both domestic and international capital markets. Mr Michel Labonte, vice-president for finance, estimates the utility's borrowing needs, including refinancings, at CDollars 4.5bn this year, CDollars 3bn in 1993 and CDollars 4.5bn in 1994. The utility is leaving few stones unturned in its efforts to tap outside sources of finance. In April, it became the first buyer outside the aircraft industry to finance new equipment, in this case four gas turbines, through a US Ownership Foreign Sales Corporation. These deals are a complex form of lease, driven mainly by tax advantages for investors. Hydro-Quebec completed its first global bond issue last year. It made its debut in the Euro-French franc market last March, and has become increasingly active in the US medium-term note market. It expects to expand its commercial paper programme to about CDollars 500m by the end of this year. Mr Drouin says that contrary to some press reports, the cancellation of the New York contract will not affect Hydro-Quebec's ability to service its US dollar debt. The new aluminium smelters, which will be Hydro-Quebec's biggest new customers in 1992 and 1993, will pay for their electricity in US dollars. 'We don't feel threatened at all, currency-wise,' Mr Labonte says. Nonetheless, the row over the NYPA contract has taught Hydro-Quebec some lessons it won't easily forget. 'It made us more aware that in the 1990s there were people around us who could affect our operations, and that we should be more aggressive than passive,' says Mr Drouin.
19920521000000000	FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (17): The neighbours are suspicious - The biggest project in the Mediterranean. THE FIRST kilowatt of electricity is expected to be generated later this year as engineers open the flood gates onto the first of the eight Swiss-built turbines installed on the massive USDollars 4bn Ataturk dam complex in southern Turkey. This dazzling engineering achievement has become a symbol of Turkey's industrial self-reliance and long-term planning. It has also engendered the suspicion of Turkey's neighbours downstream on the Euphrates. The south-east Anatolian project or Gap, as it sometimes better known, is currently the largest development project in the Mediterranean. When fully implemented, it will comprise 22 dams and 19 power stations, providing a third of Turkey's projected energy needs. It will account for half of the country's irrigated land, with around 1.7m hectares under irrigation. The project and the services attracted to the area in its wake will create jobs for some 5m people. Since the foundation stones were laid in 1981 the Gap project has absorbed USDollars 9bn. By 2005 Turkey is set to spend a further Dollars 23bn while another Dollars 10bn will be needed to complete the project sometime in the next century. The burden on the Turkish economy has been enormous. To date, almost all of the funds have been raised by the budget without the assistance of donors wary of touching a project which involves a riparian dispute. Indeed, many economists believe it has been the single largest factor behind Turkey's 70 per cent rate of inflation. Every year, the Gap absorbs 10 per cent of total government outlays, which does not include the subsidies and investment incentives given to private business to move to the area. 'What we would like to see is all the power stations complete by 2005,' says Mr Olcay Unver, president of the Gap authority in Ankara. The politicians also have few doubts. Both Turgut Ozal, the president and Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, are engineers. As a young electrical engineer, Mr Ozal cut his teeth working on the Keban dam. For this reason, the project seems destined to be finished. When Gap was first conceived, it was seen primarily as a way of providing alternative sources of energy in the wake of the 1972 oil crisis. The project was also set to transform this dry south-eastern corner of Turkey. Today, the environmental effects are less clear. The social and political benefits have still to be demonstrated, but Turkey's large construction groups have gained invaluable experience. This is now paying dividends in former Soviet republics and other regions. The centrepiece of the project is the Ataturk dam, the fifth largest in the world. It is close to completion. 'We need two or three average years and the reservoir will be full,' says Mr Mustafa Buke of the state hydraulic corporation DSI. Engineers estimate, given the unusually heavy snow fall this winter, that the water level could reach the required 513 metres by November and the first turbines could then be brought into action. The current level is around 503 metres. When it reaches 526 metres, the twin Urfa tunnels will start to irrigate some 250,000 hectares on the Haran plain close to the Syrian border. Officials no longer hold out great hopes that it will contribute much to resolving the crisis for the region's Kurdish-speaking population. They seem increasingly disenchanted with the politicians in Ankara and now provide growing support for the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), fighting for a separate state in south-east Turkey. The social benefits are also being reassessed. Officials say they hope only to be able to stabilise the current population and stem the trend of urban migration which has had such a devastating effect on city services in Istanbul and Izmir in recent years. It is not even certain that the project will help hasten the redistribution of land. Many officials concede that as the areas move to more intensive farming methods and the need for greater scale economies, there may be a case for the concentration of land holdings, giving the aghas or hereditary feudal landlords even more control over the area. Internationally, the Gap project has also met with criticism. In 1987 Turkey and Syria signed a protocol which guaranteed that 500 cubic metres a second would pass across the shared border. The agreement stipulates that the deal will last for as long as the reservoir is being filled 'or until a permanent sharing of the water can be agreed'. The sides have not met since July 1990, before the Gulf War, the last occasion for the trilateral technical meeting between Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Iraq in theory is due to host the next meeting in Baghdad but, while its international isolation continues, that may be some way off. The Syrians' concern is that Turkey's plans could jeopardise the efficiency of their own hydro-electric dams which provide 75 per cent of the country's power generation. Damascus also worries about the downstream effects of pollution if Turkey uses pesticides and fertilisers in its irrigated land. It argues that the Ataturk dam will take all the rich silt from the water and thus make it less useful for downstream irrigation. However, Turkish officials point out with some justification that the Syrians started work on their own Taqba dam some 10 years before the foundations were laid for the Ataturk, with similar effects. The Syrians' long-term fear is that water could be used as a political and strategic weapon. This explains their reluctance to attend last year's planned international water conference to have been held in Istanbul which was consequently cancelled. Because of Syrian misgivings, many of the prospective international donors have fought shy of the Gap project. The World Bank extends close to Dollars 1bn to Turkey every year, but has rules which exclude it from lending on a project involving a water dispute between riparian neighbours. Japan withdrew a Dollars 600m irrigation proposal. A Japanese official confirmed that Tokyo would be unable to extend financing until a solution was achieved over the water issue. 'This water is not a present of nature. We have to import equipment to clear the snow. This means spare parts. We have to employee people,' says Mr Ferruh Anik, the director general of DSI. 'Every Turkish citizen has a tax on his water. This is not free water. What the Syrians and Iraqis are getting now: that's free water.'
19920721000000000	FT  21 JUL 92 / Malaysia dam dispute opens floodgates of hostility: Claims for compensation and revenue have held up a multi-million-dollar hydro-electric project. A POLITICAL and economic battle over a multi-million-dollar dam project is being fought in Malaysia's jungle. The adversaries are the federal government, led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the combative prime minister, and the local government controlled by the strongly Moslem Parti Islam sa-Malaysia (PAS) in the eastern state of Kelantan. Balfour Beatty, the British engineering company, is in the crossfire. It has been awarded a substantial slice of the contractual work on the MDollars 1.5bn (Dollars 600m) Pergau hydro-electric dam project, backed by loans and guarantees from UK and foreign banks, the Export Credits Guarantee Department, and the Overseas Development Agency. The fight centres on Kelantan's insistence that it is entitled to substantial compensation and revenues associated with the dam project, which will use water from the state's Pergau river. The compensation payment sought by the state, one of Malaysia's poorest, is reported to be MDollars 90m, and more than MDollars 300m is wanted for water rights over the next 50 years from Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's partially privatised electricity utility. Negotiations had been going on for several months but were broken off last week when the Kelantan authorities blocked several roads leading to the dam work site. All work stopped and more than 2,000 labourers were laid off. The federal government said Kelantan's financial claims were unreasonable and could set a precedent for a number of big development projects in other states. But then, after talks between the Kelantan authorities and Tenaga Nasional, an agreement was worked out and the barricades were taken down. The federal government was not satisfied, however. 'Until we get assurances from the Kelantan government that there will be no more disruption at Pergau, there will be no resumption of work,' said Dr Mahathir. He refused to rule out the possibility of the project being moved elsewhere. In mid-1989 the Pergau dam contract was awarded to a consortium of Balfour Beatty Cementation and the local Kerjaya Binaan group. At the time opposition politicians and environmentalists questioned both the size of the project and its environmental impact. Tenaga Nasional says the 600MW dam is a vital component in its plan to double Malaysia's generating capacity over the next decade and provide for the needs of an economy growing by more than 8 per cent a year. But the main battle has been between Kelantan and the federal government. The PAS gained control of Kelantan from Dr Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation in elections in late 1990. Although more than half Malaysia's 18.5m population is Moslem and Islam is the official religion, the country is not an Islamic state. Freedom of religion is guaranteed under the federal constitution. Kelantan is mainly Moslem and earlier this year the authorities there announced plans to implement hukum hudud, the traditional Islamic penal code which can mean the stoning of adulterers and amputation of the hands of thieves. While implementation of such a measure would need a constitutional amendment and would be unlikely to win the necessary two-thirds majority approval in the federal parliament, the government has accused PAS of stirring racial tensions and of frightening away foreign investors. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister for international trade and industry, says that while other states in Malaysia are attracting millions of dollars of investment from abroad, investment in Kelantan is drying up. 'The foreigners are worried about the proposed laws. They are no longer interested in investing in Kelantan since it was taken over by PAS,' she says. Meanwhile the Kelantan state authorities accuse Dr Mahathir's government of withholding federal funds from the state and intentionally discouraging investment as punishment for voting in to power an opposition party. Arguing for compensation for the Pergau dam project is one way Kelantan can fight the federal authorities. Mr Nik Aziz Nik Mat, the state's chief minister, says the federal government's unwillingness to pay compensation is the equivalent of someone repeatedly going to a coffee shop, but refusing to pay. 'It is not a question of barricading the roads, but it is our land that is involved and we have the right to it,' he says.
19920910000000000	FT  10 SEP 92 / Hungary tries to halt dam project. HUNGARY is making a last attempt to stop Slovakia diverting the river Danube into an environmentally controversial barrage along their common border. Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, yesterday persuaded Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, to set up joint commissions to head off confrontation over the Bos-Gabcikovo hydroelectric project. The timetable for agreement is tight because construction is approaching the point of no return. Slovakia plans in mid-October to force much of the flow of Europe's largest river into a 25km channel elevated up to 18 metres above the surrounding plain and bigger than the Suez canal. The Hungarian prime minister said in unequivocal terms yesterday that Hungary would consider the diversion of the river a 'territorial violation' and an infringement of the post-war peace settlement. Despite the agreement on further talks, yesterday's meeting between the prime ministers in Budapest left the two sides as far apart as ever. The Hungarian government can ill-afford to give in for domestic political reasons. The democratic opposition which toppled the former regime was born out of hostility to the communist-inspired dam. Slovakia, on the other hand, remains adamant it cannot afford to halt project. The Bratislava government says the work is too far gone and 20bn korunas (Dollars 746m) has already been spent on the dam, which will supply 10 per cent of the country's energy needs. Bilateral relations, already poisoned by the intractable dispute over the Gabcikovo barrage, are troubled further by disagreement over the status of the 800,000-strong Hungarian minority in Slovakia.
19921030000000000	FT  30 OCT 92 / End in sight to Danube dam row. HUNGARY and Czechoslovakia have initialled a provisional agreement to settle their dispute over the damming of the River Danube after EC-sponsored negotiations behind the scenes at this week's EC-Central Europe summit, reports Anthony Robinson. Mr Janos Martony, the Hungarian negotiator, said last night that the four-part agreement called for a standstill on damming work. The Czechs have guaranteed to supply at least 95 per cent of the normal flow of water along the old channel of the Danube and pledged not to operate the turbines of the Gabcikovo hydro-power station. The agreement also creates a five-strong team of three EC experts and one each from Hungary and Czechoslovakia to assess the technical feasibility of removing the diversionary dams and restoring the status quo. Both parties also gave a commitment to submit the case to binding international arbitration or to the International Court of Justice at the Hague.
19921029000000000	FT  29 OCT 92 / Danube dam threatens to open floodgates of hostility: An explosive project. SINCE last weekend wave after wave of Slovak trucks have been lining up on barges strung out across the Danube river near the village of Cunovo, a few hundred metres from the border with Hungary. Round the clock they have been tipping rock and concrete blocks into the swirling waters. Less deadly than the exchange of tank and artillery fire in Yugoslavia, the frenzied activity along this Slovak section of the Danube populated mainly by ethnic Hungarians is nevertheless one of the most serious flashpoints in the short history of post-communist Europe. Hungary accuses the Slovak dammers of violating its sovereignty and has invoked the emergency procedures of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Acutely aware of the hot breath of reawakened nationalist passions at home, it has also threatened reprisals against Slovakia if the damming is not stopped. Only military action has been ruled out. Budapest is outraged because the international frontier runs down the middle of the old course of the river and the Cunovo dam stops the river just short of the Hungarian frontier. It diverts the main flow into an artificial channel entirely within Slovak territory, leaving only a relative trickle in the old channel. Slovakia has responded to Hungarian protests about territorial violation by accusing Hungarian nationalists of wanting to stop the dam in order to damage the Slovak economy and exacerbate tensions between Slovaks and the republic's 500,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority. The Hungarian aim, they add, is to create instability 'to better pursue the policy of autonomy for Hungarian minorities and later restoration of the Hungarian empire,' according to Mr Julius Binder, head of Hydrostav, the Czechoslovak state company building the barrage. Western politicians appear only now to have woken up to the escalating dispute just 70km downstream from Vienna. 'The row has sparked a new, utterly unnecessary crisis in eastern Europe,' said Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, earlier this week while supporting Hungary. Yesterday, in London, attempts to settle the crisis with EC mediation continued against the background of the broader talks between central European leaders and the European Community represented by Mr John Major, current head of the EC presidency, and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president. The dam is a time-bomb left by the former Communist regimes who operated under the rules of 'proletarian internationalism' which turned state borders into little more than administrative boundaries and historical relics. The project goes back to 1977, when the two governments signed an agreement on a complex of dams along the Danube designed as a monument to socialist engineering and fraternal co-operation. But when Hungary's democratic movement emerged in the 1980s, it coalesced around opposition to the dam on environmental grounds. Ecologists argued that the dam and hydroelectric project at Gabcikovo would destroy the last remaining inland delta along the Danube and pollute drinking water supplies. The fear was, and remains, that carcinogenic sediment will build up in the reservoir and pollute the falling water table. Hungary's last reformist Communist government pulled out of the hydroelectric project under popular pressure and the conservative coalition government headed by Mr Jozsef Antall then unilaterally abrograted the 1977 treaty last year. But Slovakia, anxious to phase out polluting coal-fired power plants and Soviet-designed nuclear power stations, argues that it cannot afford to lose electricity from Gabcikovo nor waste the huge investment already made in construction. The economic case has become more pressing as Slovakia approaches independence, increasingly concerned about energy security and about its economic future without Czech subsidies. Mr Zdenko Pirek, the deputy foreign minister heading the Czechoslovak negotiating team, says they have gone out of their way to take Hungarian sensibilities into account. The Czechoslovak side is not diverting the waters at this time to start generating electricity from Gabcikovo but to prevent early flooding sweeping away existing construction work, they say. There the two sides stand today, each marshalling its own legal and environmental arguments in a campaign for international support, and moderates on both sides privately hoping that the EC will help them find an internationally binding face-saving formula.

19921027000000000	FT  27 OCT 92 / Hungary backed by Germany over dam. GERMANY weighed in yesterday behind Hungary's increasingly frantic efforts to stop Slovakia from damming and diverting the river Danube to feed the controversial Gabcikovo hydroelectric barrage. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, issued a veiled warning of the economic price of 'rash decisions' in the dam dispute after Slovakia began at the weekend to block the Danube with quarry rock and concrete blocks. Mr Kinkel said, without explicitly singling out Slovakia, that the European Community's 'goodwill' in providing economic support was in danger. 'The row has sparked a new, utterly unnecessary crisis in eastern Europe,' he said, repeating calls for a negotiated settlement. The strong German intervention drags the dam dispute squarely on to the European stage before tomorrow's summit meeting between the EC and leaders of the central European countries. Slovakia, despite pressure for a temporary halt, yesterday took construction beyond the point of no return, diverting much of the river's flow into its own territory. The Hungarian government reacted yesterday with talk of reprisals. Mr Janos Martonyi, state secretary at the Hungarian foreign ministry, ruled out military action but pointedly kept all other options open and cast doubt on the future of regional co-operation embodied in the Visegrad group of central European countries. Mr Martonyi re-emphasised Hungary's position that the diversion of the main flow of the Danube, the international border, represented a territorial violation as well as an environmental catastrophe in the making. Hungary says that the dam will lower the water table, dry up marshes around the Danube and damage the water supply. The Bratislava government argues that the Gabcikovo barrage complex is essential to the energy security and economic well-being of Slovakia, which is to become independent from the new year. The Czech and Slovak regional governments yesterday ratified a customs union agreement between the two republics, writes Ariane Genillard in Prague. The agreement was negotiated by by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart. It allows for the free flow of goods between the republics after they become independent on January 1 and should facilitate a renegotiation of the EC's Czechoslovakia association agreement. EC officials are tomorrow to meet in London the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Polish prime ministers to discuss extension of the EC trade agreements.
19921216000000000	FT  16 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Chilean dam to win funding. Environmentalists in the US and Chile are mounting a rearguard action against a proposed Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) hydroelectric project which they say will spoil the rugged beauty of Chile's Bo-Bo river and threaten the culture of the Pehuenche Indians. In the centre of the controversy is the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, which tomorrow is expected to approve funding for the Dollars 500m Pangue Project. This is the first dam in a proposed series of six, and the largest, most controversial hydroelectric project to receive IFC financing. Because other privatised energy companies will be seeking funds, IFC's handling of Pangue is likely to set environmental standards for projects to follow. Strongly aware of public concern, the IFC took seriously the need to work with the opposition. Chile's environmental record is enough to give any investor pause. While pushing ahead with economic growth under the Pinochet government, Chile also despoiled its resources. Santiago is second only to Mexico City in air pollution according to the Natural Resources Defence Council, co-ordinating opposition to the project in Washington. 'Copper smelting operations in northern Chile have produced dangerous blood levels of arsenic among local populations. 'Commercial logging of Southern Chile's native forests is rapidly eliminating some of the world's oldest temperate rain forest ecosystems. Overfishing has left all of Chile's important commercial fisheries in critical condition,' says the NRDC. Now a democracy, Chile has a fledging environmental movement which looks with suspicion at plans to develop the river. Three suits have been filed in Chilean courts to stop the project. ENDESA, the privatised electric company, planned the Bo-Bo development with no analysis of energy alternatives, and little public discussion or consultation with the Pehuenche. However, it needs foreign capital to complete even the first dam. After complaints from the NRDC and Grupo de Accion por el Bo-Bo, the IFC required a comprehensive environment assessment and an independent study of energy alternatives. It hired an independent consultant to evaluate the environmental assessment and overcame ENDESA resistance to making the results public. Pangue, due to be completed in 1997, is not a large dam by World Bank standards. It will create a reservoir 14km long, flooding an area of 400 hectares. Only 53 people will have to be relocated. The most immediate impact will be on white water rafters and kayakers. Environmentalists say the forests around the dam could become susceptible to logging, threatening an ecosystem which supports many rare and endangered species. These include the Araucaria trees, which produce pine nuts gathered by the Pehuenche; the Andean condors, pumas, and the tiny pudu deer. Operation of the dam will change the river's chemistry, endangering fisheries. ENDESA has promised numerous measures to mitigate the impact of the Pangue construction. It has also agreed to the Pangue Foundation, funded through an annual grant of Dollars 140,000 or 0.3 per cent of the project's net income, to help the Pehuenche communities. None of this has satisfied the Pangue opposition, which criticises the dearth of public debate in Chile over the project. Glen Prickett of the NRDC believes an energy conservation programme could satisfy the short to medium-term demand for new electricity in Chile, giving time for new developments in solar and biomass technologies. However, Monenco, the Canadian consulting company hired to assess energy alternatives, concluded that the Pangue project represented the best option for supplying near-term energy needs. The dam will be almost impossible to stop; construction is already under way. However, the IFC has made no commitment on the next five dams. It has also got ENDESA to agree to study the cumulative impact of the other dams on the Bo-Bo and its people before further development.
19930210000000000	FT  10 FEB 93 / Iraq muddies water of Turkey-Syria dam deal: Threats over Euphates project. IRAQ'S recent threat to take legal action against foreign contractors on a Turkish dam project was more than just another warning shot across the bows of Ankara's multi-billion-dollar south-east Anatolian project. The outburst is seen as an indication of growing concern in Baghdad at the possibility of a water deal between Turkey and Syria which could leave Iraq high and dry. Iraq's anxiety follows the recent accord signed in Damascus committing Turkey and Syria to find a 'final solution' to the allocation of the Euphrates river this year. Some diplomats in Ankara discount the move as yet another 'agreement to disagree'. However, for both countries, there seems to be ample reason to push for a more permanent settlement to this long riparian dispute. Ankara's control of the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, both of which rise in its central highlands and flow into the Gulf, has long soured relations with its Arab neighbours. Turkey's irrigation project, known as Gap, has been the main bone of contention - in particular, its plans to irrigate 1.7m hectares along the Syrian and Iraqi borders. Turkey has long resisted calls for a more comprehensive solution, reluctant to become embroiled in the disputes of Syria and Iraq, which in the mid-1970s came close to open conflict. With Iraq's continuing international isolation, any deal with Syria would undermine the case for an internationally ratified agreement on the water issue. Modest progress on the security front helped pave the way for the Damascus accord, in particular Syria's assurances to curb Turkish Kurd separatists on its territory. There was also a technical reason for the meeting. In 1987 Turkey agreed to guarantee to Syria a discharge of 500 cu m a second where the Euphrates crosses their border. Under that agreement, Turkey was committed to review the water allocation, once the reservoir behind the vast Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) Ataturk dam was filled. That day has arrived. But more than that, western diplomats say Turkey's decision to push for a deal is a measure of the desperate financial constraints facing the Gap project. Hitherto, the World Bank and other donors have refrained from supporting the project directly because of the outstanding water issue. According to western officials, only if Turkey solicits international finance can it afford to invest in the more costly water conserving equipment, an issue vital for the downstream users. That will only happen if a solution can be found to the dispute. Donors now believe the day of financial reckoning is fast approaching. The Gap has already consumed Dollars 9bn, much of it financed from the state budget. By next century, when the irrigation infrastructure and the 21 dams and 19 power plants are in place, the project will have cost a heady Dollars 32bn. As Turkey prepares to irrigate the first hectares on the Harran plain close to the Syrian border in May, the need to address the issue has acquired a new urgency. Turkey will want to reassure the Syrians of continued co-operation, although the Turks seem unlikely to agree to Syria's demands to increase the water supply. Iraq's latest snipe may thus cause a few ruffled feathers for the commercial banks and export credit agencies now being approached to finance the DM2bn (Pounds 833m) Birecik project. The consortium led by Philip Holzmann of Germany has been quick to point out that there are no plans for irrigation, only hydro-electric generation. In addition, the Turks argue that Iraq has already given implicit approval to the project, having signed up to a separate plan linking the power grids of Turkey and its Arab neighbours: the Birecik plant is the first stage of this five-country project and would transmit power to the Syrian city of Aleppo. Iraq's concern over Birecik may still prove premature. Hermes, the German export credit agency, is understood to have second thoughts about supporting a project which the Turks seem intent on financing using the more complex and largely untried technique of Build Operate and Transfer. Under such an arrangement, the contractor owns and finances the project, recovering its cost by selling its product, in this case electricity, back to the public utility. The public outburst from the Iraqis can only further deepen the misgivings of the lenders.
19930330000000000	FT  30 MAR 93 / India to drop World Bank dam loans: Government refuses to meet stiff conditions on Dollars 3bn project. THE Indian government is to ask the World Bank to cancel its remaining loans for a half-finished Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) scheme to dam the Narmada River in north-western India, following intense criticism of the project's impact on the environment and on villagers who will lose their land. But the Indian authorities are likely to press ahead with the project which would generate hydroelectricity and bring irrigation and drinking water to about 30m people. The Indian government is expected to disclose today that it will not meet tough conditions laid down by the World Bank six months ago for its continued participation in the scheme. India was asked by the bank to improve detailed plans for resettling displaced villagers and to prepare a full study of the project's environmental effects. The deadline set by the bank expires tomorrow. The bank's withdrawal will highlight the growing power of international environmental campaigners and raise doubts about the value of projects such as dams in developing countries. It could also prompt questions about future relations between aid agencies and Third World governments. Much of the Dollars 450m loan the World Bank committed to the project has already been spent. The bank will now block the release of the remaining Dollars 170m and could persuade the project's other foreign backers, including the Japanese government which has promised loans worth Y25bn (Pounds 146.2m), to withdraw. The Narmada project, first mooted in 1946, was delayed by disputes between the three states which share the Narmada's waters - Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The arguments were resolved only in 1979 and it was not until 1985 that the World Bank approved its loan. By then, environmental lobbyists' power in India and overseas was growing. Economists were starting to question the merits of big dams, in that they rarely delivered the full benefits expected and caused environmental damage. But the Indian government and the World Bank saw the Narmada scheme as a chance to learn from past mistakes. So the scheme went ahead with stringent conditions for resettling and paying compensation to displaced villagers and for an environmental master plan. The conditions were not met, however. Pressure from activist groups forced the World Bank in 1991 to commission an unprecedented independent review by Mr Bradford Morse, a former senior US development aid administrator, and Mr Thomas Berger, a former Canadian Supreme Court judge. The report, delivered last summer, condemned the alleged failure to protect the environment or the interests of displaced villagers. While World Bank officials continued to back the project, the bank's directors, representing member countries, began to voice doubts. The US, Japan and Germany, among others, last autumn raised the possibil ity of dropping the scheme. But a bank board meeting in October agreed to give India until March 31 to meet new conditions. India has been unable to forge a consensus on the bank's conditions between the central government and three interested states, not least because New Delhi has been preoccupied with the recent wave of inter-religious violence. Some Indian officials will be relieved they can continue with the scheme without time-consuming monitoring from the World Bank. They claim the bank has exercised inordinate influence, given it was contributing only some 15 per cent of the funds. But the World Bank's pullout could well boost the efforts of Indian anti-Narmada campaigners, who have won national attention by staging demonstrations on the banks of the reservoir which is steadily filling up behind the Sardar Sarovar Dam, the biggest of several being built across the Narmada and its tributaries.
19930525000000000	FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (10): Energy and the ayatollahs - Iran: Post-war build-up needs more power. Since 1988, at the end of the war with Iraq, Iran's industrial activity has ballooned from 30 per cent of capacity to nearly 100 per cent as it struggles to repair past damage and meet the demands of the present for a population of some 55m people. The government recognises that an adequate level of electrification, both in generation and transmission/distribution capacity, is crucial to the success of its economic reforms. In the industrial sector, where power remains heavily subsidised, the emergence of heavy industries such as steel, aluminium, and petrochemical refining have helped to boost demand to an unprecedented 20 per cent annually. Overall, most observers see total demand continuing to grow at 10 per cent or more a year for the rest of the decade. The two Five Year Plans published in 1988 and covering the period to 1998 show that Iran has allocated some Dollars 12bn of its future foreign currency earnings to the electricity sector, Dollars 6.8bn during the first Plan and Dollars 5.5bn during the second. There is also a significant sum representing goods and services purchased with local currency or through supplier credits. The exact value of the country's power generation equipment market (which forms the bulk of its electricity sector spending but excludes downstream industries such as transmission and distribution equipment) over the same period is less easy to determine. But it can be estimated by costing the ministry of energy's proposals for broadening the base and peak load generating capacity from around 13,200MW in early 1992 to an extremely ambitious 34,000MW by end-1998. Averaging the expense of a mix of thermal, gas-fired and hydroelectric plants at a conservative Dollars 1,000 per installed kilowatt produces a future gross figure of about Dollars 3bn a year of which local contracting and supply might account for 30-40 per cent. Although the present tight budgetary conditions, introduced to cushion the blow of the government's decision to devalue the rial, mean that such figures are probably slightly ambitious, western suppliers are under no illusions that Iran is by far the most significant market in the Middle East region. According to the ministry's power planning bureau, the total capacity of plants under construction at any given moment totals 80 per cent or more of the capacity currently in operation. The government has little option but to press on, as power failures and brownouts are already a reality. It is a telling reminder of the scale of the challenge that even if all the 30-odd power plants involved in the programme are commissioned on schedule, the ministry does not expect to enjoy any surplus capacity until 1997 at the earliest. The ministry of energy has mapped out a programme to meet both the urgent short-term undercapacity that threatened to strangle any hope of economic revival and provide cost-effective generation in the medium term and beyond. The last five years saw the widespread installation of simple cycle gas turbine sets of 90-125MW units which can be easily incorporated into older (pre-1980) thermal plants for immediate connection to the transmission grid. Many will subsequently be converted to combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) use by adding waste heat recovery boilers and steam turbines. By contrast the next five years will see the emergence of a mixed bag of thermal, combined cycle, and hydroelectric projects, the latter comprising four major projects on the Karun river in the south-west, and a 1,000MW pumped storage plant at Siabisheh on the Caspian sea in the north. However, large hydroelectric schemes cost around Dollars 1,500 per kilowatt. The completion of the Karun-3 (3,000MW) and Karun-4 (2,000MW) stations depends on Ab-Niroo, the ministry's hydro wing, securing sufficient foreign loans and supplier credits. The government already has permission from the majlis (parliament) to raise up to Dollars 3bn in loans and credits to help provide for both Karun plants, Siabisheh, and a 1,000MW extension to Karun-1. While a consortium comprising ABB Kraftwerke, Voest and Sulzer has secured the contract for the primary equipment orders for the Karun-3 hydro-electric plant, Japanese companies are tipped to win the primary contracts for the Karun-4 plant on the back of Japan's propensity to offer finance when others are increasingly reluctant to do so. Japan is expected to confirm shortly its decision to provide a Dollars 325m loan for Karun-4 through its official development assistance (ODA) programme. However, there is evidence that Iran may have trouble raising the necessary funds for several of these megaprojects - possibly deferring commissioning by years. US opposition to any further World Bank power sector loans is compounded by Tehran's view that many of the Bank's conditions, such as institutional reform and higher electricity tariffs, are unacceptable. Nonetheless, a Dollars 165m loan to the Tehran Regional Electricity Company (TREC) was approved by the Bank at the end of April to cover a range of electrification projects including part of the upgrade of the Qom power plant from open-cycle to combined-cycle. Any significant borrowing difficulties could impact seriously on the ministry's plans. 'Karun-3 is undoubtedly our top priority at this time', says Mousa Refan, chairman and managing director of state-controlled Ab-Niroo - also known as the Iran Water and Power Resources Development Company (IPWC). Large thermal plants will also play a significant role. Work has now started on a Dollars 450m turnkey oil and gas-fired plant at Arak in the west of the country. An international consortium comprising Canadian companies Babcock & Wilcox and Howden Group Canada, and Nuova Ciminmontubi (Italy) and GEC Alsthom (UK-France) will be supplying the 2 x 550MW plant for commissioning in 1996. In the short term, however, orders will continue to be for simple gas turbine and CCGT type stations such as Gilan (1,350MW) in the north, and Shahid Montazer Ghaem (1,080MW) and Shahid Rajaei (1,080MW) near Karaj, west of Tehran. In March, Tavanir, the state utility responsible for all power generation outside Tehran, took delivery of the last of 14 PG9001/E gas turbines supplied under a Dollars 350m deal with John Brown Engineering of Scotland. Rated 124MW each, the turbines are to be installed at the Shahid Rajaei, Shiraz, and Shariati plants, where they will later be converted to combined cycle operation. Anglo-French power group GEC Alsthom also completed delivery of a similar size order for the 14 complementary 125MW generators. Siemens KWU of Germany has also thrived in Iran, securing contracts or letters of intent for the Gilan and Tehran South (proposed 2,400MW) stations, although past controversy may yet return to haunt the company in the form of Iranian litigation over the incomplete 1,300MW nuclear station at Bushehr, abandoned by KWU at the start of the Gulf war. Through its Atomic Energy Organisation (AEO), the Iranian government has already spent an estimated Dollars 3.6bn on the plant, now blocked by the German government's refusal to grant export licences for crucial equipment. This impasse was sorely tested towards the end of last year when the Qeshm island Free Trade Authority, flagship of Iran's free market experiment, signed a letter of agreement with Siemens for the finance and construction of the first of four 250MW CCGT units. Under the terms of the agreement, Siemens will invest some Dollars 340m into the project, which it will continue to operate on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. If the government bows to AEO pressure to penalise Siemens, either through trade sanctions or by intervening to block the Qeshm deal, it stands to lose much of its credibility with potential foreign investors. Observers see the most likely outcome to be some form of compensation whereby Iran recovers some of its lost capital to reinvest in other programmes, while Germany protects its position as Iran's premier trade nation.

19931029000000000	FT  29 OCT 93 / 450MW dam to begin operating in 1997. A controversial 450MW dam in southern Chile, potentially the first phase of a Dollars 3bn hydroelectric project, is likely to begin operating in 1997 following signing by the International Finance Corporation of a Dollars 120m loan deal. The Pangue dam, already under construction, is likely to cost Dollars 450m. Agreement from the IFC, which also plans to take an equity stake of up to Dollars 4.7m, removes an important obstacle from a project plagued by environmentalist opposition and courtroom wrangles. Opponents say Pangue, the first of a possible six dams, will endanger the ecosystem of the Bo-Bo river and threaten the Pehuenche Indian culture. Endesa, the dam's main shareholder, says environmental impact will be minimal; only 400 hectares of land will be flooded and a handful of people relocated. Although the IFC agreement has been signed, disbursement of funds depends on 'completion and public release of a satisfactory downstream impact study', according to Mr Kent Lupberger, IFC manager for the region.
19931029000000000	FT  29 OCT 93 / Argentina and Paraguay in dam project. ARGENTINA and Paraguay are to privatise the huge Yacyreta hydro-electric dam being built on the Parana River that marks the frontier between the two countries. Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay and Carlos Menem of Argentina said this week they would decide next month how the Dollars 8.3bn project is to be sold off. Morgan Grenfell, the London investment bank, is to deliver a report in November analysing the various possibilities. Yacyreta, being built by Impregilio of Italy and Dumez of France, is the second big hydro-electric dam to be built on the Parana, and two more are planned. The Dollars 15bn Brazilian-Paraguayan Itaipu dam, the largest in the world, lies 300km upriver from Yacyreta. Construction of the dam, in which Argentina and Paraguay have equal shares, began in 1983 and has already consumed Dollars 6.5bn. The project has been repeatedly delayed by Argentina's political and economic crises. Mr Menem once called Yacyreta a 'monument to corruption'. Yacyreta is scheduled to comes on stream in September next year. Once all 20 turbines are installed, it will generate about 40 per cent of Argentina's electricity.
19940609000000000	FT  09 JUN 94 / Nepal dam plan a ticket to development - or waste of money: A look at a Dollars 770m hydro power project due for World Bank decision soon. The World Bank is due next month to decide whether to fund a controversial Dollars 770m (Pounds 513m) hydroelectric dam in Nepal after eight years of debate involving the bank, the Nepalese government and the project's increasingly vocal critics. Bank and government officials believe the scheme will help put one of the world's 10 poorest countries on to the path of economic modernisation by exploiting water, its most valuable resource. Opponents say the project, Nepal's biggest investment, is too big and too expensive. They say the country should first tackle other smaller schemes before investing the equivalent of more than the government's annual budget on a single dam on the Arun river in northern Nepal. The opposition is led by about 30 Nepalese, US, and European non-government development organisations, which are orchestrating campaigns in Kathmandu and in Washington. World bank officials concede that, even though about 80 per cent of costs will be covered by foreign aid grants, the Arun project could strain Nepal's fragile public finances unless the government carries out a comprehensive financial overhaul. But they say the government has already started the overhaul, so the risk is worth taking. The bank is promoting the project at a time of growing international concern about evidence that big dams in developing countries often do not deliver expected economic benefits and sometimes cause unexpected problems. The Arun dam is to be built in a remote, rocky and sparsely populated valley. Only about 150 families will be displaced. Local people mostly want the dam because a 70-mile access road to be built along the valley will connect its 450,000 inhabitants to the outside world. Environmental concerns are not central to the argument either: the dam will be wedged into the river bed and only a small lake will be created behind it since the normal flow of the river will be sufficient to power the turbines. The debate centres on economics. The Nepalese government first considered the project in the mid-1980s and reviewed it after the overthrow of the country's royalist administration and the establishment of democratic rule in 1991. Early proposals for a multi-dam 1,100MW scheme were shelved in favour of one dam with a capacity of 201MW - to be followed by a second 201MW dam later. The first dam alone will produce almost as much power as Nepal's existing generating stations which have a capacity of just 230MW. The government argues that Nepal must be bold if it is ever to ease its power shortages. Only 10 per cent of the 19m population now has electricity, and even they suffer frequent cuts. The country cannot neglect the value of its 42,000MW of potential hydroelectric generating capacity. With the help of the Arun project, Nepal can think of modern industries. 'Arun is our ticket to sustainable development,' says Mr Binayak Bhadra, a member of the government's National Planning Commission. The critics charge that the Arun project is expensive since it costs Dollars 3.8m per megawatt of installed capacity, compared with Dollars 2.5m and less for smaller schemes. They add that because of the time needed to build the road, the Arun project will not produce electricity for at least eight years, so other schemes are needed now. These include village-level micro-dams, medium-sized dams for towns and at least one large project - a Dollars 300m, 140MW project on the river Kaligandaki in central Nepal. Kaligandaki is more suitable for Nepal than Arun, say the critics, because it will cost only about Dollars 2.5m per megawatt of capacity and will be built faster because a road is already in place. The World Bank argues the Arun project is not expensive because the Kaligandaki river flows strongly for only four months a year whereas the Arun river flows at full force almost all year, so the dam's capacity would be more fully used. The opponents say donor countries, including Germany and Japan, which are making large bilateral aid contributions to the Arun project, are mostly interested in generating business for their own industries. Mr Bikesh Pandey, Nepal representative of Intermediate Technology, a British non-government organisation, says: 'We are being railroaded by the donors.' In a limited-circulation report on Nepal completed in March, World Bank officials acknowledge there are dangers. They say the successful financial management of the Arun project depends on the government continuing the economic reforms started in 1991, including raising tax revenues, cutting non-productive spending and further increasing electricity charges to reduce power subsidies. Otherwise, says the Bank, education and health care will suffer. 'Implementing the Arun scheme without substantive fiscal reforms would seriously undermine human resource development and broad-based growth and development.'
19940530000000000	FT  30 MAY 94 / Daring vision or time bomb: A huge dam planned for Sarawak. The jungle light quickly fades. The rain pounds like a hundred machine guns on the roof of the Long Murum longhouse. The men, descendants of Borneo's headhunters, their arms and legs covered in tattoos, sit round a flickering kerosene lamp. They chew betel nut and drink rice wine. Talk is of change and development. Here, in the heart of Sarawak, East Malaysia, plans are under way for South-East Asia's biggest infrastructure project - a MDollars 15bn (Pounds 3.85bn) dam nearly twice the height of the Aswan dam in Egypt. The dam, at Bakun a few miles downstream from Long Murum, will flood an area larger than Singapore. Long Murum and 14 other tribal longhouses will disappear. More than 8,000 tribespeople whose families have lived and hunted in the area for generations will be resettled. To some, Bakun is another example of Malaysia's confidence in the future and a tribute to the daring vision of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 'It's a project whose time has come,' said Dr Mahathir earlier this year. To others Bakun is an ill conceived scheme of doubtful economic merit which could bring environmental disaster to one of the world's few remaining areas of tropical rainforest and sound the death knell for a unique tribal culture. 'It will be an ecological time bomb sitting right in the centre of Borneo,' says Mr Sim Kwang Yang, a Sarawak-based opposition MP. Bakun has been discussed for 14 years but only recently given the go-ahead by the government. Producing 2,400MW of electricity by early next century, the government says Bakun will not only meet the needs of Malaysia's fast industrialising economy. It will also turn Malaysia into a regional power exporter. Bakun poses considerable technical challenges. It is being built at a site more than 500km upriver from Sarawak's coast. The journey to Bakun involves crossing a number of treacherous rapids. New roads will have to be built through dense jungle to bring in building materials and engineering equipment. Taking the power out of Bakun will involve even greater difficulties. Some of the electricity generated will go to Sarawak itself and to the neighbouring Malaysian state of Sabah. However, the bulk of the power will go to peninsular Malaysia, first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak and then through 650km of cables under the South China Sea. Experts point out that power transmission through such a lengthy underwater cable has never been attempted. 'They are either being very daring or very foolish,' said one Kuala Lumpur based energy company executive. Considerable power loss seems inevitable. Bakun will be a private sector project. In January this year the government signed a memorandum of understanding giving management of Bakun to the locally based Ekran company. The announcement was greeted with some surprise. There was no tendering process involved. Controlled by Mr Ting Pek Khiing, a Sarawak-based Malaysian Chinese, Ekran was established only in 1991 and has no experience in projects of the size of Bakun. Mr Ting, a swashbuckling entrepreneur who has made a name for himself as a tourist resort developer, is supremely confident. 'We can build anything on earth,' he says. Mr Ting says between 60 and 70 per cent of financing for Bakun will be raised from domestic sources and insists the project can be built in six years, without federal or state funds. Ekran is widely believed to be backed by Mr Daim Zainnudin, a former federal finance minister and an economic adviser to the government. Some tribespeople feel the change the dam will bring is part of an inevitable process. 'Our ways are altering anyway,' says Mr John Bampa, who works in the small town of Belaga, close to the Bakun site. 'As children we were taught to hunt wild pig and fish. But the new generation have been to school and have not been taught the old ways.' However, many tribespeople say they have not been consulted about Bakun or given any project details. Some reports say a series of dams are to be built in the area. In recent years 17 technical studies have been carried out on Bakun. A government minister told parliament this year those documents remain classified under Malaysia's official secrets act. Gara Jalong, one of a group of longhouse dwellers who two weeks ago tried but failed to present a petition opposing Bakun to the Sarawak State Assembly, says a government-appointed committee on Bakun does not represent the tribespeople. 'Many of its members have been responsible for selling our lands to the logging companies.' Logging is very big business in Sarawak. In the past tribespeople who have interfered with the activities of the logging companies have been imprisoned. Though Malaysia says it is committed to curtailing logging it is still by far the world's largest exporter of unprocessed tropical timber - most of it from Sarawak. Over the last 12 months prices of many tropical hardwoods have more than doubled. In a 1991 review of forestry activities in Malaysia the World Bank said Sarawak's trees were being cut at about four times the sustainable rate  -a judgment fiercely denied by the government. Mr Abdul Taib Mahmud has been Sarawak's chief minister since 1981. In exchange for support of Dr Mahathir's national front coalition government, Sarawak is left largely to govern itself. An uncle and political rival of Mr Taib once accused the chief minister and his political allies of controlling 30 per cent of Sarawak's timber concessions. Two of Mr Taib's sons are among Ekran's main shareholders. Mr James Wong, Sarawak's environment minister, also controls one of the state's biggest timber companies. Bakun is being built on the upper reaches of the Rejang, Malaysia's longest river. An area of more than 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres), much of it virgin rain forest, will be clear cut to accommodate the dam. Environmentalists allege logging has already caused severe soil erosion. Locals say ten years ago the Rejang's waters were clear and fish were abundant. Now the river, nearly a mile wide in places, is a muddy brown colour and there are few fish. Water levels fluctuate wildly. The government seems determined that Bakun will go ahead but is waiting for Ekran to submit an environmental impact study on the project. It has yet to decide whether that study will be made public. In the past Dr Mahathir has attacked both local and foreign groups that have lobbied on behalf of native peoples: he has said such groups would prefer to see the jungle dwellers living 'like monkeys in trees' instead of sharing in Malaysia's development. Lihan Ahang, a native chief at Long Murum, points to a faded black and white photograph of his grandfather, a warrior who fought against the Brookes, the White Rajahs of Borneo. 'We are not against development,' he says. 'But I am sad about this project. It means giving up our lands and leaving the graves of our ancestors. It means changing our whole way of life.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Bakun project  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compared with other large Asian and African dams  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Capacity    Generation/year   Storage capacity                             (MW)       (million kWh)     (million cu m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bakun      Malaysia         2,400          18,000            44,000 Aswan      Egypt            2,400          10,000           157,000 Tarbela    Pakistan         2,100          11,500            14,000 Kariba     Zambia           1,500           8,000           170,000 Akosombo   Ghana              850           5,400           148,000 Kossou     Ivory Coast        180             550            25,000  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Reservoir area    Dam height    Population                              (sq km)           (m)        displaced  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bakun      Malaysia           695             210             8,500* Aswan      Egypt            5,800             111            90,000 Tarbela    Pakistan           243             143            86,000 Kariba     Zambia           4,500             124            57,000 Akosombo   Ghana            8,500             113            70,000 Kossou     Ivory Coast      1,500              57            60,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * 1994 estimate  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
19940513000000000	FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Consortium named to build Portuguese dam. Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned power producer and distributor, has awarded a Es15.7bn (Pounds 61.28m) contract to build the country's biggest hydro-electric dam to a consortium of French, Spanish and Portuguese companies. The 136m-high dam at Vila Nova de Foz Coa in north-eastern Portugal is to form part of an Es52bn (Pounds 201m) hydro-electric power plant comprising two 72 MW reversible turbine units. They are due to begin production of 330 GWh a year in 1999. The winning consortium comprises Dumez of France, Agroman of Spain and the Portuguese companies Somague and Moniz da Maia Serra e Fortunato. A total of 16 Portuguese and 13 companies competed for the contract. The dam will form an 18 sq km artificial lake of 700m cubic metres. The plant will provide a strategic reserve in case of breakdown or low capacity of EDP's other hydro-electric plants on the Douro river, which flows into northern Portugal from Spain. Installing reversible turbine units will enable EDP to transfer waters from the Douro to the Foz Coa lake for subsequent use by power plants along the river.
19940719000000000	FT  19 JUL 94 / World Trade News: European groups win dam contracts. Impregilo of Italy, Zublin of Germany and Dumez of France have won contracts worth Yn7.3bn (Pounds 541m) for a dam project on China's Yellow river, agencies report. The Xiaolangdi water control project contracts for the main body, the flood-discharge structure and hydroelectric structure were awarded to a Yellow River joint venture. This comprises the three European groups and the Xiaolangdi joint venture. The dam site is 40km north of Luoyang city in Henan province. China has borrowed Dollars 570m (Pounds 375m) from the World Bank, including Dollars 460m for construction and Dollars 110m as a soft loan to resettle thousands of residents. In total China plans to borrow about Dollars 1bn from the World Bank.
19940707000000000	FT  07 JUL 94 / Paraguay seeks Dollars 4bn for dam. The Paraguayan government is seeking private participation in the country's third giant hydro-electric project, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said yesterday. The 4,000MW Corpus Cristi dam would lie between two huge existing hydro-electric dams, Yacyreta and Itaipu. According to initial engineering projections, the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) Corpus dam would be more efficient than either and yield an internal rate of return on investment of 27 per cent. If built, it would be by far the largest electrical project in the world financed by the private sector. Mr Wasmosy has agreed with President Carlos Menem of Argentina to privatise the Yacyreta dam, on the Argentine-Paraguayan frontier. Speaking in London, Mr Wasmosy said the government also intended to move ahead with its privatisation plans. It wants, through joint ventures or privatisation, to divest itself of five enterprises: the steel and cement plants, the merchant fleet, an alcohol and spirits plant, the railway system and the national airline. According to ministers travelling with the president, bidding for the money-losing airline, which has ceased operations, will open on July 8. A draft law now before Congress would give workers and suppliers 10 per cent each of the privatised companies at concessional terms. Telephone, water, electricity utilities and some other companies would remain in government hands. Mr Wasmosy said a summit of heads of state of Mercosur, the trade group which includes Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, will take place on August 5 to finalise details of a common external tariff. He was confident this would take effect at the beginning of next year. Yesterday he met Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, signing accords on investment protection and on co-operation against drug trafficking.
19940903000000000	FT  03 SEP 94 / Costly dam to be opened. President Carlos Menem will today inaugurate what he once called Argentina's 'monument to corruption', the 3,200 MW Yacyreta hydroelectric dam on the Parana River. The dam, among the largest in the world, has cost at least six times over budget and is still not finished, 11 years after construction began. Mr Menem will only be unveiling the first of Yacyreta's 20 turbines, which will eventually generate one-third of Argentina's electricity. The final bill for Yacyreta is not in yet. Estimates vary between Dollars 9bn and Dollars 12bn. The Yacyreta project began in 1958 when Argentina and Paraguay, which share the Parana river, signed a co-operation treaty to build the dam. However, squabbling between the two countries, Argentina's repeated financial crises and 17 changes of government over the last 36 years constantly delayed the project. Yacyreta's fame as a 'monument to corruption' - a phrase Mr Menem coined in 1990 - was born soon after the first feasibility studies began, with contracts reputedly being awarded to groups with the strongest lobbying capability in Buenos Aires and the Paraguayan capital Asuncion. The two governments own equal shares in the project. Bidding for the construction contract itself began in 1980 and competition was fierce. Dumez of France and Italy's Impregilo were the front runners in the bidding. The then military government of Gen Reynaldo Bignone eventually told the two to create a joint venture, which it awarded the contract just 10 days before the civilian administration of Mr Raul Alfonsin took over in 1983. Since then, the two companies have struggled through hyperinflation, a second change of government with Mr Menem's election in 1989, and his surprise conversion to free market economics. They have also coped with three different currencies and three radical shifts in economic policy over the last 11 years. Mr Menem now believes he has found a market solution to Yacyreta: he wants to privatise the dam, turning over its operation to a private company once the 20th turbine is installed and spinning.
19941022000000000	FT  22 OCT 94 / More heat than light in Nepal power wrangle: World Bank is worried about effects of a campaign against a hydroelectric scheme. The World Bank's ability to continue backing large-scale power projects in the developing world is facing a crucial test as a result of environmentalists' opposition to a proposed Arun III hydroelectric scheme for Nepal. The government scheme is being strenuously opposed by such non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as the US-based Environmental Defence Fund and the International Rivers Network, as well as the Arun Concerned Group of Nepal. The IRN and the ACG have announced plans to file a motion before the Bank's newly created three-member inspection panel. The motion will call for the project to be shelved on the basis that it is 'in violation of Bank policies and procedures'. The motion will be the first to be handled by the panel, which was set up in the wake of controversy surrounding the Bank's backing for the Narmada Dam multi-purpose hydro project in India. Under intense criticism by such groups as the IRN and Britain's Overseas Development Administration, the Bank last year took the unprecedented step of suspending its support for the 1,450MW dam and irrigation complex in north-west India, which involved the resettlement of at least 100,000 people. This meant the suspension of the remaining Dollars 175m (Pounds 107m) of a total of Dollars 450m in Bank commitments to the scheme. The criticism of the Indian project centred on the way the resettlement was being handled, including claims of cruelty to those being resettled, inadequate compensation, lack of Indian government compliance with Bank project guidelines and lack of Bank enforcement of the guidelines. Mr Joseph Wood, the Bank's vice-president for south Asia, in a recent interview said the Nepal and Indian projects could not be compared. Arun III calls for initial construction of a 201MW run-of-river hydroelectric scheme, which will involve the displacement of only 155 local families and will not require construction of a reservoir. The fall-out from Narmada and the criticism of Arun are causing worry within the Bank about its future involvement in large-scale energy projects. Long delays to Arun might prove fatal, senior Bank officials admitted. The Bank had already delayed financing approval several times as a result of outside pressure, and now was hoping to get its board approval by November 3, by which time all financing from partner agencies should have been arranged. Under the proposal, the Bank would provide a 30-year, Dollars 140.7m loan to the Nepal Electricity Authority. A further Dollars 34.3m is also available under an existing Bank facility. A total of Dollars 473m would be arranged through various bilateral agencies from France, Sweden, Finland, Japan as well as the Asian Development Bank. The Nepalese would contribute Dollars 443m, bringing the total cost to Dollars 1.09bn. Japan's contribution to the fund is crucial for the project but it is moving cautiously because of its embarrassment over its involvement in Narmada and is therefore conducting an independent assessment of the scheme. . The protest groups want to delay the project beyond November 13, the date of Nepalese national elections, and hope to see it supplanted by a more environmentally compatible complex of smaller dam schemes around the country, some as small as 10MW. Mr Gopal Siwakoti, ACG spokesman, says his group was not consulted sufficiently, parliament did not properly debate the project, and Bank and government authorities been have slow to provide project documents. He added that even if parliament was to approve the project following an open debate, the group would still oppose the scheme in favour of its alternative plan for smaller dams. Mr Siwakoti added that the project was 150 per cent more expensive than comparable power schemes elsewhere and would lead to substantially higher tariffs. Mr Wood, in response, said that numerous talks had been held in Nepal and abroad. He stressed that the Bank was supporting what was a Nepalese government proposal, not a Bank proposal. He said that the NGOs' alternative power strategy would produce less electricity and would not be significantly cheaper. There had been much debate, both in parliament and in public, and the issue had been well reported in the local media. 'Even the Communist party is not opposed to the scheme,' Mr Wood said. There had been some disagreement within the project evaluation team and the original road design had been changed. He emphasised that the country was now in the grip of regular power cuts. The capacity of Arun Dam, to be completed by 2001, would establish a healthy domestic power source, nearly doubling capacity from the current 241MW. 'This will make a hell of an impact on tourism, on service industries, light manufacturing such as carpet-making and on agriculture. . . We want to see more done with social infrastructure. We say electricity will help.' The opponents have made it clear they will work to delay the scheme in hopes of making it uneconomical. The Bank says that a one-year delay has already added Dollars 25m to the cost of the project. Frank Gray is editor of Power in Asia, a Financial Times energy newsletter.
19941214000000000	FT  14 DEC 94 / Dash to dam the Mekong raises ecology fears: William Barnes on the environmental cost of plans to control flooding and generate power. Creeping up on the millions of people who draw sustenance from the Mekong river is the threat of a dash to dam and exploit one of the world's longest rivers. Last month Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos agreed to resurrect their long-dormant Mekong oversight committee. The agreement  - brokered by the United Nations Development Programme  - breathes new life into decades-old plans to develop the Mekong Basin that were frozen by more than two decades of warfare and ideological turmoil in Indochina. There is only a handful of tributary dams in the upper and middle reaches of the river. Now Laos alone is proposing to build 58 dams by the year 2020, mostly to feed voracious demand for energy in neighbouring Thailand and eventually Vietnam. Mr Kithong Vongsay, chairman of the Lao National Mekong Committee, says the whole of the lower Mekong area could generate 37,000MW of electricity, of which Laos could account for 18,000MW. The country's two main dams produce 210MW and are already its biggest foreign exchange earner. Thailand, which also wants to irrigate its arid north-east, has virtually run out of dam sites because of local opposition to environmental destruction. 'This is a modern agreement, a pragmatic agreement,' says Mr Prathet Sutabutr, director of Thailand's department of energy development and co-operation. 'Each country will have the right to do what they think is justified in their own territory.' One US banker in the region says the work will be a 'bonanza' for construction companies, bankers and water engineers. But environmental groups say Mekong projects often ignore the fragile ecology of a region fed by a river which descends from the snowy Tibetan plateau to the warm waters of the Vietnam Delta. In the 1940s US engineers, fresh from numerous 'big dam' projects in north America, first laid plans for a cascade of 'multi-purpose' dams along the river for electricity, flood control, irrigation and improved river transport. Then, as now, would-be dam builders who cite their ability to 'control' the Mekong's annual flooding frequently omit to mention that the flooding is part of a complex cycle of natural activity. The Mekong's watersheds receive hardly any rain in the early months of the year allowing salt water from the South China Sea to penetrate 500km inland, as far as the middle of Cambodia. But monsoon rains transform the Mekong in May. The water flow into the Vietnam delta increases 30-fold and certain stretches of the river can rise by as much as a six-storey building. The annual reversal of the flow of water back into Cambodia's economic heart, the Tonle Sap lake, is unique and important fueling one of the world's most productive fresh-water fish industries. Ecologists say that 90 per cent of the fish in the Mekong basin spawn not in the river but in submerged forests and fields. Among the many complex arguments against rapid development is that dams which hold back silt might decrease downstream fertility, risk increasing incursions of salt water and worsen flooding. 'Still waters run dead,' says Mr Tyson Roberts, a specialist in freshwater fish from the University of California. 'The people who live above or below dams almost never benefit. But the worst dangers from dams can be downstream: it is quite possible to imagine the Mekong Delta itself (Vietnam's rice bowl) being eroded away.' Mr Roy Morey, the United Nations Development Programme's resident representative in Hanoi, says the new co-operation agreement  - which will be signed early next year  - is an improvement on the old one. 'For the first time the members have an avenue of appeal. Any arguments not resolved in the joint working committee can be sent to a policy-making council  - there was never anything resembling a council before.' Yet, says Mr Vitoon Permpongsacharoen, general secretary of the Project for Ecological Recovery in Bangkok, the new agreement weakens the old rule that member countries could veto projects that diverted or dammed the river and its main tributaries. The new agreement requires majority approval, at council level, only for projects that divert water out of the Mekong basin during the dry season. 'The purpose of this exercise is to legitimise dam building  - there's hardly any talk about people participation or about studying the ecological impact,' says Mr Vitoon. The reason wary downstream countries such as Vietnam have agreed this change can be partly explained by looking north to where China has quietly built the 1500MW Manwan dam. This is only one of more than a dozen dams the Chinese  - who are not on the committee  - are planning to build on the Mekong to spur the development of a region that has lagged behind the economic boom along China's coastal region. Faced with the possibility of a free-for-all involving powerful neighbours, some downstream countries have decided that some means of consultation and appeal is better than nothing. 'It was a good political decision,' says Mr Mok Mareth, Cambodia's secretary for state for the environment. Two decades ago an early critic of exploitation of the Mekong, Mr John Milton, observed: 'No real effort has been made to consult the people affected. . . no one asked those 20m or 30m people about their needs and problems or asked them what they wanted. . . . The assumption had long been made that those dams were going to be built; the only questions were how many, where and how.'
19941212000000000	FT  12 DEC 94 / Domestic funding for Borneo dam. The funding for a controversial hydroelectric dam to be built in the heart of Malaysia's tropical rainforest will be generated from domestic sources, according to the company in charge of the project. The Bakun dam, described by its developers as the the world's biggest private power scheme, is being built in a remote jungle area of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. Preliminary estimates put the cost of the project at MDollars 15bn (Dollars 5.9bn). Ekran, the listed Malaysian conglomerate which is developing Bakun, said sufficient financial resources were available in the domestic market. Nearly MDollars 6bn has been raised on the domestic market this year for projects associated with Malaysia's plans to privatise a large part of its electricity industry. Financiers have questioned whether the Malaysian capital market has the capacity to extend further loans of the size needed for the Bakun project. There are also fears the local market might be becoming too exposed to one sector. The Bakun project involves building a dam nearly twice the size of the Aswan dam in Egypt and flooding an area larger than Singapore. Plans are to transmit the bulk of Bakun's power output to peninsular Malaysia, first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak and then through 650km of cables under the South China Sea. Bakun poses technical challenges. It is being built at a site more than 500km up-river from Sarawak's coast and the journey involves crossing treacherous rapids. New roads will have to be built through dense jungle to bring in building materials and engineering equipment. An area of more than 80,000ha, much of it tropical rainforest, will be cleared to accommodate the dam and more than 8,000 tribes people will be resettled. Opponents of the project say the dam will be 'an ecological time bomb'. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has said Bakun will be a catalyst for industrial growth in Malaysia. It would meet the needs of Malaysia's industrialising economy, and turn Malaysia into a regional power exporter.
