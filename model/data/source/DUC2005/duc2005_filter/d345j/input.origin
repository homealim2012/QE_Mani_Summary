19910509000000000	FT  09 MAY 91 / Management: Pyrotechnics in French tobacco - William Dawkins reports on Seita's struggle to cope with the contradictions in its government's policies. The prize for the man with the least rewarding top management job in French state-owned industry must go to Bertrand de Galle, chairman of Seita, the beleaguered tobacco monopoly. Not only does the producer of Gauloises and Gitanes have to live with his state shareholder's recent conversion to the anti-smoking cause; de Galle also has to cope with the state's increasing interference in his business, a serious constraint since the French market accounted for more than 95 per cent of Seita's FFr11bn annual turnover last year. Proving the rule that nobody is more virtuous than a converted sinner, the French government has switched from being one of Europe's weakest to one of its toughest anti-smoking administrations. At the end of last year, parliament agreed a law banning all publicity for tobacco from January 1993, as well as restricting alcohol advertising to adult newspapers and magazines and a few radio stations. The government's temptation to curb Seita's freedoms climaxed last month when the group was forced to withdraw its latest brand, Chevignon, after a bitter political row. In support of de Galle the budget ministry argued that the new brand would not attract new smokers but it would help Seita in a laudable attempt to increase market share against US competition. But the health ministry's wish to curb smoking at all costs won the day, thanks to the decisive backing of Michel Rocard, the Prime Minister. The Chevignon brand was launched jointly with the designer of trendy youngsters' wear based on US 1950s designs. It was officially scrapped on the grounds that it contravened an infrequently observed 1976 law against the use of tobacco brand names on other consumer products. de Galle was understand- ably peeved, especially in view of the fact that the state has taken no action against cigarette brands like Cartier, Yves Saint Laurent, Battistani - named after an Italian fashion designer - and Dunhill, which appear to fall into the same category as Chevignon. 'It is difficult to make my staff understand why the state wants them to go on making cigarettes and at the same time that the public should not smoke,' he mourns. Faced with this contradiction, many people might feel that de Galle's position is untenable. Yet he explains: 'The problem is not that we have the state as a shareholder. It is that we are a company essentially active in one national market, and a national market where the constraints are very strong.' The group is not nearly big or profitable enough to afford the grand diversification strategies that tobacco multinat-ionals have practised with such mixed success. de Galle compares his company with the privately owned German cigarette group, Reemstma, which continues profitably to exploit its national market and has - wisely, he believes - made very limited diversifications outside its main business. But being fully owned by a government that is both short of money and against smoking clearly restricts Seita's freedom to raise money on private capital markets. Only in 1987 did it make its first profit in 11 years. With net revenues of FFr420m on sales of FFr10.3bn in 1989, Seita's most recent accounting year, it only just has enough spare cash to fund its own investments. Yet de Galle is convinced that Seita does have a future, albeit a modest one. The government's recent decision to allow private companies to take minority stakes in state-owned ones gives Seita a little more flexibility should it need a private partner, though de Galle has no specific plans. So how does he plan to get the group out of its present fix? Despite the strength of the French state's recent conversion to the anti-smoking cause, de Galle does not believe his market will collapse overnight. He is bargaining on a 15 per cent decline over the next decade in the 95bn cigarettes smoked annually by the French. There is scope to add to Seita's 52 per cent share of the French market by continuing its shift away from traditional dark tobacco, towards lower tar cigarettes, which now account for nearly two thirds of French consumption. Seita took its first step in that direction with the launch of the Gauloise blonde in 1984. It was seen at the time as a controversial attempt to meddle with a valuable brand image, but has helped to reverse Gauloises' decline against Marlboro and Peter Stuyvesant. Following the withdrawal of Chevignon, it has just launched a light version of Lucky Strike. All this buys Seita time, reckons de Galle, to continue the modest diversification he began when he moved from a senior Finance Ministry job to his present post in 1988. The point, he explains, is to make the best possible use of the distribution network that links Seita with the 39,000 state-licensed tobacconists or tabacs in cafes and newsagents across France - the biggest sales network in the country. This asset is a relic of the time Seita used to have a monopoly of French cigarette distribution which was abandoned at the end of the 1970s, though it keeps its monopoly on production. Even though foreign manufacturers are allowed to export to France freely, there is in practice no way of getting cigarettes to the all-important tabacs other than through Seita. Accordingly, the state group handles 98 per cent of all cigarettes distributed in France, a useful captive market which accounted for 61 per cent of the group's turnover last year. Clearly, the network could, at little extra cost, be used to distribute any product suitable for sale in a tabac, though Seita's efforts in this direction have so far been limited. It tried to buy the Belin biscuit company from RJR Nabisco two years ago, but was outbid by the French food giant, BSN. It has had better success in taking on the sale of telephone cards over the past two years; formerly the preserve of the post office, they have become essential to every French citizen. Sales accounted for FFr1.2bn turnover last year, just over 10 per cent of group total, a proportion Seita hopes to increase by introducing other products to the network. Seita also has small but profitable businesses selling computerised sales and stock-keeping terminals to retailers and has just begun to explore the idea of selling its distribution expertise abroad. In the meantime, de Galle has his hands full steering Seita through the curious contradictions of its national situation.  --------------------------------------------------------- Seita 1989  --------------------------------------------------------- Total world sales                               Ffr10bn Employees                                         6,200 French market share-cigarettes                      52%                     cigars                          45%                     pipe & rolling tobacco          69%  ---------------------------------------------------------
19910418000000000	FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Philip Morris net advances 22%. PHILIP Morris, the huge tobacco and food combine, yesterday reported a 21.5 per cent increase in after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 1991, to Dollars 942m. Earnings per share rose by a similar amount, to Dollars 1.02, compared with 84 cents, although the advance in operating revenues was slightly greater, up 24.9 per cent. Figures for the first quarter of 1991 include results from Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss-based coffee and confectionary group which Philip Morris bought for Dollars 4.1bn in the autumn of 1990. In terms of operating profits, the sharpest advance was seen in Philip Morris' international tobacco division. Here, profits rose to Dollars 509m from Dollars 382m, and Mr Hamish Maxwell, the company's outgoing chairman, said unit volume - including the relatively high-margin export business - increased by 23.4 per cent year-on-year. On the domestic tobacco front, operating income rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 914m, with 'slightly higher unit volume'. The US tobacco market has been in decline for some years. At Kraft General Foods, operating income surged by 24.5 per cent, but the results partly reflect Suchard's inclusion. Mr Maxwell said General Foods USA saw significant profit improvements, and KFG International also saw higher volumes and margins in Europe. Miller Brewing Company reported a slight improvement in operating income, but volumes were affected by trade buy-ins ahead of the excise tax rise on January 1. American Brands, the tobacco, drinks and consumer products group, yesterday reported a more modest 10.9 per cent advance in net earnings, at Dollars 216.7m, in the first quarter.
19920204000000000	FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco returns to the black. RJR NABISCO, the US tobacco and food group which was subject to a Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, has posted full-year profits of Dollars 368m after tax, compared with a net loss of Dollars 462m in 1990. But the bulk of the improvement came from the company's successful debt reduction programme, with net interest expenses for the year down to Dollars 2.11bn from Dollars 3bn. The group's 'business unit contribution' - operating profits before the amortisation of trademarks and goodwill - rose more modestly, from Dollars 3.43bn to Dollars 3.54bn, and in the final quarter actually declined slightly to Dollars 904m from Dollars 928m. During the past 12 months, the company has undertaken various refinancings aimed at replacing debt either by equity or cheaper loan capital. The steady improvement of the balance sheet since the buy-out has allowed RJR Nabisco to shed its 'highly leveraged transaction' status, winning access to cheaper bank finance. Yesterday, RJR shares gained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 . Domestic tobacco operations remained under competitive pressure, with lower volumes and higher marketing costs outstripping the benefit of price increases and favourable raw material costs. Net sales for the full year rose 1 per cent, but business unit contribution fell 4 per cent. The international tobacco side, however, fared much better, adding volume in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Net sales there increased by 19 per cent in 1991, while business unit contribution was up by 21 per cent. Overall, tobacco's business unit contribution for the year was static at Dollars 2.73bn. On the food front, net sales for the year increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 6.45bn, while business unit contribution totalled Dollars 920m, against Dollars 802m. However, this is partially distorted by disposals and by the contrasting consolidation of Latin American operations in 1991. The company said that, after allowing for this, net sales rose 2 per cent and business unit contribution was up 8 per cent. The food side, said RJR, saw the benefit of lower commodity costs and productivity gains, but this was offset in part by lower volumes.
19920131000000000	FT  31 JAN 92 / Smoke signals give encouragement: The international cigarette companies are targeting new markets. Growth prospects are now opening for international cigarette companies that would have been regarded as a pipe-dream a decade ago. Political change in eastern Europe and the removal of trade barriers in the Far East have given the four multinationals - Philip Morris, BAT Industries, R J Reynolds and Rothmans International - access to big potential new markets. Ten years ago, the world market amounted to 4,500bn cigarettes. But more than 60 per cent of that was virtually closed to the multinationals by communist and non-communist state monopolies. Today, world consumption of cigarettes is 20 per cent greater at 5,400bn; and western tobacco companies are barred from less than 5 per cent of it. Sir Pat Sheehy, chairman of BAT, says the prospects for international companies are better than at any time during his 40 years in the industry. The group's exports have risen from 45bn cigarettes in 1986 to 86bn in 1990. Philip Morris, the tobacco exports of which already contribute Dollars 3bn to the US balance of payments, says: 'The potential for our business overseas is phenomenal.' The group plans a Dollars 3bn investment programme over the next five years to increase its worldwide production capacity to cope with the expected demand. The surface of the liberalised markets has as yet only been scratched. The scope for growth can be measured from the fact that BAT supplied 10.3 per cent of the total world market in 1990, but a mere 1 per cent of the communist and former communist market, which accounted for 2,460bn cigarettes, and only 2.9 per cent of the 1,050bn cigarettes consumed in other countries with tobacco monopolies. The multinationals have continued to extract profitable growth from established markets in the US and much of western Europe in spite of a decline in consumption under the constant and growing pressure of health lobbies. But they are now brimming with confidence about the outlook for profits well beyond the next decade. In most of the newly opened markets, smoking is still on the increase; and consumers are showing a strong preference for the multinationals' products. Worldwide sales of international brands, led by Philip Morris's ubiquitous Marlboro, have grown by 7 per cent a year over the past three years, and they are gaining market share almost everywhere from national brands in western European countries such as France, Italy and Spain where state monopolies have previously dominated. new markets. The multinationals' salesmen are advancing in force into eastern Europe where the demise of communism has opened a potential market for 700bn cigarettes - eight times bigger than the UK's. Economic problems, political uncertainties, and poor service facilities may slow the profitable exploitation of opportunities. Mr Charles Pick, tobacco industry analyst at Nomura Research Institute, says: 'The market is characterised by a lack of hard currency, modern technology and competition.' Initial operations have encountered frustrating day-to-day difficulties with inadequate banking and telephone systems, and a chronic shortage of hotel accommodation and trained personnel. BAT's advance guard in east Germany, for instance, lived for a time in caravans and sent messages by taxi. The lack of clearly defined lines of responsibility between central and local government authorities in the republics also makes negotiation long and difficult. But the longer-term potential is worth serious investment. Mr Philippe Grandjean, spokesman for Philip Morris's operations in eastern Europe, says: 'We have to make a firm commitment; show that we intend to be a permanent partner in the new systems being established in these countries. We do not expect immediate returns. We are building a solid base for the future.' Cigarette production in Russia this year is expected to fall about 150bn cigarettes short of demand. Philip Morris recently signed a contract to supply 11bn, and will start producing Marlboros in Russia this year. It supplied the republic with 22bn cigarettes last year - and says it was paid promptly for them in spite of reports that other companies have been offered payment on a 720-day basis or various barter deals. R J Reynolds, which sold 14bn cigarettes to Russia last year, also expects to be producing Camel and other brands in a joint venture in Kazakhstan later this year; and BAT is investigating opportunities. In east Germany, Philip Morris has gained 44 per cent of the market by acquiring a former state-owned factory, and simply improving the quality of its F6 and Juwel brands as well as adding Marlboro to the range. Reynolds, which also bought a factory, has had less success with the local Club brand and Camel, holding only a 7 per cent share. occupied intermediate positions by using the factories of their west German subsidiaries to supply the new market. BAT has gained 11 per cent of the market, but its HB and Pall Mall brands lead the higher-priced segment. Rothmans has adopted a more cautious approach than its rivals, apparently believing that there is scope for losing money as well as making it. But its Golden American brand, developed to provide 'good quality at an affordable price', has a 16 per cent share. In Hungary, with an annual consumption of 26bn cigarettes, BAT has recently signed a joint venture agreement with the state-owned company at Pecs, which supplies 45 per cent of the market. It is also helping to improve the quality of the country's tobacco crop. Philip Morris and the Austrian state tobacco monopoly have jointly bought another cigarette company near Budapest which has been making Marlboros under licence for the past 15 years and has a 24 per cent market share. Multinationals are competing to set up operations through similar deals in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. While profitable sales growth may be slow in eastern Europe, Far East markets, with rising populations and personal incomes, are already a prime source of profits. Rothmans, for example, has 55 per cent of the Malaysian market, and it increased operating profits in 1990 by 70 per cent. Since US trade pressures cracked the government monopoly in Japan in the mid-1980s, Philip Morris has captured an 11 per cent share of the 320bn cigarette market - almost double the combined share gained by its international rivals. Volume sales of Marlboro and other PM brands, such as Lark, rose 22 per cent in 1990 to 35bn. BAT, too, is well established through Lucky Strike and Kent, produced by its US subsidiary, Brown & Williamson. Its John Player Special also occupies a profitable niche. Rothmans, which still has less than 1 per cent of the market, is investing in marketing its mild Dunhill Lights. South Korea, with an annual cigarette consumption of 96bn, has proved more difficult to penetrate. Four years after liberalisation, imports account for only 4 per cent of the market. The national monopoly still dominates distribution channels, and the international companies complain of red tape and an anti-imports drive thinly disguised as a campaign against 'conspicuous consumption.' The 40bn cigarette market in Thailand was only opened to imports late last year; but the internationals are becoming well established in Taiwan. Philip Morris brands lead the imports sector, but BAT's State Express 555 brand has a 23 per cent share and sales are growing vigorously. Rothmans is optimistic about prospects in Indonesia, where western-style cigarettes have made little impression on a market dominated by locally produced kreteks, a blend of cloves and tobacco. However, the prize on which all the multinationals have set their sights is China, where demand for cigarettes has grown by nearly 10 per cent a year over the past decade to 1,700bn, almost a third of the world's total consumption. Reynolds has already established a joint venture company in the country; and Rothmans, which has long been associated with efforts to improve Chinese tobacco farming, is a partner in a joint venture company which will begin to manufacture cigarettes in Shandong province in June. Philip Morris and BAT, with its State Express, Kent and Hilton brands, have been successful in selling into duty free and other hard currency outlets. Imports, according to Philip Morris, still account for only 0.3 per cent of Chinese consumption. Because of constraints on hard currency, nobody expects any rapid growth in the near future. But the prospective rewards are worth a little patience: just over 5 per cent of the market would equal total cigarette sales in the UK.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STATE TOBACCO MONOPOLIES UNDERGOING LIBERALISATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Market        Bn of     Market     Bn of     Market       Bn of             cigarettes           cigarettes             cigarettes               a year               a year                 a year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- China         1,683     S Korea      96      Turkey         76 Sov Union       450     France       96      Thailand       40 Japan           320     Italy        91      Taiwan         35 E Europe        250     Spain        82      Portugal       14  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EASTERN EUROPEAN MARKETS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country          Population    Smokers    Cigarette      Per capita                     (m)          (m)      volume (bn)   consumption  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Albania             3.1          1.2         2.7            860 Bulgaria            9.0          3.4        19.0          2,109 Czechoslovakia     15.6          5.9        26.9          1,724 East Germany       16.2          3.8        30.4          1,875 Hungary            10.6          4.0        26.3          2,485 Poland             37.8         14.2        94.2          2,493 Romania            23.1          8.6        32.5          1,412 Russia            286.0        107.3       442.8          1,548 Yugoslavia         23.6          8.8        55.5          2,355  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Nomura Research Institute Europe  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
19920130000000000	FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Charges hit net at Philip Morris. PHILIP MORRIS, the US food, drink and tobacco group, yesterday unveiled a 21.2 per cent rise in underlying 1991 profits, to Dollars 4.29bn. However, large charges for an accounting change and restructuring contributed to an overall decline, leaving net income for the period down 15.1 per cent at Dollars 3bn, or Dollars 3.25 a share. During the 1991 fourth quarter, the group took a Dollars 1bn non-cash charge for the accounting change and an additional Dollars 275m charge for restructuring its worldwide food business. As a result, net income in the fourth quarter dropped almost 13 per cent to Dollars 767m, or 83 cents a share. Operating revenues eased 3.7 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 13.7bn, reflecting the impact of currency translations and a decline in revenues from the group's North American food operations. Stripping out the one-time items in the 1991 fourth quarter, pre-tax income advanced 15.7 per cent while net earnings rose 21 per cent. Philip Morris said that its real estate and North American food businesses were the only units that did not post improved profits in the quarter. Mr Michael Miles, who replaced Mr Hamish Maxwell as chairman last summer, said the company's earnings and cash flow grew strongly in 1991 in spite of the US recession. 'Although we expect consumer packaged goods companies to face extremely competitive conditions in a weak economic environment during most of 1992, we are well-positioned for continued earnings and cash flow growth.' Operating profits in the domestic tobacco division rose 14.3 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn for the year in spite of a shrinking US market, where industry volume fell 2.4 per cent in the year. International tobacco profits rose 24 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn. Food earnings rose 14.4 per cent to Dollars 3bn on revenues that grew 8 per cent to Dollars 28.2bn. The comparisons are distorted by the inclusion of Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and coffee company, which Philip Morris acquired in the autumn of 1990 for Dollars 4.1bn. Most of the growth came from the group's overseas businesses. North American food saw a 7.7 per cent improvement in operating income to Dollars 2.1bn. Beer earnings advanced 13.3 per cent to Dollars 323m on revenues which grew 14.8 per cent to Dollars 4.1bn. Shares in the group rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 78 1/8 at mid-day yesterday in New York.
19920107000000000	FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: RJ Reynolds plans plant. RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group, announced yesterday that it plans to build a factory in Turkey to produce cigarettes by late 1993. The North Carolina company says the plant will have an eventual production capacity of 10bn cigarettes a year. The 135,000 sq ft plant will be sited in the Izmir region. The company said that it had earmarked more than Dollars 100m for investment in Turkey over the next decade. Turkey is a big market for cigarettes, and consumption is estimated at 80bn a year. However, it is still dominated by Tekel, the state-owned monopoly. The market was only opened to foreign cigarettes in the mid-1980s, but western products have taken an increasing market share. Philip Morris, RJR's big US competitor and manufacturer of Marlboro, has been successful. RJR, however, said that it saw opportunities for its three brands - Camel, Winston, and Salem. It expects to employ 300 people initially at the factory, but said employment could eventually total about 800. Mr Dale Sisel, head of RJ Reynolds Tobacco International, said: 'It's a large market, with significant demand for American-blend cigarettes, and there's plenty of opportunity for us to become a major participant.'
19920630000000000	FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: RJR Nabisco expands into Hungary. RJR NABISCO has made its biggest investment in eastern Europe, buying 87 per cent of Satoraljaujhely Dohanygyar, the Hungarian state-owned cigarette factory. The acquisition allows the US to make 5.5bn cigarettes a year in north-east Hungary close to the large and undersupplied Ukrainian market. Satoraljaujhely Dohanygyar reported 1991 pre-tax profits of Ft123m (Dollars 1.6m) on sales of Ft4.8bn. Production volume represents about 20 per cent of the Hungarian mar-ket. The purchase was achieved against strong competition from Reemtsma, the German tobacco company to which RJR Nabisco lost in the bidding for Debreceni Dohanygyar, another Hungarian cigarette factory.
19920528000000000	FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: RJ Reynolds starts work on factory in Warsaw. R. J. REYNOLDS Tobacco International has started work on a Dollars 33m cigarette factory in Piaseczno near Warsaw which is due to come on stream in the middle of next year and have an annual production capacity of 8bn cigarettes. The decision to build the plant is in contrast to the strategy of its rival Philip Morris which has offered to purchase the Krakow tobacco works which accounts for around one third of the country's output. Philip Morris, which recently bought the Czech cigarette monopoly, has a long-standing link with Krakow where it has has produced its Marlboro brand under licence since 1973. Last year output of Marlboro in Krakow reached 2bn cigarettes and Philip Morris is offering to invest Dollars 200m in the plant on top of the purchase price. The country's five state owned plants last year produced 90bn cigarettes while an estimated 10bn cigarettes are imported, many of them as contraband.
19920905000000000	FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris to open plant in Russia. PHILIP Morris, the US tobacco group, yesterday unveiled an agreement to build a factory to produce Marlboro cigarettes in the St Petersburg region in Russia. The deal with the regional administration is to set up a factory near the town of Vyborg, employing at least 600 workers and costing 'several dozen' million dollars. It follows a similar agreement reached by RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and foods group, to produce other well-known western brands in the same part of Russia. The Philip Morris target is to produce 10bn cigarettes a year at the factory, which is expected to be completed towards the end of 1993. Yesterday's announcement in St Petersburg was preceded by a marketing campaign in Russia's second city, with kiosks selling Marlboro at less than the price charged by new private Russian businesses and glossy adverts appearing in the local subway. On Tuesday, Philip Morris executives met Russian government officials to discuss ways in which Russia might repay a debt of Dollars 98.7m worth of cigarettes delivered in 1991 after Moscow was hit by 'tobacco riots' as a result of a domestic shortages. Strapped for hard currency, Russia has offered to repay the debt with a combination of raw materials, real estate and roubles. Marlboro is currently manufactured in Samara as part of the Constellation joint venture between Philip Morris, the Samara Tobacco Factory and the AvtoVaz Industrial Corp.
19921029000000000	FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (5): New ideas well received - Agriculture. NATURE has not been kind to central Europe this summer and Hungarian agriculture in particular has suffered one of the worst droughts on record. In spite of lower production, however, exports are expected to exceed last year's record Dollars 2.7bn by around Dollars 200m, underlining the importance of the farming sector to Hungary's overall economic performance. The European Community is the main market for Hungarian food exports thanks to lower production costs than Poland and and average export subsidy to producers of around 20 per cent. Germany is the biggest single market but the EC association agreement, which lowers levies and allows a 10 per cent annual rise in export volumes, gives a framework for further steady expansion in EC markets generally. The aim of government policy is to make Hungarian agriculture internationally competitive without subsidies, and it is this aim which drives the large scale restructuring and privatisation of both land and the broader agro-industrial complex now under way. The legal framework for the transformation of the communist collectivised agriculture is in place and, by the end of 1994, nearly 80 per cent of Hungary's 6.5m cropland hectares should be in private hands. After over four decades of collectivised farming, however, there is little desire or ability to return to small scale peasant farming. Ownership of most of the nearly 1,400 agricultural co-operatives will be transferred into the hands of 270,000 active co-op members, 380,000 pensioners and 460,000 former members and former owners or their heirs. The co-ops will lose their social obligations to local villages and many of their agro-industrial activities will be hived off and privatised. They will be re-laced by a mixture of private and family farms, farming associations and new-type co-operatives based on shared ownership and market-related production. Most of the 130 state farms will also be privatised although 14 of the largest and most technically advanced will remain in state hands to ensure that valuable stock breeding, seed selection and other expertise is not dissipated. A typical example is the Babolna State Farm, created by the Habsburg state in 1796 and with an international reputation as a breeder of Arab stallions. Always a flagship of Hungarian agriculture, today Babolna runs a successful joint venture chicken breeding operation with Arbor Acres of the US and supplies beef and chicken hamburger patties to McDonalds, which is fast expanding throughout Hungary. Several other foreign joint ventures are under negotiation. Babolna exports widely through the Middle East and Latin America as well as Europe and retains links with the huge potential markets of the former Soviet Union which it is re-developing on market-based principles. Opening up Hungarian agriculture to new ownership, new methods and new markets reflects awareness of the need for fresh capital and fresh ideas. This approach has been welcomed by the multi-national food companies. Kraft, Philip Morris, Tate & Lyle, Knorr, Ferruzzi, Unilever and others have all made substantial investments and are busy improving productivity, product lines and packaging. Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the ministry of agriculture, who is a leading advocate of the need for foreign investment to increase the value added to farm products, points to Phillip Morris as an example of the benefits. Last year PM exported Dollars 20m worth of cigarettes to the Ukraine from the newly acquired Eger tobacco factory which never exported that amount during its 40 year existence as a state factory.
19930128000000000	FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Profits at Philip Morris surge ahead to Dollars 4.93bn. PHILIP Morris, the large tobacco, food and beer manufacturer, yesterday reported a 17.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits last year, before the effect of accounting changes, to Dollars 4.93bn. The result was scored on a 4.7 per cent rise in operating revenues, at Dollars 59.1bn. In the fourth quarter alone, Philip Morris posted after-tax earnings of Dollars 1.2bn. This compared with Dollars 767m last time, but the previous year's figure was depressed by a Dollars 455m charge to cover restructuring in the food division. Operating revenue in the final quarter rose from Dollars 13.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 14.9bn last year - an 8.9 per cent improvement. Philip Morris's earnings per share last year stood at Dollars 5.45, up by 20 per cent over the 1991 (again, before accounting-related charges). The company had already signalled that it expected a rise of one-fifth in earnings per share, and the shares edged ahead only Dollars  1/8 on the news to Dollars 73 5/8 before the close. Mr Michael Miles, Philip Morris's chairman, said the group was 'optimistic' about prospects for 1993. He based this view on 'our growth and productivity initiatives, increasing volume momentum, and a narrowing of price gaps in a number of our key categories'. Philip Morris surprised the stock market at the time of its third-quarter results when it revealed that cigarette shipments, in volume terms, had fallen slightly, and were expected to dip further in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, it said that cigarette volume for the full-year was down by 0.5 per cent, mainly due the previously-announced stock adjustments in domestic shipments and lower level of Russian exports. Within this aggregate figure, domestic shipments fell 2.9 per cent, and Philip Morris's US market share declined by 1.1 percentage points, to 42.3 per cent. However, operating profit for the domestic tobacco business was up by 8.6 per cent at Dollars 5.2bn, on a 3.6 per cent increase in revenues, at Dollars 12bn. Operating profit from the international tobacco business also advanced strongly, by 19.1 per cent to Dollars 2bn, on revenues up by 11.6 per cent at Dollars 13.7bn. Operating profits from the food businesses overall showed a 10.6 per cent advance at Dollars 3.3bn, with sales improving by a more modest 3.1 per cent, at Dollars 29bn. The Miller Brewing Company, however, turned in a 13.6 per cent decline in operating profit, at Dollars 260m, on sales 2 per cent lower at Dollars 4bn.
19930107000000000	FT  07 JAN 93 / West targets Russia's tobacco plants. DONSKOI Tabak, the Russian cigarette plant at Rostov, is being wooed by the west's tobacco multinationals. The Interfax news agency reported earlier this week that BAT will 'take part in a competition for the right to buy shares' in the plant, probably later this month. Interfax quotes Donskoi Tabak's general director, Mr Yevgeny Balala, as saying that 'several Swiss and American companies' have now expressed interest in the 4.5m cigarette-a-day plant. BAT would not confirm the story, but did confirm that the three tobacco majors - BAT, RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris - are 'head to head in investment terms' in the former Soviet Union. It is a potential bonanza: a market estimated at between 400 - 700bn cigarettes a year and an unsatisfied craving for American tobacco has meant that they, even more avidly than the energy companies and with greater success so far, are scrambling to position themselves for future market growth. Furthermore, the Russian government's move to large-scale privatisation at the end of last year - expected to be greatly extended later this month - means that the foreign companies have a new way of buying in, other than concluding joint ventures. They can now bid for shares in the company at open auctions in competition with Russians - a method which, according to Interfax, BAT has already discussed with the Donskoi management at meetings last month. Of the three, Philip Morris, with its Marlboro brand, is the best known. It came in on the ground floor in Russia in 1990 (it had small production agreements before) with the request by the then Soviet government to import 20bn cigarettes immediately to satisfy a cigarette famine which caused more riots in that year than any other event. Philip Morris had built on that entree and now has firm projects which include a stake in a joint venture called Constellation in Samara involving the city's main tobacco factory, where Marlboro will be produced under licence. It also has a prospective stake in the cigarette plant in Krasnodar, which is about to be privatised. This has a capacity of 6bn cigarettes a year and will produce Marlboro and other Philip Morris and local brands; and an agreement to construct a 10bn-cigarettes-a-year capacity plant near St Petersburg, also for Marlboro. The company says it has no overall figure for investment, but says that the cost of the St Petersburg plant in the west would be around Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.7m). 'We are in for the long term,' says Philip Morris's Michael Parsons, 'and the investment will be significant'. BAT has been the later runner of the big three: but towards the end of last year, it signed a joint venture in Ukraine, with two plants at Priluki and Cherkassy, both south of Kiev, and is in an advanced stage of negotiations with the Java plant in Moscow. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, said in Moscow in November that 'the investments we are making are essentially long term. . . we do not expect to be making profits for at least 10 years.' RJ Reynolds, part of RJR Nabisco, last year acquired a controlling stake in the largest cigarette plant in St Petersburg, AS Petro - now renamed RJR-Petro. The plant produces some 22bn cigarettes year - all local brands - the RJR brand leader, Camel, nor any of its other brands, is not produced - allowing it to claim the biggest output of the big three in Russia. It also claims to dominate Ukraine, with majority stakes in plants in Lvov and Kremenchug, with a combined capacity of around 20bn cigarettes a year - again, all local brands. This gives RJR around 25 per cent of the Ukraine cigarette market.
19930430000000000	FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: RJR warns on impact of cigarette price war in US. RJR NABISCO, the US tobacco and food group, warned yesterday that profits this year from its domestic cigarette business - which accounts for more than half of group operating profits - would be hit by the looming cigarette price-war in the US. Additional marketing and promotional investments would have a negative effect on full-year 1993 results, 'although it is still too early to determine the degree of impact', the group said. The price war began when Philip Morris, RJR's US rival, said it would cut the price of its flagship Marlboro brand by Dollars 4 a carton, or 40 cents a packet. Earlier this week, RJR revealed plans to match this cut on its Winston brand - its leading full-priced brand, and the one that competes most closely with Marlboro - with some other promotional activity applied to its Camel brand. RJR's cuts would apply in June, and be reviewed at the end of that month. The company has already amended a 'targeted stock scheme' - designed to create two separate classes of stock pegged to the tobacco and food divisions respectively - because of the uncertainty hanging over its tobacco division's profitability. The warning came as RJR announced first-quarter profits of Dollars 163m after tax, compared with a loss of Dollars 15m in the same period of 1992. Most of the advance was due to lower interest costs, however, and operating income increased only marginally from Dollars 664m to Dollars 683m. The domestic tobacco division saw slightly lower profits at Dollars 500m (Dollars 512m), while international operations advanced from Dollars 139m To Dollars 159m. The fall in domestic tobacco profits reflected higher unit volume - up 9 per cent - but more sales coming from less profitable 'discount' brands. On the food side, RJR saw operating profits increase from Dollars 189m to Dollars 203m, on sales up from Dollars 1.54bn to Dollars 1.63bn. Group sales in the first quarter were Dollars 3.74bn, compared with Dollars 3.64bn in the same period of 1992. Mr Michael Miles, chairman of Philip Morris, told the group's annual meeting yesterday that if the 40 cents a packet price cut was not enough to regain the ground that full-priced brands have lost to discount cigarettes, 'we are prepared to go beyond that if we have to protect our brand franchise'. However, he was upbeat about long-term prospects, and indicated that a dividend increase might be forthcoming in August.
19930928000000000	FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris in Kazakhstan deal. PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco and food products group, is to become the first foreign company to acquire a significant stake in a privatised enterprise in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, under the terms of an agreement announced yesterday. The company, which already has a strong presence in eastern Europe and Russia, said it had agreed to a deal in which it would gain control of Almaty Tobacco Kombinat, a Kazakhstan cigarette manufacturing operation which employs 1,700. Initially, Philip Morris will take a 49 per cent interest in ATK, with its stake building to more than 90 per cent within a year. ATK's management and staff would hold the rest. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the group said it was committed to spending at least Dollars 200m over the next five years to modernise ATK's manufacturing facilities. Mr Andreas Gembler, president of Philip Morris Europe's eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa operating region, said: 'Kazakhstan is certain to play a key strategic role in the economic development of central Asia.' The group said it envisioned the country becoming a net exporter of tobacco products within a few years. The immediate goal is to boost annual capacity from 12bn to 20bn cigarettes, the approximate number smoked in Kazakhstan a year. Local brands as well as Philip Morris's main international brands - including Marlboro, L&M and Bond Street - are to be produced at the plant. In conjunction with efforts to boost output, the group has earmarked at least Dollars 25m for a programme aimed at improving the quality and quantity of Kazakhstan's tobacco crop. It is hoped that the country will become self-sufficient in tobacco growing by 1998. The acquisition highlights Philip Morris's strategy of broadening the base of its international tobacco operations, which have experienced healthy earnings gains recently, in contrast to its US tobacco business, where operating income has fallen sharply.
19931023000000000	FT  23 OCT 93 / Smoke signals in the east: A look at western tobacco groups' bids to broaden their markets. The Marlboro cowboy may have looked bedraggled and saddle-sore in the US this year but he is still riding high elsewhere in the world. The cigarette brand's manufacturer, Philip Morris, has fought fiercely in the past six months to protect its advertising icon. It is anxious to restore Marlboro's standing in the US. But protecting home sales is not the only motive. It also fears that any further slippage in its standing in the US would hit its growing international business. The emphasis on strengthing an image in new markets is not unique to Philip Morris. As the US, along with other western markets, have turned away from cigarette consumption in the face of health lobbies and government regulation, the multinational producers have had to look elsewhere - such as the Far East - for sales growth. This week came evidence that Philip Morris' strategy is paying off. Its daring decision in April to cut prices in the US by 20 per cent reversed some of the fall in sales over recent years. Marlboro's market share in the US has risen from 24 per cent to 25.7 per cent. More spectacularly, results for the quarter to September showed operating profits outside the US up 15 per cent on the same period a year before. Although the US, where 500bn cigarettes are consumed a year, and western Europe, where 750bn are smoked annually, will continue to be important markets for Philip Morris and other tobacco groups, such as BAT Industries, R J Reynolds and Rothmans International, it is the international market that will provide the long-term opportunities. What has transformed the prospects for the multinationals has been the opening of new markets in Asia and the Pacific Rim and in eastern Europe. A decade ago, 4,500bn cigarettes were smoked a year worldwide. But 60 per cent of the market was closed to the multinationals by trade barriers. Removal of restrictions in the fast-growing economies of the Far East and the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, have now given western multinationals access to all but 5 per cent of a global market that has grown to 5,330bn cigarettes, in spite of recent worldwide recession. Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand, for instance, have lifted trade barriers since the mid-1980s - usually under pressure from a US government that was discouraging smoking in its own backyard. China, the biggest market in the world with an annual consumption of 1,705bn cigarettes, still restricts imports to hard currency outlets, but has said it will open the door wider in 1995. Philip Morris this year signed a co-operation agreement with the state tobacco company to produce Marlboro cigarettes. In Europe, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, tobacco multinationals headed the race by western companies to establish operations in the former communist states, a market of 643bn cigarettes. Such emerging markets present almost a mirror image of conditions in the US and western Europe. In the Far East and east Europe, the smoking habit is spreading and is socially acceptable. Anti-smoking campaigners are less vociferous. Restrictions on advertising are relatively weak or weakly enforced. The contrast between the mature and developing markets can be stark. While a Los Angeles court recently removed a child from the custody of a mother who smoked, children sell cigarettes on almost every street corner in Manila. Whereas in the west, the health hazard is top of people's minds, in Russia's parlous economy the jobs created by the investments of tobacco companies weigh more heavily. Moreover cigarettes have the status of a currency which, unlike the rouble, does not depreciate. Tobacco multinationals are flourishing in these conditions. World sales of international brands, such as Marlboro, grew by 7 per cent a year between 1989 and 1992. BAT, which exported 45bn cigarettes in 1989, almost trebled the number to 129bn last year. US companies shipped 18bn cigarettes to the Pacific Rim in 1985; last year, the number rose to 87bn. To cope with the demand from these markets, Philip Morris is completing a Dollars 400m expansion of its plant in North Carolina, increasing production capacity by 50 per cent. BAT is investing Pounds 175m in its Southampton factory in southern England to double annual production to 55bn cigarettes. The inroads made into Far East markets - where many consumers aspire to what they perceive to be a western lifestyle - is almost certainly producing the biggest contributions to profit, although no group gives a regional breakdown. Philip Morris has secured 12 per cent of the Japanese market, the world's fourth largest. BAT's Kent and Lucky Strike brands both rank in the top five of Japan's best-selling imported cigarettes. The two groups dominate the now growing imported sector in Taiwan. Rothmans International this year merged its tobacco interests in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong to strengthen its operations in the region. Mr Nyren Scott-Malden, analyst at BZW, says: 'The move enables it to use the cash built up in the mature markets of Malaysia and Singapore to exploit the biggest growth markets in the world.' Outside the Far East, slower economic growth mean returns from investments will take longer to secure. Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT's chairman, says significant profits on the group's east European ventures are not expected for at least 10 years, 'possibly 25'. Establishing operations in the former Soviet bloc also requires a deal of management agility to surmount obstacles presented either by the absence of any framework of commercial law or a maze of regulations. 'Businessmen,' says Sir Patrick, 'are marooned in a command economy.' In Russia, BAT is setting up a joint venture with Yava, Moscow's largest cigarette factory; Rothmans is investing Pounds 55m in a joint venture in St Petersburg; and Philip Morris this year bought into its third cigarette company. Other ventures are being set up in the the CIS and other east European countries; in the Czech republic, Philip Morris paid Dollars 400m for a majority of the Tabak company which controls 80 per cent of the country's tobacco market. BAT has gained a 50 per cent share of the Hungarian market through a Pounds 20m joint venture with a local factory. Equipped with modern machinery, these factories are now improving low-priced local cigarette brands. The expectation is that over the next few years, such investments will begin to reap rewards comparable with those in the Far East. All this is not to suggest that the multinationals have given up in western markets. For instance, the breaking of state cigarette manufacturing monopolies, as rules for new market entrants have been relaxed, in Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, have provided further opportunities for international brands. Marlboro now controls 43 per cent of the Italian market and 35 per cent in Germany. Sales of BAT's Lucky Strike brand in France have risen by 27 per cent a year since 1989 to 1.2bn cigarettes. But demand in the mature markets US and western Europe markets is falling under constant and growing pressure of health lobbies and increasing government controls on advertising. The need to keep the Marlboro cowboy looking proud in China and elsewhere will remain the first priority.
19931012000000000	FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: East European buy for KJS. KRAFT Jacobs Suchard (KJS), part of Philip Morris of the US, this week took a further step into the eastern European food market by acquiring 67 per cent of Lithuania's Kaunas Confectionery Company for Dollars 16m. Mr Bernard Huber, KJS vice-president for central and eastern Europe, called the deal 'an important part of our east European confectionery strategy'. The purchase price includes a commitment to invest Dollars 12.5m in the business, which employs 800 people. KJS, which expects total revenues of Dollars 9bn this year and is the third-largest food manufacturer in Europe, has made similar acquisitions in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. The deal marks the second foray into Lithuania by Philip Morris, which in April beat British American Tobacco to acquire the Klaipeda Tobacco Company for Dollars 40m - the biggest western investment in the Baltic states so far. The Kaunas deal repeats a pattern which has marked Philip Morris' entry into other east European markets. Shortly after it bought a majority stake in the Czech Tabak cigarette factory last year, Jacobs Suchard bought Figaro, a confectionery company in the Slovak Republic. Last summer Jacobs Suchard, a confectionery and coffee business which is in the process of merging with Kraft, acquired Dadak, a Czech spice producer. Inexpensive western consumer products, such as cigarettes and chocolates, are in strong demand in the former Soviet bloc. It is estimated that 700bn cigarettes are sold in the region every year. In Lithuania, Philip Morris and KJS have inherited a virtual monopoly propped up by high import duties. Kaunas, the country's largest sweets company with Dollars 10m in total sales, sells 90 per cent of its output on the domestic market. But KJS may want to tap the export potential. Though Lithuania is a small country of 3.7m people, it is often seen as a stepping stone to larger neighbouring markets. By buying local companies, Philip Morris and its subsidiary inherit informal trade contacts cultivated under Soviet rule that may help to smooth any future moves east. Estonia, Latvia and Belarus are the markets closest to Lithuania. But Russia remains the most lucrative - in particular the St Petersburg region, which includes northern Europe's largest city and a population approaching 9m.
19931213000000000	FT  13 DEC 93 / Smoke gets in Europe's eyes: Divisions among EU health ministers and advertisers over tobacco products. Peter Mead is a 30-a-day smoker who thinks tobacco advertising should be banned. He knows it isn't entirely logical, but he feels some degree of reassurance every time he sees a cigarette advertisement. 'At the back of my mind I have to believe the government wouldn't allow something that's going to kill me to be advertised.' Mr Mead is chairman of Abbott Mead Vickers, a top UK advertising agency which refuses tobacco company business. Dominic Proctor, London chief executive of New York-based agency J Walter Thompson, which has among its clients the tobacco company Gallaher, the UK subsidiary of the US company American Brands, takes the rather less exceptional line for an advertising man. 'There should be freedom to advertise anything which it is legal to market,' he says. In Brussels today the arguments which currently divide the advertising industry will be reflected in a debate between European Union health ministers. Under discussion is a European Commission draft directive that would ban all tobacco advertising, apart from point-of-sale material, across the EU. The Commission's action has been prompted by research showing tobacco products cause 430,000 deaths a year in EU countries. Among the middle-aged population, tobacco products are responsible for at least a quarter of all deaths. The Commission also says prohibiting advertising will overcome the problem of differing rules across member states preventing the free flow of, for instance, magazines containing cigarette advertisments. In response, the tobacco and advertising industries point out that the keenest advocates of the plan - France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - either have state-run tobacco companies or allow other companies to operate a monopoly. It would be harder for others to compete against the dominant players in these countries if they were not allowed to promote their products. They also warn that a ban could set a worrying precedent: today Brussels wants to outlaw tobacco advertising, tomorrow it could be fast cars, children's toys, pharmaceuticals or Black Forest gateaux. For the moment, at least, it is likely that the Commission will be unable to persuade EU states to support its directive, as it has been since the directive was first put on the table in 1991. Realising that agreement is unlikely, supporters of a ban will probably not push for a vote today. In the past it has been Germany, Denmark, Holland, Greece and the UK which have blocked a comprehensive ban. Greece, under its new Socialist government, may have softened its stance. But the four remaining opponents have enough votes under the qualified majority voting system to continue blocking its progress. The position of the UK could prove pivotal. It has been the most vociferous opponent of an EU-wide ban and it is widely thought that Denmark and the Netherlands would switch sides if the UK were to change its position. So far the British have preferred a policy of a voluntary approach to restricting advertising and high taxes on tobacco products - the duty on tobacco was increased by 7 per cent in last month's Budget. Tobacco advertisers in Europe believe they have won a reprieve - but no more. Privately, many in the advertising industry see public opinion forcing an end to tobacco advertising in Europe within three or four years. An indication of the mounting pressure of public opinion is already being seen in the UK. The government is expected soon to announce it will be negotiating tighter 'voluntary' controls with the tobacco and advertising industries. Options include an end to poster advertising, a ban on tobacco advertisements in womens' magazines, removing shopfront advertising, and larger health warnings on packs. Proposals along these lines could help to head off the threat of cross-party support growing for a private member's bill introduced by Labour MP Mr Kevin Barron which the government is highly likely to want to block. Such proposals would also provide something for ministers to offer at a European level as an alternative to the proposed ban. The advertising sector accepts that such a move in the UK could presage an eventual crumbling of UK resistance to a EU wide ban. And it is already preparing accordingly even though the European Commission calculates that tobacco advertising makes up less than 3 per cent of advertising for all goods and services in the 12 member states. For example, Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman of More O'Ferrall, the hoardings company which has operations across Europe says: 'The job of our marketing has been to broaden the base of customer demand in all our markets, so that we are not too dependent on one sector.' While there is clearly movement towards further restrictions in Europe, voluntary or otherwise, there is no definitive answer to one question which ought to be central. Does a ban on advertising cut the number of smokers? The Tobacco Advisory Council, the UK trade body, says that the sole purpose of tobacco advertising is to promote competition and encourage existing smokers to switch brands. It estimates that the value of business from smokers who switch is worth Pounds 3bn a year. It denies that advertising encourages smoking. Not so, according to Dr Clive Smee, the department of health's chief economist. Last year he reported that studies of Canada, Finland, New Zealand and Norway, where tobacco advertising bans have been in operation, showed 'a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors'. But his research appears to clash with a study by Michael Stewart, an econometrician, in the May edition of the International Journal of Advertising. That showed a slight increase in smoking in those countries where there has been a ban. A possible reason is that banning advertising also means no health warnings to put off smokers, except on packets. 'This increase is not quite statistically significant, but clearly refutes the belief that advertising bans have appreciably reduced consumption,' concludes Mr Stewart. As he points out, the space now devoted to the health warnings is the 'equivalent of millions of Ecus of ongoing anti-smoking advertising' across Europe. If European health ministers decide that they want to impose a ban on advertisments, they may need to seek some alternative ways of funding those warnings. But the niceties of this debate are unlikely to worry the tobacco companies, although they will continue to lobby vigorously against any measure which could affect sales. The companies already know that tobacco consumption in western European markets is dropping as concerns about the health effects spread and as smoking becomes less socially acceptable. The decline is not sharp - about 2.5 per cent in volume terms in EU countries over the past five years - but it is steady and shows no sign of slowing. In contrast, new markets are opening in Asia and the Pacific Rim, and in eastern Europe, where smoking is gaining in popularity and sales. In China, for example, cigarette sales grew from 1,649bn to 1,705bn in between 1991 and 1992. With such virgin territories to play for, the possibility of an ban on advertising in Europe may ultimately appear to be a a small distraction.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           TOBACCO ADVERTISING IN THE EU: BEING STUBBED OUT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (TV advertising is banned                        Cigarettes per capita throughout EU)                                   per annum (1991)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- France       Banned                                               1,714 Portugal     Banned                                               1,503 Italy        Banned - widely circumvented by indirect advertising 1,691 Belgium      Severe restrictions; total ban in the pipeline       1,681* Denmark      Local radio ban, other controls through voluntary              agreement                                            1,556 Germany      Banned on radio.

19931127000000000	FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris to cut jobs at Richmond unit. Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer group, is to cut the workforce at one of its main US cigarette manufacturing plants by 10 per cent. About 800 hourly-paid workers and 100 salaried employees will lose their jobs at the Richmond, Virginia plant operated by Philip Morris USA, the subsidiary responsible for domestic production of Marlboro, Benson & Hedges 100s, Merit and other cigarette brands. Earlier this week the group had warned that it planned to reduce its global workforce by 14,000 in a restructuring aimed at defending its brands against low-cost competitors. The Richmond manufacturing operation, employing 9,000, looked particularly vulnerable to lay-offs because Philip Morris has faced a severe fall in revenues from the domestic cigarette market following the outbreak of a price war earlier this year. The company said world demand for for US blend cigarettes was growing, and its share of the market was continuing to increase. The job losses will begin in June next year.
19940101000000000	FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: US tobacco group lifts Kazakhstan interest. Philip Morris has agreed to take a majority stake in Alma-Aty Tobacco Kombinat, a cigarette manufacturer in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, according to Interfax, the Russian news agency. The Dollars 310m investment in the operation, in which the US group already owns a 49 per cent interest, underlines the importance of international markets to the troubled US food and tobacco group. Philip Morris would acquire 97 per cent of ATK, while the Kazakh government would retain 'a golden share', the news agency said. The investment includes Dollars 48.9m to acquire the equity, a Dollars 50m bonus to be paid to the Kazakh government, and about Dollars 210m in spending to improve production, tobacco growing and processing. In September, Philip Morris agreed to buy a minority interest in the enterprise and said it would lift its stake to more than 90 per cent within a year. The deal represented the first in which a foreign company had taken a significant stake in a privatised enterprise in the former Soviet republic. The Kazakh acquisition is the latest in a series of moves in which Philip Morris has sought to bolster its presence in foreign markets, which account for a greater percentage of its tobacco revenues than the US. The company has equity interests in tobacco operations in Russia and Lithuania. Along with other US tobacco groups, Philip Morris's domestic revenues have been hit by declining cigarette consumption. Profits from foreign sales, meanwhile, have grown at a faster pace than domestic earnings, partly because of the increasing popularity of cut-price no-frills brands. The investment in Kazakhstan is intended to flood the region with American-quality cigarettes. As part of the agreement, ATK will manufacture Marlboro and other leading Philip Morris brands, as well as local cigarettes.
19940422000000000	FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Net income at Nabisco drops 8% to Dollars 194m. Strong growth in overseas cigarette sales helped RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, compensate for the continuing effects of lower prices in the domestic market in its first quarter. Net income fell by 8 per cent from the comparable quarter's Dollars 210m to Dollars 194m before extraordinary items. The latest figure, however, included a one-time tax benefit of Dollars 20m. At the pre-tax level, profits fell by 11 per cent to Dollars 329m from Dollars 370m Sales were down to Dollars 3.57bn from Dollars 3.74bn and earnings per share, fully diluted and excluding extraordinary items, were down 25 per cent to 12 cents from 16 cents. The figures are the last that will suffer from an unfavourable comparison with quarters preceding last year's so-called 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris prompted a price war by cutting the price of its premium brands. RJR Nabisco said international tobacco volumes rose by 12 per cent, with strong performances in western Europe, the former Soviet Union and Canada. The company planned to start manufacturing in the Czech Republic. International tobacco sales were up 4 per cent at Dollars 727m and operating profits rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 179m. Domestic tobacco volume was 9 per cent lower than in last year's first quarter and sales, at Dollars 1.13bn, were 19 per cent lower. Operating profit was down 21 per cent at Dollars 393m. However, domestic tobacco margins rebounded almost to the comparable quarter's levels. Although its low-cost brands lost volume, sales of its premium brands like Camel and Winston were almost the same, reflecting the company's decision to concentrate on profitability. The Nabisco foods division increased operating profits by 13 per cent to Dollars 230m, with Nabisco Biscuit doing well from new, reduced-fat versions of its cookie and cracker brands.
19940421000000000	FT  21 APR 94 / Showdown in the last gasp saloon: Smokers and cigarette makers in the US are facing unprecedented hostility. You've heard of no smoking offices, no smoking flights, no smoking zones and no smoking days. Now meet the no smoking country - or something well on the way to it. Smokers in the US, and the cigarette makers they keep in business, have never had it so bad. After two decades of relatively ineffectual opposition from anti-smoking activists, they face an unprecedented outbreak of hostility from politicians, government officials, business and the public. In many settings, the expression 'Mind if I smoke?' now prompts the sort of reaction that might once have been reserved for the suggestion: 'Mind if I slay?' So reviled has the habit become that, if legislators and their supporters succeed in their aims, smoking will be regarded as behaviour to be indulged in furtively, if at all, in the privacy of the home, car, or a special smoking chamber. One example of the pressure is a bill before Congress that would ban smoking in all buildings regularly entered by 10 or more people a week, except the home. In effect, this would embrace all factories, offices, bars, restaurants and night clubs - though specially designated smoking rooms would be permitted if they were sealed off from the rest of the premises and had separate outdoor ventilation. That bill, sponsored by the anti-smoking Congressman Henry Waxman and backed by the Clinton administration, is expected to go to a vote in a congressional sub-committee in the next few days. Conceivably, it may fail. But it is only slightly more restrictive than other measures under consideration or already coming into force. The US labour department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is seeking a federal ban on smoking in the workplace. Since bars, restaurants and other places of entertainment are also places of work, they would be included - though, as under the Waxman bill, sealed-off smoking rooms would be allowed. The Food and Drug Administration, another federal agency, has claimed it has evidence that the tobacco industry is adding nicotine to cigarettes to keep smokers addicted. It has asked Congress to rule whether it should start controlling the sale of cigarettes as a drug or, alternatively, whether nicotine in cigarettes should be banned. The US defence department has banned smoking in all military workplaces, ranging from military bases to tanks and battleships. The Clinton administration has also banned smoking in school buildings and health centres. Hundreds of ordinances have been passed by states, cities or local communities banning smoking in public areas. San Francisco, San Jose and other Californian cities have banned smoking in nearly all indoor spaces except private houses. New York's city council has unveiled plans to toughen up existing restrictions on smoking in bars, restaurants and workplaces and to extend them to outdoor areas such as parks, playgrounds and sports stadiums. McDonald's, the fast-food company, has followed examples set by the Taco Bell and Jack in the Box chains by banning smoking in all 1,400 of its company-owned (as opposed to franchised) restaurants in the US. Many stores, shopping malls and sports stadiums are already smoke-free. President Bill Clinton has proposed a 75-cent-per-packet increase in the excise tax on 20 cigarettes to 99 cents per packet to help pay for reform of the US healthcare system. Even this is not enough for some legislators, who are pushing for a tax increase of up to Dollars 2 per packet. These developments contrast sharply with earlier history of anti-smoking activity in the US. Although 30 years have passed since the US surgeon general, the country's chief medical officer, concluded that smoking could cause lung cancer and other fatal diseases, until recently the anti-smoking lobby had found itself outgunned by the tobacco industry. In Congress, cigarette makers could automatically be assured of support from representatives of the tobacco-growing states, such as Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia. But that was only part of the story. Because of the millions of dollars the tobacco industry spent on lobbying and contributions to lawmakers' election campaigns, its political influence extended much further. As a result, the US tobacco industry largely escaped stringent anti-smoking measures. Although health warnings started to appear on cigarette packets in 1966 and cigarette advertising was banned on radio and television in 1969, almost the only federally imposed restriction on smoking was the ban applying to domestic flights lasting fewer than six hours, introduced in 1990; and the federal excise tax, though increased several times, is still only 24 cents a packet. At the beginning of last year, however, two things happened that changed the climate. One was a report from the US Environmental Protection Agency that classified tobacco smoke as a class-A carcinogen and blamed passive smoking for an estimated 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year. The other was a declaration from the Clintons on Inauguration Day that the White House was to be a smoke-free zone. The Environmental Protection Agency report has had far-reaching effects in the US because it has enabled non-smokers to claim that cigarette smoke is not just an irritation, but a menace to their health. It is largely on the back of this report and later ones giving more weight to it, that the US has seen a wave of anti-smoking ordinances aimed at safeguarding the health of non-smokers in public places. Meanwhile, the Clintons' anti-smoking stance has undermined the political influence of the tobacco industry, shifting the balance of power in favour of anti-smoking activists. Could it be curtains, then, for Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, American Tobacco and the other US cigarette makers? Certainly, they are on the defensive. Such is the abuse being heaped on the tobacco industry, and so great the obstacles being thrown in its path, that it is tempting to ask why its executives do not simply give up and try something else. One reason they have not is that, though the US market may be turning ugly, new markets for cigarette exports are opening up worldwide. For example, Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco ship more than 10bn cigarettes a year to the former Soviet Union, adding Dollars 100m a year to sales. The total market in the former eastern bloc countries is estimated at about 700bn cigarettes a year, far exceeding the 485bn consumed last year in the US. The cigarette makers, wary of accusations that they are exploiting ignorance of smoking-related health risks in less developed countries, play down the export opportunities, saying that profit margins on overseas sales are lower than on domestic sales. In any event, prospects in the US may not be quite as bad as they seem. For one thing, cigarette manufacturers still derive big profits from the US market: Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco alone made operating profits totalling Dollars 4bn from domestic tobacco sales of Dollars 15bn last year, even during a vicious price war. As long as that kind of money is available, the industry will fight to the last to defend its market. Last month, for example, Philip Morris filed a Dollars 10bn lawsuit against the ABC television network for broadcasting a programme claiming that the company added nicotine to its cigarettes. There must also be doubts about how quickly the government could move towards total prohibition, if it developed the will to do so. Apart from the political considerations, a sudden collapse in the Dollars 43bn a year spent on cigarettes in the US would leave a big hole in the economy; and a cut in the Dollars 16.5bn a year collected in tax revenue could be even more awkward, especially at a time when government is looking for funding for healthcare reform. Meanwhile, although total cigarette consumption continues to fall in the US, there are signs that the proportion of people who smoke has bottomed out at about 25 per cent, and may even be rising again among the youth, women and ethnic minorities. Moreover, according to Ms Faith Popcorn, a New York marketing consultant, some middle-class adults are sick of healthy living and have started lighting up in a rebellion against political correctness - a trend she calls 'pleasure revenge'. Smokers, it seems, have little to look forward to but vilification. They will also find it harder to find an appropriate or convenient place to indulge their habit. But neither they, nor the tobacco industry, believe they have quite had their last gasp - at least, that is, not yet.
19940621000000000	FT  21 JUN 94 / Welcome back to Marlboro country: Miles's resignation at the weekend is a victory for those who believe Philip Morris means cigarettes. Anyone wanting a simple explanation for Mr Michael Miles's abrupt departure from the top job at Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, at the weekend need look no further than the 40 per cent fall in the company's share price in the last nine months. The heads of many a US corporate giant have recently rolled for less. But the greater significance of Mr Miles's resignation is that it marks a triumph for those within the company who are set on keeping cigarette-making as the group's core activity in defiance of the powerful US anti-smoking lobby. Just 10 years ago, cigarette-making accounted for the overwhelming majority of Philip Morris's revenues. But faced with the prospect of a long-term decline in smoking, it decided to use the cash-flow from its tobacco operations to finance a diversification into the food industry. Under its then chairman and chief executive, the charismatic Mr Hamish Maxwell, it made a series of big acquisitions, including those of General Foods in 1985, Kraft in 1988, and Jacobs Suchard in 1990. By last year the food operations had grown to the size where they were contributing nearly 50 per cent of group turnover (though only 34 per cent of group operating profits). When Mr Miles took over from Mr Maxwell as chairman and chief executive in 1991, he was the first person from outside the tobacco industry to lead the group. As the former chairman and chief executive of Kraft, he had risen to the top from the food side of the business, and some analysts say the non-smoking 54-year-old seemed ill at ease in the role of Marlboro man. He was not made any more comfortable when Philip Morris's US cigarette-making activities started to come under increasing pressure - first, through a loss of market share to low-price competition and second, from the outbreak of an unprecedented wave of opposition from the US anti-smoking lobby. Mr Miles's response to the first threat came in April last year on a day remembered as Marlboro Friday, when he horrified shareholders by slashing the price of Marlboro cigarettes and Philip Morris's other premium brands to win back market share. The move succeeded in boosting sales, but prompted a price war in the US cigarette market and contributed to a fall in the company's after-tax profits from Dollars 4.9bn to Dollars 3.6bn last year. Since then, US cigarette prices have crept up a little and Philip Morris looks set to claw back some of its lost profits this year. But two months ago the corporate boat was rocked again when the Financial Times disclosed that its top managers were considering a plan to hive off the troublesome tobacco operations into a separate company. Some investors cautiously welcomed the idea as a way of relieving Philip Morris's share price from the depressive effect of its controversial association with cigarette-making. But to people who had spent years building up the company in its present form as a food and tobacco conglomerate - notably the retired Mr Maxwell, still a highly influential member of Philip Morris's board - it was anathema. Matters came to a head at a rancorous board meeting last month. After more than six hours of debate - which ranged, it is said, over Mr Miles's performance as chairman and chief executive as well as the merits and demerits of the restructuring scheme - the plan was rejected. Instead, the board promoted Mr William Murray from chief operating officer to vice chairman for world-wide food, and Mr Geoffrey Bible from executive vice president to vice chairman for world-wide tobacco. The significance of this move was that, although both men had spent time on the food side of Philip Morris, both had strong backgrounds in the tobacco side of the business, having joined Philip Morris long before the expansion into food began. As such, they were very much Mr Maxwell's proteges. Their elevation must have made Mr Miles's position even more uncomfortable than it already was. Three weeks later, Mr Miles has gone and the two Maxwell proteges have been promoted again - Mr Murray taking over Mr Miles's role as chairman and Mr Bible becoming president and chief executive. Mr Miles put as brave face as possible on the turn of events: he said he left 'with full confidence that the difficult decisions made over the past two years will be proven right by our results in 1994 and beyond', and added that the recovery of Philip Morris's US tobacco business and the continued growth in international tobacco meant it made sense for someone from the tobacco side to take charge. The triumph of the smoking faction at Philip Morris means that the notion splitting off the tobacco side of the business is almost certainly dead. Yet the US stock market reacted well to the change in management, lifting Philip Morris's share price Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 50 7/8 at yesterday's close. Why? Stock market analysts such as Mr Gary Black at Sanford C. Bernstein, a Wall Street brokerage, say the trouble with Philip Morris was not so much the difficulties it was experiencing with its cigarette operations in the US as a lack of leadership and a decline in employee morale. Mr Miles was a notoriously low-profile chairman and chief executive, declining to face the press and rarely meeting analysts. Investors hope that a new and more aggressive leadership will be better at explaining to analysts and the financial media why gloom about the future profitability of the tobacco operations is wildly overdone - and that this will do more to enhance shareholder value than any break up of the business could hope to achieve.

19940713000000000	FT  13 JUL 94 / Tobacco spurs Philip Morris: Marlboro volumes rise 18 per cent to 99bn cigarettes in three months. Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group that makes Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette, shrugged off strong anti-smoking sentiment in the US and reported a 17.6 per cent surge in after-tax profits to Dollars 1.23bn (Pounds 783m) in its second quarter. It was the first profits increase reported by Philip Morris since Marlboro Friday in April last year, when the company slashed the price of Marlboro and other premium brands in the US to win back market share from cheaper products. Worldwide, Philip Morris sold 18 per cent more cigarettes in the three months to June than a year earlier. Marlboro volumes rose 18 per cent to 99bn cigarettes and volumes of all Philip Morris brands rose 17.9 per cent to 187bn cigarettes. Philip Morris cited strong volume gains in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Korea, Argentina and Brazil. Growth was particularly strong in the domestic market, where Philip Morris increased sales by 21.9 per cent to 57.9bn cigarettes. Philip Morris acknowledged that US gains were inflated by an increase in stocks as wholesalers accelerated purchases in expectation of a rise in federal excise tax. Last year's second quarter, by contrast, had seen stock levels cut; so the industry as a whole had experienced 11 per cent growth in US volumes. However, the price cuts enabled Philip Morris to increase its market share by 5 percentage points to 46.6 per cent. Marlboro's share rose by 6.5 percentage points to a record 28.5 per cent. Although Philip Morris was selling its cigarettes at lower prices in the US, the increased volumes helped lift operating income in the domestic tobacco division by 25.1 per cent to Dollars 858m - seemingly vindicating the strategy of Mr Michael Miles, the chairman and chief executive ousted three weeks ago, who instigated Marlboro Friday. Mr Miles fell out with the board over his support for a plan to lift Philip Morris's share price by hiving off cigarette-making operations into a separate entity. His successors - Mr William Murray, chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Bible, chief executive - have ruled out a split for the forsee-able future. Paradoxically, the food side of the business performed relatively poorly in the second quarter: worldwide operating income rose only 2.4 per cent to Dollars 949m, while operating income on the tobacco side rose 22.4 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn. Philip Morris blamed investment costs in emerging markets and adverse exchange rates. Group turnover rose from Dollars 15.8bn to Dollars 16.4bn. Earnings per share increased 19.3 per cent to Dollars 1.42, helped by share repurchases. Net income for the first six months rose 6.2 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn.
19941019000000000	FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris recovery continues with 27% rise. Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, continued its bounce-back from last year's depressed figures with a 27 per cent surge in net profits to Dollars 1.2bn in its third quarter. In April last year Philip Morris cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes and its other premium brands in the US to win back market share from low-cost rivals. This led to a series of adverse quarterly earnings comparisons which only began to abate in the second quarter of this year. The biggest single component of the profits growth reported yesterday was the recovery in Philip Morris's domestic tobacco operations. Operating income from this division shot up by 40 per cent to Dollars 863m because volumes rose in response to the company's increased market share. The company also saw profit increases in its other food and tobacco divisions. International tobacco increased operating income by 18 per cent to Dollars 800m, international food was up 12 per cent at Dollars 269m, North American food up 6 per cent at Dollars 618m, and Miller Brewing up 18 per cent at Dollars 111m. Overall, group revenues rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. Earnings per share advanced 28 per cent to Dollars 1.42, a touch above the Dollars 1.40 expected by analysts, but the shares eased back Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 in a falling market. Philip Morris said it sold 201bn cigarettes world-wide during the quarter, up 16 per cent from the comparable quarter's figure. Outside the US, the volume of cigarettes sold rose by 19 per cent to 144bn, with growth in most markets except Turkey, where sales were affected by poor economic conditions. In the US, Philip Morris said profits from tobacco had been boosted by the fact that a greater portion of the volume mix came from premium brands. It quoted figures suggesting that Marlboro's market share had risen to a record 29.1 per cent in August, 7 percentage points higher than the period just before last year's price cuts. Mr William Murray, chairman, said he was confident the company would be able to sustain its strong momentum.
19900218000000000	PHILIP MORRIS TAKES HEAT, BURNS BRIGHTER; TOBACCO: THE INDUSTRY LEADER IS GROWING DESPITE A SHRINKING MARKET, BUT MANY ARE UPSET AT THE WAY THE MARLBORO MAN IS LASSOING NEW SMOKERS.. With help from the Marlboro Man, an enormous advertising budget and growing demand overseas, the No. 1 cigarette maker is selling more smokes than ever despite a shrinking market at home. In many respects, the success of Philip Morris USA reflects the scrappy tenacity of the domestic tobacco industry, which has taken an aggressive -- some critics would say hostile and unethical -- approach to selling cigarettes and combating health groups that want to restrict smoking. "There are 55 to 60 million adults in this country who have made the choice to smoke," said Steve Weiss, a Philip Morris spokesman. "What's frightening is that these anti-smoking groups are attempting to impose their own morality on the adult American public by trying to control the information they receive." Philip Morris hasn't been immune to the growing anti-smoking movement in the United States, which has played a role in reducing the market by about 2 percent a year. That shrinkage is partly why Philip Morris USA's New York-based parent, Philip Morris Cos., acquired Kraft Inc. and Miller Brewing Co. years ago -- to protect itself by diversifying. Nonetheless, the tobacco arm of the conglomerate has been strengthening relative to competitors, with weapons that range from intense advertising to lobbying in Washington to a sales assault on virgin territory abroad. Nearly half the roughly $636 million in domestic cigarette advertising in 1989 was spent by Philip Morris, the trade newspaper Advertising Age has reported. Philip Morris held almost 42 percent of the U.S. cigarette market last year, said John Maxwell Jr., who follows the industry for Wheat First Securities in Richmond. The company had a 39.3% market share in 1988, up from 37.8% the year before. Overseas, too, Philip Morris is doing extremely well. In Japan, for example, the company has benefited from a relaxation on imports and a demand for the mild Virginian tobacco it uses, to be blended in Japanese cigarettes. Pavlos Alexandrakis, who follows the industry for Argus Research, an investment advisory firm in New York, predicted that bigger and better-financed tobacco companies such as Philip Morris will get even bigger. "They can advertise more," Alexandrakis said. "They can throw more money behind product development and research." By contrast, Philip Morris' closest domestic competitor, RJR Nabisco Inc., may have little leeway in throwing money at new products, partly because it was sold last year in a record $25-billion takeover financed largely by debt. The one major new cigarette RJR has attempted, primarily aimed at blacks, generated a storm of accusations that the company was contributing to the health problems of minorities. RJR abruptly scrapped plans to test its Uptown brand last month in what was widely seen as a marketing catastrophe. Philip Morris' brands are so self-sustaining that the company is not as pressured to concoct new ones, analysts say. Among the best known are Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Benson & Hedges and Parliament. Of those, Marlboro is king and is the strongest among new smokers. "One out of four cigarettes smoked is Marlboro," Maxwell said. "Marlboro outsells the next largest international cigarette over two to one." The range-toughened Marlboro Man has been an icon of Philip Morris ads since 1955, when it introduced the macho smoker with the butt dangling from his lips. The company has reacted angrily to recent efforts by anti-smoking groups to do away with him. The American Cancer Society, for instance, is promoting legislation to be introduced in Congress this year that would limit cigarette ads to the brand name, the product and text about it. "People are being lured into something that kills them," said Joann Schellenbach, an American Cancer Society spokeswoman in New York. "One in six people that start smoking are going to die from something cigarette related. That's worse than Russian roulette." The surgeon general estimates that cigarettes cause an estimated 390,000 deaths a year in the United States. Weiss said he saw little chance that Congress would further restrict advertising by tobacco companies, already proscribed from peddling cigarettes on television and radio and forced to put health warnings on other ads. "There's a tremendous amount of opposition in this country to tinkering with the commercial free speech rights of any manufacturer," Weiss said. Perhaps more than other cigarette makers, Philip Morris has seized upon the free speech issue as a tool to defend its business. The company even got its name on TV with an ad campaign about its sponsorship of a Bill of Rights commemoration, which some critics saw as a subtle way of promoting cigarettes. Philip Morris has promoted cigarettes in other unconventional ways. At the company's cigarette factory in Richmond, for example, adult visitors are offered free cigarettes and all visitors can write friends on Philip Morris post cards with company-paid postage. The company also writes thank-you notes to visitors who sign the guest register. Hazards of smoking aren't mentioned. Smoking critics have become increasingly galled at what they see as the sleazy tactics used to peddle cigarettes by Philip Morris and other companies. Many say they are particularly angered by subtle appeals to the young. The tobacco industry has agreed to a code that it will not use models under 25 to promote cigarettes. But many anti-smoking activists say the industry subverts that code by using over-25 models who appear to be kids. Others complain that cigarette makers intentionally place advertising billboards in places frequented by children.
