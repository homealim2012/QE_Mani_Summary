19920528000000000	FT  28 MAY 92 / Guilty plea may lead to BNL trial cancellation: Bush administration likely to welcome move. THE long-awaited Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) trial is likely to be cancelled next week following an expected guilty plea by Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former manager of the bank's Atlanta branch. Mr Drogoul is the last remaining defendant facing trial. The cancellation of the trial, which was recently postponed until June 22, is likely to be greeted with relief by the Bush administration, which has come under fire in recent weeks from congressional Democrats. They have accused the government of covering up its alleged knowledge of the more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) of clandestine loans made by BNL Atlanta to Iraq. More than half of the unauthorised loans from BNL were used by Iraq's President Saddam Hussein to fund development of nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects. Ms Sheila Tyler, the lawyer acting for Mr Drogoul, said last night the former BNL manager would enter a guilty plea next Tuesday morning, in a hearing before Judge Marvin Shoob in Atlanta. An aide to Judge Shoob confirmed that Mr Drogoul would enter the plea. As Mr Drogoul makes his statement next Tuesday, a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington will discuss the merits of seeking a special prosecutor to investigate whether there has been a cover-up of US involvement in the BNL affair and other aspects of the arming of Iraq. Ms Tyler is expected to make use of Mr Drogoul's eventual sentencing hearing to argue that he was a minor player in a banking operation that had covert US government approval. Whether this will sway the judge to reduce Mr Drogoul's prison sentence - which could be as high as 30 years - is uncertain. 'It is clear to me that my client was merely a small fish in a larger operation. It is unfair for Mr Drogoul to take all the blame,' Ms Tyler said yesterday. Judge Shoob's only public comment on the BNL affair was in remarks he made at a pre-trial hearing on April 27. 'In reviewing all the documents that have been made available to me, there is nothing that remotely indicates that he (Mr Drogoul) is the sole moving party in this transaction,' the judge said. 'I don't see how Mr Drogoul could have handled this whole thing without some type of assistance.' Mr Drogoul was indicted 15 months ago along with 10 others on charges ranging from conspiracy and fraud to money laundering and tax evasion. The US has no hope of securing four top Iraqi government officials who were among those indicted, while the other defendants have pleaded guilty.
19921114000000000	FT  14 NOV 92 / US closer to special prosecutor for Iraqgate. THE BUSH administration could move a step closer on Monday towards appointing a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing by senior US government officials in the spreading Iraqgate affair. Mr Frederick Lacey, the retired New Jersey judge who has been investigating the issue for the US Department of Justice, has told the Bush administration that he found 'sufficiently specific and credible' allegations to extend his inquiry. Mr Lacey, who was appointed on October 16, made this known to Mr William Barr, the US attorney general, on October 26, a week before the presidential election. But he only disclosed yesterday his desire to extend the inquiry. Mr Barr, who last summer rejected a demand from the US House of Representatives' judiciary committee to appoint a special prosecutor, has been facing uproar in Congress since it emerged last month that officials at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Department of Justice deliberately concealed intelligence reports from federal prosecutors in Atlanta. The prosecutors were investigating the illegal loans of more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) to Iraq from the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which helped Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's weapons projects. Mr Barr will report to the judiciary committee on Monday and announce that he has given Mr Lacey until December 8 to make a final recommendation on whether a special prosecutor should be appointed. . Officials said the deadline would come just a week before the statute that authorises such special prosecutors is due to expire, a law that dates back to the Watergate era. . The US Justice Department has cleared FBI director William Sessions of allegations that he may have broken the law by trying to evade local taxes and making personal long-distance telephone calls from his office, and decided against the appointment of an independent special counsel, the FBI said yesterday.

19930309000000000	FT  09 MAR 93 / Marc Rich steps down and cuts holding. MR MARC RICH, the interational commodity trader, is retiring from the big trading company, Marc Rich & Co, he founded in 1973 and has headed ever since. The usually secretive company said in a statement that Mr Rich would also be reducing his shareholding from more than 50 per cent to 15 per cent within five years. Mr Willy Strothotte, a 48-year-old German who left the Zug-based company last year after what Mr Rich called a 'philosophical difference in management', is to become chief executive. According to the statement, Mr Rich was 'very pleased' that Mr Strothotte was returning. It said Mr Rich's share stake would be reduced to 40 per cent, hopefully within 90 days. 'The management and a number of employees of the company will acquire the ownership which is being transferred.' Mr Rich, a Belgian by birth, founded it in New York in 1973 after leaving the US commodity trading group, Philipp Brothers (Phibro) in 1973 over a dispute about his annual bonus. He soon built it up to a multi-billion dollar business. He said last year it had turnover of Dollars 30bn in 1991, and net worth of more than Dollars 1bn, placing it second only to the US Cargill group among international traders. It employs about 1,300 people throughout the world and has some 200 shareholders. In 1984, in the face of tax evasion, fraud and racketeering charges in the US, he moved to the Swiss city of Zug where the group had its headquarters. He still faces criminal charges in the US. In the same year, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission investigated a loan to the Rich group, and concluded that the loan, secured on a Rich ship, was designed to prevent the US authorities from confiscating the ship when it entered US waters. Evidence of unrest at the group emerged last summer when three senior executives, including Mr Strothotte, left. Mr Rich scoffed then at suggestions of retirement. 'I guess I am a business machine, yet I have been doing this for 40 years. When my original partners retired two years ago the thought went through my mind: 'Should I retire as well?' But it did not take me long to decide I love the business and this is what I want to continue to do.'
19941207000000000	FT  07 DEC 94 / Clinton's friend pleads guilty. Mr Webster Hubbell, former associate attorney-general and a friend of President Bill Clinton, pleaded guilty yesterday to charges of mail fraud and tax evasion for overbilling his law clients. The plea bargain came on charges brought by Mr Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor appointed to look into the Whitewater affair, which involves Mr and Mrs Clinton's investment in a property venture and the failed savings and loan institution run by their business partners. Although Mr Hubbell is a close friend of the Clintons and a former law partner of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the charges against him involve no evident link to the Clintons. White House nervousness over the Whitewater affair has risen in the last month with the prospect of further congressional hearings when Senator Alfonse d'Amato, who has tried doggedly to find some wrongdoing by the administration over Whitewater, takes over as chairman of the Senate banking committee.
19890104000000000	MINKOW AIDE AT ZZZZ BEST GETS 8-YEAR SENTENCE. Mark Morze, the one-time UCLA linebacker whose finesse with accounting ledgers and smooth-talking helped the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company pull off a $70-million swindle, was sentenced Tuesday to eight years in prison. "The integrity of the American financial system is at stake, and I don't think you can just do some wrist-slapping," U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said in sentencing the second of 12 men convicted in the ZZZZ Best case. Morze, an accountant who prosecutors said had a genius for generating phony invoices, ledgers, checks and other financial documents, has been portrayed as the brains behind the fraudulent insurance restoration scheme that bolstered ZZZZ Best's books with up to $43 million a year in phantom revenues.  Senior Vice President Morze, 38, was appointed by ZZZZ Best founder Barry Minkow as the senior vice president in charge of a division that purportedly earned 90% of the company's revenues by repairing buildings damaged by fire or flooding. He was, prosecutor James R. Asperger said Tuesday, a "classic con man" who could persuade lawyers and accountants from prestigious financial firms that the phony insurance jobs were real -- thus bringing in millions of dollars through bank loans and driving up the value of the Reseda-based company's stock. Morze's role, Asperger said, was to breeze in to meet with investment officers, introduce himself as ZZZZ Best's vice president in charge of insurance restoration, then rush off to catch a plane or answer a phone before too many questions could be asked. In at least two cases, the prosecutor said, Morze led financial officers on tours of phony job sites, choreographing every detail to make it appear as though the floor space ZZZZ Best had hastily rented in distant office buildings was actually the site of extensive restoration jobs. "Mr. Minkow had the idea, but he didn't have the bookkeeping skills to carry this thing off," Asperger told the court. Federal prosecutors have estimated that Morze funneled more than $3 million to himself, his family and his girlfriend, of which about $650,000 was converted to cash and cannot be accounted for. Some of the money, Asperger said, went to buy cars, furs, a house and jewelry for Morze's girlfriend.  Amends Cited Morze told the judge he has sought to make amends for his conduct since the day Minkow resigned from the company in 1987. "I immediately felt an unbelievable pressure because it started to become clear, literally within a matter of hours, just what I had done," he said. "I was suddenly barraged with a feeling of remorse, embarrassment and shame." Even before he hired an attorney, Morze said, he began contacting ZZZZ Best board members, notifying them that the insurance restoration work was a hoax and offering to make reparations. He has delivered box loads of financial documents to the government and spent nearly 40 hours in interviews with the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service to aid ongoing investigations, according to his attorney, Anthony Glassman. "I think we have someone who has committed, without question, a major financial offense but who has done everything conceivable to rectify the circumstances," Glassman said. "His testimony really was a road map to and through the finances of this company." Morze has said that top ZZZZ Best officials were planning to carry on the fraud only long enough to complete a $40-million acquisition of a new chain of carpet-cleaning companies. They hoped the deal -- which never was completed -- would enable ZZZZ Best to pay off its debts and begin operating legitimately, he said. But Asperger rejected that notion. "I think his hope that the lies would stop was really more of a self-rationalization," the federal prosecutor said. "His hope that the fraud would be ended was, I think, a pipe dream."  'Second-Tier' Defendant Tevrizian said he was sentencing Morze as a "second-tier" defendant, a man who was more culpable than others in the scheme but who was not as guilty as Minkow. The judge said he was also taking Morze's cooperation into account. "Yours was a youth where you were never handed anything. You had to work for it," he told Morze. "But people go for the home run all the time . . . (and) it only comes one step at a time." Morze, who pleaded guilty to three counts of stock fraud, bank fraud and income tax evasion, will be eligible for parole after serving 32 months of his sentence. Minkow, who was convicted by a federal court jury Dec. 19 on 57 fraud counts, is scheduled for sentencing Feb. 21. He faces a maximum sentence of 403 years in prison.
19900108000000000	CONVICTED BROKER CHARGED IN TAX EVASION SCHEME. A former vice president of a top Wall Street brokerage and 11 others were charged today with using money from an earlier fraud to organize a $1.1-million tax evasion scheme in upstate New York. Mark Stahl, who was sentenced to five years in prison in 1987 for mail fraud at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., and the others were charged with setting up companies that conspired to evade $1.1 million in state fuel taxes, said Nancy Connell, spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. They were charged with enterprise corruption under an organized crime statute that carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail and fines. The alleged scheme involved several companies set up to deliver fuel to the Big Apple and Big M truck stops in the Albany suburb of Glenmont, Connell said. The defendants allegedly bought home heating oil and had it sold as diesel fuel at the truck stops, Connell said. Through this process, they avoided paying diesel fuel taxes, which are much higher than home heating oil taxes, she said. They were also accused of hiding from authorities the amount of diesel fuel they brought into the truck stops, evading still more taxes, she said. Stahl was convicted of transferring more than $1 million in Shearson funds to various bank accounts he controlled in 1986 and 1987. He admitted in court, however, to a much larger scheme involving more than $18 million.
19900111000000000	D. F. BOWLER; SENT COHEN TO PRISON. Donald F. Bowler, the former Internal Revenue Service intelligence chief for Southern California, best known for sending mobster Mickey Cohen to prison on tax-evasion charges, is dead. Bowler, more recently chief of the district attorney's Bureau of Investigation for Los Angeles County, was 69 when he was found dead at his Canoga Park home early Tuesday. A veteran prosecutor and investigator, Bowler was a member of the original federal Organized Crime Strike Force Committee when it was formed in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1966-67. In 1960 and 1961, he directed the grand jury investigation that led to Cohen's lengthy prison sentence for concealing about $400,000 from tax collectors. Bowler entered IRS service after graduating from Loyola University in Los Angeles. He served 22 years and retired to become a vice president of International Intelligence Inc., a private firm, and resigned in 1976 to join the district attorney's staff. When he retired from the district attorney's office in 1981 he was division chief for Southern California. Survivors include his wife, Betty, and five children. A funeral Mass is scheduled for Saturday at 9 a.m. at Our Lady of the Valley Catholic Church, Canoga Park. Burial will be at San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills.
19890116000000000	BRIEFLY. Robert B. Anderson, U.S. Treasury secretary under President Eisenhower, has been disbarred for tax evasion and illegal banking activities. Anderson, 78, pleaded guilty in 1987 to evading taxes on $240,000 in income for 1983 and 1984, and operating an illegal bank in which investors lost $4.4 million. He was sentenced to a month in jail and five months' house arrest, fined $500,000 and ordered to enter an alcohol treatment program.
19890120000000000	FBI PROBES FRAUD IN FUTURES TRADING; INVESTORS MAY HAVE LOST MILLIONS IN MASSIVE CHEATING IN CHICAGO MARKETS. Undercover FBI agents working in the noisy, frenetic trading pits of the world's two largest commodities exchanges have uncovered evidence of massive fraud that may have cost investors tens of millions of dollars. The three-year investigation of futures transactions at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange came to light Thursday as FBI agents served subpoenas demanding six years of records covering millions of trades from the two exchanges and their internal auditing departments. In addition, grand jury subpoenas were served on traders and others connected with the exchange as FBI agents fanned out through Chicago's pricey Gold Coast neighborhoods and North Shore suburbs, beginning late Wednesday and working until dawn Thursday. Traders who did not get subpoenas got the news in headlines in the morning Chicago Tribune.  Up to 100 Targeted Traders, brokers and commodities firms were asked for records, handwriting samples, fingerprints and photographs. Between 50 and 100 persons are believed to be targets of the investigation. The alleged illegal activity uncovered in the investigation includes cheating of investors, manipulating trading losses for tax advantages and possible money laundering. For example, some traders allegedly charged customers more for their contracts than they actually paid for them on the trading floor, and then pocketed the difference. This and other complex schemes were uncovered in the arcane, little-policed, widely utilized financial markets where trades worth hundreds of billions of dollars a day are consummated on behalf of investors around the world. Legal sources said they believe the grand jury will consider charges that include racketeering, conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud and various income tax violations. "The investigation came right out of the blue," an attorney representing a subpoenaed trader said. "No one knew anything about it." Actually, top Justice Department officials had known about it since last Friday, when Anton J. Valukus, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, flew to Washington and briefed Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh on the investigation. Although the inquiry is far-reaching and may ultimately involve tens of millions of dollars in fraud, some Chicago lawyers who specialize in commodities law cautioned that it is too early to compare the unfolding story here to the insider-trading scandal that has engulfed Wall Street for nearly three years. Still, there has been a perception in Chicago that these markets were ripe for a major scandal.  Exchange Called 'Cesspool' Just two months ago, U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen called the Chicago Board of Trade "a cesspool . . . rife with potential corruption and manipulation." Aspen sounded his warning as he sentenced a former trader to six years in prison for a $300,000 trading scam that involved wearing disguises to escape identification on the trading floor. "Problems like these have been with the exchanges from the very beginning," said Robert Tamarkin, a futures market historian and president of Intermarket Publishing Corp. "These markets can only be regulated by having a policeman in each pit. This is an example of the failure of self policing and shows the weakness of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in regulating the pits." Some of the alleged illegal activity was documented on tape recordings made by at least five FBI agents. They wore concealed electronic monitoring equipment as they worked in the noisy, bustling trading pits -- literally depressions in the trading floor -- where all deals are settled by shouts and complex hand signals. The FBI moles were placed in some of the busiest trading areas of the two exchanges. At the Board of Trade, agents worked in the soybean pit, often crowded with hundreds of traders and particularly busy as the result of last summer's drought, and also in the heavily traded U.S. Treasury bond pit. At the Mercantile Exchange, undercover agents traded foreign currencies and the Standard & Poor's Index. The scope of the federal investigation is suggested in the subpoenas delivered Thursday afternoon. The grand jury demanded "all records relating to membership and trading activity for the period Jan. 1, 1983, to the present, including but not limited to trade registry records, time and sales records, disciplinary files and complaints, membership background and financial stock-holding investigation file." The government has asked for literally millions and millions of records. In 1988 alone, at the Chicago Board of Trade a record 143 million futures contracts were traded -- fully half of all futures contracts traded in the world. Last year's volume at the Mercantile Exchange was 78 million contracts.  Exchanges to Cooperate In a notice to its members, the Board of Trade said that it "must and will comply fully with this subpoena." A spokesman for the Board of Trade said he expects federal agents to begin inspecting the data at the board offices as soon as next week. A spokesman for the Mercantile Exchange said it too would cooperate with the investigation. While word of the federal grand jury inquiry swept the trading floors and Chicago's financial community -- second only to New York's in size -- both Justice Department and FBI officials refused to confirm or deny that there was an investigation. "The position of my office and of the FBI here is absolutely no comment," said U.S. Atty. Valukus, who for months has been warning, in public statements, of a federal crackdown on commodities trading fraud. Federal authorities in Washington were also uncharacteristically reluctant to discuss the investigation even privately Thursday, apparently in an effort to reduce the impact it might have on the markets that affect trading worldwide. Still, the investigation made its mark. At the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of a membership fell $35,000 Thursday, to $410,000 from $445,000. And, at the Mercantile Exchange, the price of a full seat plunged $20,000 to $330,500. One lawyer said a client had told him that there were suspicions in late 1987 that the FBI was investigating the Board of Trade. "They didn't know the extent but they knew there was something going on."  Kaleidoscope of Confusion Despite a small army of security men who patrol the floors of both exchanges looking for improprieties, trading takes place in an atmosphere conducive to shady dealings. Together, the two exchanges have over 6,000 traders and hundreds of clerks, runners, telephone clerks and messengers -- all identified by the colors of their jackets. The trading floors are a kaleidoscope of confusion and color in motion. Commodities ranging from soybeans and corn to foreign currencies and Treasury bonds are traded at the two exchanges. A futures contract is an agreement to deliver a quantity of a commodity at a specific time for a set price. For example, if a major grain company believes a drought next summer will raise the price of corn, it might buy corn now for July delivery -- at a price it believes is lower than next summer's price will be. Similar contracts allow investors and speculators to buy everything from plywood and live cattle to soybeans and gold. Although some trades are made with the intention of actually taking delivery of the commodity, most are paper transactions with investors and speculators hoping to make money from quick, minute swings in the market. Commodities futures traders are to Chicago what Wall Street brokers are to New York and what entertainers are to Hollywood. They have a reputation for glitz, living in the fast lane, enjoying the high life. Traders provide the grease that helps run Chicago. Profits earned in the trading pits build restaurants and fuel limited partnerships that erect high-rise apartments and office buildings. Some of the city's most valuable private art collections are owned by traders. Staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington and researcher Tracy Shryer in Chicago contributed to this story.

19900120000000000	IT'S BACK TO SCHOOL FOR EXILED TEACHER. Jean Stapleton's troubles arrived a year and a half ago in an envelope with no return address. Next month, they will end when she goes back to work as a journalism teacher and adviser to the campus newspaper at East Los Angeles College after winning a prolonged battle with the school. In April, 1988, Stapleton had almost completed her 15th year as faculty adviser to Campus News, the student newspaper at ELAC. The award-winning paper regularly incensed school administrators for its critical -- some said biased -- coverage of campus issues. The envelope that initiated Stapleton's ordeal contained a photocopy of the academic transcript of ELAC's student body president. It showed she was enrolled in three units instead of the nine-unit minimum required by those in student government. The next week, the paper published a story with the headline "Lisa Quesada taking insufficient units to hold ASO president post" next to a photograph of the alleged transcript. It included Quesada's explanation that she had been late in adding two classes that didn't show up on the transcript. That story -- which the newspaper later retracted -- would prove Stapleton's undoing. A livid Quesada and school administrators maintained that the article was incorrect. More seriously, they said in a formal disciplinary action that the school paper violated federal, state and college district privacy rules by printing the transcript. For administrators, it was only the latest in a long string of stories that had stirred up trouble. Last May, saying it was "for the good of the school," the Los Angeles Community College District transferred Stapleton to Pierce College in Woodland Hills. The transfer reduced Stapleton from head of ELAC's journalism department to an instructor with five classes. Her commute more than doubled. She was separated from longtime friends and colleagues because, Stapleton said, she exercised a principle she had been teaching for many years: freedom of the press. Stapleton fought back, and in late fall, an arbitrator ruled that the district had no right to transfer her. It ordered her reinstatement effective Feb. 5, when the spring semester begins. Stapleton will return to a different ELAC. Many former administrators have retired or been transferred, bringing once-bitter faculty infighting to an end. Those who remain speak highly of the new president, Omero Suarez. "There's a whole new attitude on this campus now," said Raul Cardoza, ELAC's vice president of academic affairs. Although Stapleton was vindicated, the case raises important questions about freedom of the press and censorship. The debate is especially acute for school-financed campus papers, where students often use investigative reporting skills learned in class to turn a critical eye on administration policies. At Stapleton's hearing, the teachers' union argued that upholding the transfer would create "a serious chilling effect on freedom of the press at ELAC and on academic freedom of all advisers in the district." The district argued that Stapleton was at the center of controversy on campus and that her transfer would alleviate "substantial instability and strife." In the last six years, Campus News has come under criticism for stories about: * Problems in the administration of former ELAC President Arthur Avila, who received a faculty vote of no confidence for what was called poor morale and lack of leadership. Avila resigned in August, 1988, under pressure, according to the Los Angeles Community College District. * The arrest of Hal Mintz, chairman of ELAC's business department, for running a house of prostitution and income tax evasion. Mintz eventually resigned from ELAC and pleaded no contest to the charges. * Avila writing a letter of praise about Mintz to the West Hollywood Business License Commission, which later revoked the license of Mintz's massage parlor. * A $250 phone bill for ELAC's Associated Student Organization that included charges for calls to Acapulco, Mexico, El Salvador and at least a dozen 976-prefix numbers. * Three ELAC professors who held doctorates from colleges that were unaccredited at the time their degrees were awarded. Some faculty members have applauded the paper's coverage. "There's a lot of dirty politics going on at our school," said Daniel Fertig, a life science instructor. "She was doing a good job, but she printed too many hot stories about the administration," he said, referring to Stapleton. But school administrators say Stapleton should have seen to it that the students printed more balanced stories. They say she violated one of the basic tenets of journalism by printing several critical stories without giving administrators a chance to respond. "We believe Jean Stapleton created too much conflict on the campus . . . and that it was in the best interests of the students and faculty to make the change," Jose Robledo, acting vice chancellor of human resources for Los Angeles Community College District, said of the transfer. Stapleton noted that the Campus News won several state investigative reporting awards last year from the state Journalism Assn. of Community Colleges. Her own experience included covering portions of the Charles Manson trials for City News Service. She has been president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. for Women, and has written three books, one on women in management. The administration "thought the newspaper should be a PR piece that said how well the football team was doing and when the band was going to play," Stapleton said. "I was teaching them to be reporters, and that's not always nice." Because of the paper's feisty coverage, Stapleton said, the administration cut its annual budget from $30,000 to $5,000. In October, 1988, a faculty member upset about a story was authorized by Avila to search the newspaper offices escorted by campus police, Stapleton said. Stapleton maintains that Quesada gave up privacy about her qualifications when she became a school leader and that U.S. Supreme Court decisions that give newspapers broad freedom to write about elected officials also apply to campus papers. She likened the Quesada story to stories exposing star college athletes who fail to carry full academic loads. But her arguments didn't sway the administration. In addition to transferring her, it placed the student editor who wrote the Quesada story on probation for a year. A staff photographer was placed on probation for a semester. Some faculty members accused Stapleton of fomenting dissent and using the paper for her own ends. "The campus newspaper should be an instrument of education and not a political weapon as it was in the past," says Ray Ceniceroz, head of the ELAC Chicano Studies Department. Stapleton's students are pleased she is coming back. "Her return will help bolster the department," says Mike Ortiz, editor of Campus News. "She's very supportive; she motivates students."
19890123000000000	LAS VEGAS FIGURE IRVING (ASH) RESNICK. Irving (Ash) Resnick, a longtime gaming figure credited with luring high rollers to the Las Vegas Strip, died Wednesday. He was 72. Resnick died of heart failure at Humana Hospital Sunrise after being hospitalized after a long bout with cancer. His forte was bringing gamblers to Las Vegas casinos for high-stakes gambling, and he organized the first junkets that later became a fixture of the casinos. Resnick's Las Vegas career spanned four decades and included stints at Caesars Palace, the Aladdin, the Dunes, the Tropicana, the old El Rancho and Thunderbird hotels and most recently the Maxim Hotel. He was credited with starting the first baccarat game at the Dunes. Baccarat is now featured at most Strip hotels. In 1974, Resnick was convicted of income tax evasion while employed at Caesars Palace. The government alleged that Resnick skimmed more than $300,000 from Caesars and failed to pay taxes on it. The decision was later overturned.
19900129000000000	'ROBIN HUD' PLEADS GUILTY TO THEFT OF U.S. FUNDS, FEELS 'TERRIFIC'. A Maryland real estate agent, dubbed "Robin HUD" after admitting that she stole millions of dollars in federal housing funds and gave some of it to the poor, pleaded guilty today and said she felt "terrific." Marilyn Louise Harrell smiled throughout the hearing in U.S. District Court in pleading guilty to charges that she stole at least $4.75 million and lied on her tax returns and to federal officials. Her trial was to have begun today. She claimed she had decided to plead guilty as part of a plea agreement because she did not want to spend taxpayers' money in a court proceeding. She pleaded guilty to stealing government property and failing to report income for taxes. As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped two other tax counts, two counts of lying to officials from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and one count of lying to a bank on a loan application. But prosecutors said they still do not believe her story that she gave most of the money to charity. "My assertion that she has been her own biggest charity will be fact" by April 20, the date she is to be sentenced, U.S. Atty. Breckinridge Willcox said at the hearing. Prosecutors recommended a sentence ranging from 37 months to 46 months, roughly three to four years, in prison. The two charges to which she pleaded guilty carry a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison. If convicted on all counts, she would have faced a maximum of 31 years in prison and more than $1 million in fines. Harrell, 46, who confessed to government officials in December, 1988, became a symbol of mismanagement at HUD when scandal erupted there last summer. After her indictment last November, U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the case was the largest ever involving the theft of federal funds by an individual. Harrell went against the advice of her attorney and freely discussed taking the money in testimony before Congress and in several nationally televised interviews. Prosecutors say Harrell took at least $6.6 million from HUD, money generated by sales of HUD properties that Harrell handled as a private escrow agent for the agency. Harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only $4.75 million in HUD funds. And she said that, contrary to the prosecutor's assertion that only a little went to charity, in fact less than 6% of the money benefited her family. Harrell said she hopes to be sentenced to perform community service but regards prison as a chance to get a college degree. "I told the kids (her son, John, and his wife, Vicki) just think of it as Mom going away a few years for college," said Harrell, who will become a grandmother sometime next month.
19900130000000000	'ROBIN HUD' ENTERS GUILTY PLEA IN THEFT. A woman dubbed "Robin HUD" for admitting that she stole millions of dollars from federal housing sales and saying she gave the money to the poor pleaded guilty Monday to federal theft and tax evasion charges. Marilyn Louise Harrell, 46, a former real estate agent from Waldorf, Md., smiled throughout a hearing in U.S. District Court, where she pleaded guilty to charges that she stole money from the Housing and Urban Development Department and lied on her tax returns and to federal officials. "I thought I'd get caught a long time ago," Harrell said after the hearing. "I'm sorry for what I did. I figured I was history and would help as many as I could before I went down." Harrell had originally pleaded not guilty. But she said she chose a plea agreement after new tax evasion charges were added, and to avoid calling poor people to testify on her behalf. Harrell said Monday that she would prove at her April 20 sentencing that she stole only $4.75 million -- not the more than $6 million that prosecutors now say she took in what Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has called the largest theft of federal funds by an individual. Under the agreement, Harrell pleaded guilty to one count each of stealing government property and failing to report income for taxes. In return, prosecutors dropped two other tax counts, two counts of lying to HUD officials and one count of lying on a bank loan application. Though Harrell faces a maximum 13 years behind bars and $500,000 in fines, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gary Jordan said he will recommend a sentence of three to four years without parole. Harrell said after the hearing: "I'm not worried about prison. Some of the nicest people I know went to prison." Federal prosecutors alleged that Harrell, as a private escrow account agent for HUD, raked off the department's money from the sale of HUD properties. Less than $1 million has been recovered, and prosecutors said Harrell would not be able to make restitution. Harrell contended in congressional testimony that nearly all the money went to help the poor. Prosecutors say she was her largest charity, although they acknowledge that she gave some money away. Harrell said she hopes the public and the court will understand that she never bilked the poor, taking only from mismanaged HUD programs. "The program I diverted funds from was not a program that helped the poor. It was property disposition," Harrell testified. Supporters who said they had benefited from Harrell's largess attended the hearing. One held up a giant card, decorated with balloons, reading: "Marilyn, We're Remembering You." Charlotte Chepaitis, who said she runs a Baltimore homeless shelter, said Harrell helped provide incidentals for the facility, but declined to give details. "Jesus said to do your alms in secret, and that's just what Sister Marilyn did," Chepaitis said. "And like Jesus said, she cried out today for forgiveness. Now there are millions praying for her."
19890202000000000	NEWSWIRE. Jim Bakken, former kicker for the St. Louis Cardinal football team, has been given 3 years' probation on his guilty plea to charges of failing to pay enough tax on income from an investment club in 1980. Bakken, now vice president of marketing for Cass Bank & Trust Co. in St. Louis, played for the Cardinals, who since have moved to Phoenix, from 1962-1978. Authorities say the pyramid investment club was an illegal get-rich-quick scheme that flourished in Missouri in the early 1980s. The IRS reported in 1984 that about 465 taxpayers made money in the scheme and that more than $2.6 million in taxes, penalties and interest were underpaid.
19890209000000000	BIG NAMES WHO HAVE BEEN BURNED; CELEBRITY VICTIMS; THE RICH AND FAMOUS OFTEN LOSE OUT IN TAX SCAMS. BUT PROSECUTORS SAY THEY MAY NOT DESERVE MUCH SYMPATHY.. "Show people tend to treat their finances like their dentistry," Dick Cavett said in 1985. "They assume the people who handle it know what they are doing." Cavett was explaining how he had put money in a phony investment scheme that was designed to shelter his income with tax losses. He might have been speaking for people in a lot of other businesses as well. Some of the brightest lights of Hollywood and the sports and business worlds have been caught up in phony tax schemes that have come to light in recent years. Among the luminaries are actors Bill Cosby and the late Lorne Greene, CBS boss Laurence A. Tisch, producer Norman Lear, writer Erica Jong and ex-pitcher Don Drysdale. On Wednesday, prosecutors in New York added some new names: Billionaire businessman John W. Kluge and the late fashion designer Perry Ellis, who prosecutors said were investors in an allegedly fraudulent tax scheme run by Jon Edelman of Rye, N.Y., and Bernhard F. Manko of Lighthouse Point, Fla. The pair were charged in a 32-count indictment. Celebrity victims in other cases have included the late pop artist Andy Warhol, actors Michael Landon, Bill Murray and Sidney Poitier, and Woody Allen and his collaborator Marshall Brickman. The canny businessmen who have been stung in such schemes include former U.S. Postmaster General Preston Tisch and Michel David-Weill, head of the Lazard Freres & Co. investment bank. The sports notables who have seen their writeoffs disallowed includes San Francisco Giants pitcher Atlee Hammacher and Oakland Athletics second baseman Glenn Hubbard. Such luminaries tend to fall victim for some fairly obvious reasons: They have the money to invest, huge incomes to shelter from taxes and a desire to have somebody else handle their tax problems for them.  Tax Rules Tightened "They pass their problems over to the tax attorney or accountant, and he picks the investment for them," said Stuart E. Abrams, a New York lawyer who as a federal prosecutor pursued tax swindler Charles Atkins in such a case. Sometimes, in their eagerness to impress their clients by sharply reducing their tax bills, these tax advisers have led their clients to schemes that promised huge writeoffs. In the late 1970s and through much of this decade, investors could gain such huge writeoffs as limited partners in deals that invested in oil or gas, real estate, government securities or even horse breeding. Though tax rules have since been tightened, these schemes often promised to shelter $4 of income for every dollar invested. Sometimes they sheltered as much as $10 for every dollar invested. In recent years, many celebrity victims turned up in cases that, like the Edelman and Manko case, involved allegedly phony investments in government securities trading. The investors in such cases were customarily told that their money would be used to trade in the highly risky government securities market. They were told that if the trading made money, they would share in the profits; if it lost money, they would reap the tax-loss benefits. In fact, prosecutors allege, the operators of such investment plans have no intention to make money but simply plan to rack up big losses, which they can pass back to investors. Among the cases like this are those Charles A. Atkins, "the boy wonder of tax shelters"; Washingtonian Edward A. Markowitz, and the Sentinel Government Securities case. The celebrities whose names have appeared in connection with these cases have often had the same tax adviser. In the Markowitz case, for example, Allen, his manager Jack Rollins, collaborator Brickman and others became investors because they were using the same accounting firm, the now defunct Bernstein & Freeman of New York. Charles Carberry, the former federal prosecutor who led the government's efforts in the Atkins, Sentinel and Markowitz cases, said such investments often seem legitimate to outsiders because it appears that reputable lawyers and accounting firms have given them their blessings. The crooked firms show their books and operations to reputable lawyers and accountants, telling them they fully intend to try to make money in securities trading. "But they have no intention to -- and they've prearranged trades to ensure they won't make money," Carberry said. In the Atkins case, for example, Atkins' concern had "opinion letters" from the Big Eight accounting firm of Arthur Young & Co. and from the reputable Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter. The celebrities who fall victim in such cases, like other investors, often end up owing huge sums in back taxes and interest but are not charged with any crime. Still, the publicity about their involvement seems to cause the celebrities great grief. In early 1987, after actor Landon was identified as an investor in the Atkins scheme, he called a press conference to denounce then-U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York for releasing investors' names. Landon accused Giuliani of "climbing the political ladder on the backs of innocent American citizens." But some prosecutors contend that taxpayers should suspect the legality of any scheme that promises them $4 or $10 in writeoffs for every dollar of their investment. When he announced the Atkins indictment in 1987, Giuliani was asked about the innocence of Atkins' investors. He said he wouldn't comment on the ethics of what they had done, but added: "I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep sympathizing with their problems." Paul Richter reported from New York and George White from Los Angeles.
19900210000000000	HUNTER'S LAWYERS SEEK RETRIAL, WANT CASE MOVED OUT OF SAN DIEGO. Nancy Hoover Hunter, who was convicted in December on federal charges of tax evasion, deserves a new trial because a jury found her guilty of a phantom tax law, and the judge who presided over her case improperly pressured the jury, her lawyers said Friday. In legal briefs filed with the San Diego federal court, Hunter's lawyers also asked that a new trial be moved to San Francisco. Hunter can't get a fair trial in San Diego because there's been so much publicity about her case, defense attorneys said. Hunter, convicted after an eight-month trial of four of 197 counts, is already set to face a second trial next month on the remaining 192 counts, primarily dealing with fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from her role as a top executive in the failed La Jolla investment firm J. David & Co. Hunter's lawyers contended Friday that she should be tried again on the four tax evasion charges because, after what is believed to be the longest criminal case in the history of the San Diego federal court, she was wrongly convicted the first time. Convicted on Dec. 11, Hunter, 51, a former Del Mar mayor, faces up to 20 years in prison. Immediately following her conviction, U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam ordered Hunter to jail while she awaits her sentencing on March 6. The jury acquitted Hunter of one other tax charge but deadlocked on the 192 counts stemming from her purported involvement in a Ponzi scheme run by the J. David firm from 1979 to 1984. Federal prosecutors alleged that Hunter created false documents both to lure investors to J. David and then to lull them into staying put while the firm slid toward bankruptcy. Investors lost about $80 million in the scandal. The four tax counts involved thousands of dollars that Hunter received from her lover, firm founder J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, but did not report on her personal income tax forms for the years 1980 to 1983. At trial, Hunter said Dominelli, now serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for fraud and tax evasion, told her that she should not consider the money income to her and that he would be responsible for any tax on it. When the jury got the case, "one or two other jurors" told juror John Posey, 44, of National City, that, even if the money from Dominelli was a gift, the law still was that she had to pay the tax on any amount over $10,000, defense lawyers said Friday in their briefs. That was not what Gilliam had told the jury the law was and, besides, it was not an accurate statement because no such law exists, the lawyers said. However, because of what he was told, Posey switched his vote from not guilty to guilty on each of the four counts, he said in a sworn statement filed with the lawyers' briefs. The jury deadlocked, 11 to 1, in favor of conviction on the 192 fraud and conspiracy counts. Posey was the lone holdout. The panel originally was split over those counts, Posey said in his statement. After six days of deliberations, though, Gilliam told the panel that it "should have reached a verdict by now." Though the judge retracted that statement the next day, "the damage was done," Posey said. "I think that jurors who were looking for a way out of the deliberations then saw that the easiest way out was to side with the jurors who were voting guilty," he said. "By the time that Judge Gilliam retracted his statement, it was too late to stop this momentum," he said. Referring to Posey's remarks, defense attorneys said Gilliam's "unwarranted intervention had the disastrous effect of coercing a verdict." In asking that the second trial be moved to San Francisco, the lawyers said the public had been "literally bombarded on almost a daily basis with articles" about the first trial, from last March to last December. Because of press attention, "it is now impossible" for Hunter to get a fair trial in San Diego, the attorneys charged. Defense lawyers told Gilliam before the first trial that it should be moved because of extensive publicity. He denied that request.
19890211000000000	PAYOLA CHARGES AGAINST RECORD PROMOTER DROPPED. A federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday threw out payola charges against a San Francisco-area record promoter and dealt at least a temporary setback to the Justice Department's much-publicized investigation into alleged illegal practices in the recording industry. Responding to a defense motion, U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer dismissed three misdemeanor payola counts against Ralph Tashjian of San Mateo on grounds that the grand jury indictment was not specific enough to allow the promoter to defend himself.  'Distributions of Cocaine' Tashjian had been charged with "making regular undisclosed payments or distributions of cocaine to program directors so the records he was promoting would be added to radio station play lists," according to court documents. Commenting on the judge's ruling, Tashjian's attorney, Anthony P. Brooklier, said: "The problem was, the government charged my client with multiple offenses over a long period of time without specifying the dates of those alleged offenses or the records involved. The judge ruled that the charges were too general and didn't adequately inform the defendant with what he was charged." The prosecutor in the case, Richard Stavin, a special attorney for the Los Angeles Organized Crime Strike Force, said the government will file a criminal information next week charging Tashjian with 200 individual counts of payola. According to Stavin, the dismissal was due to a "weakness in the payola statute," which addresses only specific incidents and "doesn't contemplate a scheme or ongoing course of action." "The judge suggested that Congress may want to revisit the language of the law, which we would urge also," Stavin said.  Tax Evasion Counts Tashjian is set to stand trial, along with his wife, later this month on separate felony tax evasion charges stemming from the payola case. "But the crux of the government's case are the payola charges," Brooklier said. The Tashjians were indicted -- along with another record promoter and a former radio station manager -- in February, 1988, after a two-year investigation by the Internal Revenue Service under the direction of the Organized Crime Strike Force. Charges against the other defendants are pending. In announcing the indictments at a press conference at the time, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner called it the most significant payola case in 15 years.
19900213000000000	PORNOGRAPHY DISTRIBUTOR SENTENCED; JUSTICE: REUBEN STURMAN, CONVICTED OF TAX EVASION, RAN 200 BUSINESSES. HE ONCE REPORTED $1,237 IN TAXABLE INCOME.. Reuben Sturman, described in a 1986 presidential report as the world's largest distributor of pornography, was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison and fined $2.46 million for tax evasion. Sturman, 65, who has a 5,610-square-foot Tudor-style house in Van Nuys and owns another residence in the Cleveland area, was convicted Nov. 17 in U.S. District Court of failing to report $2.7 million in income from 1978 to 1982. U.S. District Judge George White continued Sturman's $1-million cash bond, pending appeals. Sturman also is awaiting trial in federal court in Las Vegas on charges of racketeering and interstate transportation of obscene material. If convicted on those charges, he could be sentenced to 75 years in prison and fined $22.5 million. The maximum penalty in Cleveland could have been 70 years in prison, $2.5 million in fines and $20 million in civil penalties. Prosecutors had asked that Sturman be sentenced to 30 years in prison. "Before this court stands a man who has driven a Rolls-Royce, spent $350,000 to remodel his home . . . and who finally reports an income of over $2 million a year," said Stephen H. Jigger, head of the Cleveland office of the Organized Crime Strike Force. "He has proven crime pays." Sturman's house on a quiet street in Van Nuys, an example of his wealth, sits on a football-field-sized lot surrounded by a five-foot-high fence and iron gates. Sturman's conviction last November set off a scramble among competitors eager to move in on the X-rated territory he dominated for two decades, according to industry and law enforcement sources. The 1986 report by the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography stated that by 1986, Sturman had control of 200 businesses in 19 states and six foreign countries. He started out distributing magazines and putting peep machines into adult bookstores around the country, but moved into the video business when it boomed in the early 1980s, authorities said. The report also concluded that Sturman had close ties to organized crime figures, especially Robert DiBernardo, identified in the report as a member of one, and possibly two, major crime families in New York and New Jersey. White sentenced Sturman to prison terms totaling 34 years, but several of the terms are to be served concurrently. Sturman, who started his business 30 years ago in Cleveland, had been tried several times on pornography-related charges but never convicted. "He stands before you essentially as a first offender," Sturman's lawyer, Michael Murray, told the judge. "As a society, we do not impose life sentences or 30 years in prison for such offenses." The government's case said Sturman hid millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts. In June, prosecutors, defense lawyers and officials from federal court in Cleveland went to Switzerland to interview Swiss bankers. Testimony and evidence showed Sturman hid $2.7 million in income from 1978 to 1982, failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. In 1979, for example, Sturman reported only $1,237 in taxable income. Jigger said Sturman used "the most state-of-art tax evasion" methods and the government probably only learned of a portion of his income.
19900213000000000	METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PORNOGRAPHER GETS 10 YEARS, $2.46-MILLION FINE. Reuben Sturman, described in a 1986 presidential report as the world's largest distributor of pornography, was sentenced Monday in Cleveland, Ohio, to 10 years in prison and fined $2.46 million for evading taxes on millions of dollars in income. Sturman, 65, who maintains a 5,610-square-foot, Tudor-style house in Van Nuys and another residence in the Cleveland area, was convicted Nov. 17 of failing to report $2.7 million in income from 1978 to 1982. U.S. District Judge George White continued his $1-million cash bond pending appeals.

19890215000000000	REFEREE URGES THE DISBARRING OF DEFENSE ATTORNEY DEMASSA. A California State Bar referee has recommended that well-known San Diego criminal defense attorney Phillip DeMassa be disbarred because in 1979 he harbored a fugitive connected with the infamous "Coronado Company" marijuana ring. The recommendation, made by referee Gary Carlin on Feb. 3 and released publicly Tuesday, now goes to a review committee of the State Bar. If the committee concurs, it will be forwarded to the state Supreme Court, which traditionally upholds such recommendations.  Moral Turpitude Denied DeMassa, 43, said he will ask for a new hearing because of his contention that he was not guilty of moral turpitude, the basis on which Carlin made his decision. DeMassa pleaded guilty in November, 1985, to harboring Robert Kent Lahodney for a night in 1979, a week before Lahodney turned himself in to federal authorities. Lahodney subsequently pleaded guilty to marijuana smuggling, conspiracy to obstruct the government in collection of taxes, two counts of tax evasion, and engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. DeMassa himself was a central figure in the government's investigation into the marijuana-smuggling ring, founded by young men who used surfboards to bring marijuana into the United States from Mexico and which grew in sophistication and scope. DeMassa initially was charged by federal prosecutors with involvement in a drug conspiracy with members of the so-called Coronado Company, 60 of whom were ultimately convicted for various roles. During that investigation, federal agents searched DeMassa's office and home and retrieved more than 1,000 of his files. Later, however, an appeals court ruled the search illegal because it violated DeMassa's clients' rights to privacy. But the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego dropped its drug-related charges against DeMassa in exchange for his guilty pleas to three counts of illegal currency transactions and the one count of harboring a fugitive.  5-Year Probation DeMassa was placed on five years' probation and sentenced to six months in a community treatment center. At the time of the plea bargain, DeMassa was barred from practicing in federal court, but it was reported at the time the crimes to which he confessed did not involve moral turpitude. Because of his guilty plea to a felony, the state Supreme Court ordered the State Bar to decide whether he should be allowed to practice in state court. In his 21-page decision, Carlin, a neutral arbiter, concluded that DeMassa be disbarred because "the presumptively appropriate level of discipline for the final conviction of a crime which involves moral turpitude, either inherently or in the facts and circumstances surrounding the crime's commission, is disbarment." Carlin said he could not argue for less severe punishment -- such as a two-year suspension -- despite DeMassa's "lack of a prior record, his good faith, brilliance, dedication, personality and character, and his remorse, contrition and rehabilitation." On Tuesday, DeMassa maintained that he was not guilty of moral turpitude. "Intellectually, it's a wrong decision," he said in an interview. "It didn't take into consideration the realities of ethics."  'Ethically Proper' He said harboring a fugitive "was an ethically proper act, since it aided the justice system. It (harboring a fugitive) is technically a violation of statute, but does that constitute moral turpitude? At some point, someone is going to have to address the ethical obligations of a lawyer when a fugitive comes to you. "If you drive him down the street in your car and you turn right to the airport for the purposes of his fleeing, or if you turn left and take him home for the purposes of turning him in -- either way, you are aiding him," DeMassa argued. During his defense before the confidential State Bar hearing, DeMassa said several witnesses -- including lawyers and judges -- testified that he acted appropriately by allowing Lahodney to stay at his house overnight because the outcome of his decision ultimately aided prosecutors. Among those testifying on DeMassa's behalf, according to Carlin's decision paper, were Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. of the 4th District Court of Appeals, and federal Magistrate Edward Infante.
19890215000000000	NEWSWIRE: NFLPA CHIEF UPSHAW CLEARED BY PROBE. The U.S. Justice Department has closed its investigation of the National Football League Players Assn. and union head Gene Upshaw after finding no wrongdoing. Upshaw blamed the media, primarily the Boston Globe and the Ft. Wayne (Ind.) Sentinel for making "reckless charges" and creating a "trial by headlines." The financial records of the NFLPA and Upshaw have been under review by the U.S. attorney's office since October. The Globe reported in September that Upshaw illegally used union money and tried to conceal his actions. The Sentinel reported in January that Upshaw was about to be indicted on tax evasion charges.
19900221000000000	HUNTER APPEARS IN COURT AS SENTENCING IS DELAYED. Nancy Hoover Hunter made her first public appearance Tuesday since she was sent to jail without bail in December, looking wan but calm in court as she heard her formal sentencing on four counts of tax evasion put off for two weeks. In a two-minute hearing, U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam formally postponed Hunter's sentencing until March 6 to give the agency preparing sentencing recommendations more time. Hunter appeared in court for about a minute, wearing a khaki jail-issue jumpsuit and blue sneakers. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, held by a pink elastic band. Hunter, 51, a former Del Mar mayor, conferred several times in a whisper with her defense lawyer, Robert Brewer, but did not say anything to Gilliam. After an eight-month trial, Hunter was convicted Dec. 11 of four of 197 counts. Gilliam immediately ordered her to await sentencing without bail at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego. The charges against Hunter stem from her role as a top executive at the failed La Jolla investment firm J. David & Co., from 1979 to 1984. Prosecutors allege that Hunter created false documents to lure investors to J. David and then to lull them into staying put while the firm slid toward bankruptcy. About 1,500 investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, a Ponzi scheme in which money from new investors was used to pay off earlier investors and little actual trading was done. Hunter's ex-lover, firm founder J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, pleaded guilty in 1985 to fraud and tax evasion in connection with the Ponzi scheme and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison. The jury that convicted Hunter also acquitted her of one other tax charge, but deadlocked on 192 other counts, primarily fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from her role at J. David. Prosecutors have said they intend to go to trial again next month on the 192 counts. Defense lawyers Brewer and Richard Marmaro have asked for a retrial on the four tax evasion counts, claiming the jury found Hunter guilty of a phantom tax law and that Gilliam improperly pressured the jury. The judge said Tuesday that he will consider that request March 6. At a hearing today, Marmaro is due to report to Gilliam about whether he will remain Hunter's lawyer. Last week, he asked for time to "make adequate arrangements," apparently financial, so he can stay on the case. Once Hunter's new trial ends, with or without the four tax evasion charges, Hunter faces yet another trial, again stemming from the J. David affair.
19890303000000000	JUDGE GIVES 10-YEAR PRISON TERM TO ORGANIZER OF BOGUS TAX SHELTERS. A Huntington Beach tax adviser who orchestrated a bogus, multimillion-dollar tax shelter scheme drew a 10-year prison term Thursday, maintaining until the end that he didn't realize that he was doing anything wrong. "I should have known better. I didn't," 68-year-old Charles D. Spurrier told a federal judge just before his sentence. "I'm just what I say I am -- just an ordinary guy who can't see how I got myself into this." But U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts drew a different portrait of the gray-haired Mormon as about four dozen relatives of Spurrier and his six co-defendants in the tax scheme listened in silence in a Santa Ana courtroom. "These crimes are heinous crimes," Letts declared as he railed against what he described as a tolerance on the part of some judges to white-collar crime. On the one hand, the judge said, "this was a scheme calculated to help criminals achieve their objective without criminal risk." On the other, he added, Spurrier duped "gullible victims" who believed that they were joining a legitimate tax-shelter program. Spurrier was convicted by a federal jury in December of tax evasion, fraud and helping others file false income statements. With associates in his Trust Management Group, Spurrier attracted 5,800 people into bogus and illegal tax shelters. One of his major operations took in $11.2 million in clients' income, then returned $10.1 million of that total in nontaxable "gifts" and kept a fee for the company. Spurrier maintained throughout his trial that he did not realize what he was doing was illegal and pointed as a defense to his deep religious beliefs. He and his attorney, William A. Dougherty, maintained that Spurrier was convinced of his operation's legitimacy by the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But the jury did not believe him. Spurrier faces a maximum possible sentence of 39 years in prison and a $50,000 fine. Letts handed out a sentence that fell short of the maximum but exceeded the recommendation of probation officials. He declined to impose a fine against the now-penniless Spurrier to go along with his 10-year prison term. The six other family members and associates implicated in the tax scheme each received lesser sentences, ranging from a month in jail to several years in prison. Federal prosecutor John C. Belcher said he found Letts' sentence to be fair but somewhat lenient -- especially in light of the sharp rebuke against white-collar crime delivered by the judge just before sentencing. "He prepared everybody for very tough sentences, but it didn't really end up that way," Belcher said. Spurrier, who remained free on bond, said in an interview after the judge's decision: "I think it's a fair sentence. I expected to do better, but I have no complaints. I'm not discouraged, and I'm not frightened." Earlier, in a pre-sentencing statement to the judge, Spurrier continued to claim innocence, but added: "I'm not pleading for mercy or anything else." Letts said he would give him none, adding that crimes in pursuit of money are among the most dangerous to society. Of the defendants' assertions that they were ignorant of their wrongdoing, the judge said, "It is not uncommon for people committing a fraud to have a very high capability for self-delusion, as well as the ability to defraud others." Also sentenced Thursday on a variety of tax-fraud-related charges were: Spurrier's son, Dennis C. Spurrier, 34, to 3 years in prison and 5 years' probation; Spurrier's nephew Wayne Hill, 34, to 30 days in jail, 5 years' probation, a $2,000 fine and community service, and Spurrier's nephew Leon G. Hill, 44, to 3 years in prison, 5 years' probation and an $8,000 fine. Also sentenced were Thomas R. Smith, 37, who was given 6 months in prison and 5 years' probation; Hyrum J. Amundsen, 75, given 3 years in prison and 3 years' probation, and Amundsen's wife, Eva, 64, given 30 days in jail, 5 years on probation and community service. All the defendants remained free on bond pending appeals. In taking the case to a higher court, defense lawyers plan to argue, in part, that the prosecution was tainted by information that one juror gained from outside the trial.
19900307000000000	J. DAVID EXECUTIVE GETS 10-YEAR TERM FOR EVADING TAXES. Nancy Hoover Hunter, convicted of four counts of tax evasion in connection with the J. David & Co. investment fraud, was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in federal prison. Hunter, 51, a former top executive with the failed La Jolla investment firm, begged U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam for mercy, crying and holding on to a lectern for support as she said she was "terribly sorry for all the pain and suffering I've caused." Hunter's attorneys had pleaded with Gilliam to view her conviction apart from the complicated J. David fraud, which bilked about 1,500 investors of about $80 million from 1979 to 1984. But Gilliam said the case was "a little more than an income-tax violation case." The judge added, "We have in this case the motive, the extravagance and, uppermost, the people who were hurt." Gilliam, who could have sentenced Hunter to 20 years in prison, added a five-year probation term after the 10-year prison sentence concludes. But he did not impose a fine. The judge said he was not ready to consider when Hunter would be eligible for parole. The giant J. David fraud involved a Ponzi scheme in which money from new investors was used to pay off old investors and little actual trading was done. Prosecutors allege that Hunter created false documents to lure investors to J. David and then to lull them into staying put while the firm slid toward a bankruptcy that was declared in February, 1984. Hunter's former lover, firm founder J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, pleaded guilty in 1985 to fraud and tax evasion in connection with the scheme and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison. A jury convicted Hunter Dec. 11 of the four tax counts -- out of 197 total charges. It acquitted her of one other tax charge but deadlocked on 192 other counts, primarily fraud and conspiracy stemming from her role at J. David. The tax charges involved nearly $2 million that Hunter failed to report on her personal income taxes for the years 1980 through 1983, evading nearly $1 million in taxes. At the trial, Hunter said Dominelli had assured her he would take care of any tax. Prosecutors have said they intend to go to trial again on the 192 counts. A May 1 trial date has been set. When the second trial ends, Hunter faces yet another trial on securities violations connected to the J. David case.
19900307000000000	LAWYERS TOLD TO NAME CLIENTS WHO PAID CASH. The Internal Revenue Service has served summonses on criminal defense attorneys around the country demanding that they reveal the names of clients who paid their fees with cash, an IRS official confirmed Tuesday. Lawyers argue that such disclosures would violate the fundamental right of attorney-client privilege. The attorneys were told to bring their financial records to IRS offices, said Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, president of the National Assn. of Criminal Lawyers. One lawyer served said an IRS agent told him that 900 lawyers were to receive summonses. "We have heard from enough lawyers around the country to recognize that it appears to be a nationwide assault upon criminal defense lawyers," Sonnett said. In October, the IRS sent letters to about 940 criminal defense attorneys requesting information on clients who paid them more than $10,000 in cash, Sonnett said. The letters, signed by Christopher J. Lezovich, an IRS official in Detroit, was sent to attorneys around the country giving them 30 days to identify the clients. It also included a warning that non-compliance would result in summonses. Lezovich confirmed Tuesday night that summonses had been issued. The IRS is acting under a disclosure law passed by Congress in 1985. The law, initially widely ignored, was aimed at exposing tax evaders, including major drug dealers who often transact business in cash.
19900307000000000	LOCAL; OFFICER ADMITS DRUG SCAM. Los Angeles County Sheriff Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, the central figure in a money skimming scandal, pleaded guilty today to a federal conspiracy charge and admitted his role in the alleged theft of seized drug money. Sobel, 45, also pleaded guilty to a single count of filing a false income tax return and has agreed to cooperate with government prosecutors. Nine other veteran narcotics officers have pleaded not guilty to charges that they participated in the theft of more than $1.4 million in seized drug cash. The wife of one of the deputies was also indicted on charges that she helped disguise the stolen money in various bank accounts. She also pleaded not guilty.
19890310000000000	FRAUD FIGURE CONFESSES PAYING BRIBE TO PAISLEY; GUILTY PLEA IMPLICATING FORMER ASSISTANT NAVY SECRETARY SEEN AS BREAKTHROUGH IN DEFENSE PROBE. In a major breakthrough in the Pentagon fraud case, a former vice president of the Unisys Corp. pleaded guilty Thursday to bribing then-high-ranking Navy official Melvyn R. Paisley to win multimillion-dollar Defense Department contracts. The executive, Charles F. Gardner, admitted that he had directed an associate in 1986 to use company funds to buy Paisley's Sun Valley, Ida., condominium at an inflated price in return for preferential treatment on Navy and Marine Corps business. A guilty plea entered by the Gardner associate, James G. Neal, a Unisys consultant, implicated a previously unnamed sixth Pentagon official in wrongdoing. The official is retired Navy engineer Garland Tomlin Jr. When serving in the Pentagon, according to Neal's plea, Tomlin received $400,000 in bribes directed by Gardner. The new pleas provide prosecutors with their strongest evidence to date implicating Paisley in the massive fraud case. Paisley, a former assistant secretary of the Navy who later became a successful defense industry consultant, is the highest-ranking target of the 2 1/2-year investigation. His lawyer strongly denied any wrongdoing by Paisley. Gardner's plea agreement, which included a pledge to cooperate with the government, gives prosecutors a potential star witness to testify against other defendants when cases produced by the extensive investigation come to trial. "These are significant developments," said U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson, who has been directing the investigation from his office in Alexandria, Va. "The cooperation we get . . . from individuals will advance the case substantially." However, the government's willingness to strike a plea bargain with Gardner shocked some people close to the inquiry. "I can't believe it," one defense lawyer said. "This sounds like a desperation move." As a government target, Gardner, a highly placed corporate officer associated with many of the figures under investigation, was believed to rank in priority only behind Paisley and influential consultant William M. Galvin. However, Thursday's pleas also implicate Galvin in alleged bribery, saying that he advised Gardner to offer Paisley the inflated condominium price. Under the agreement entered in federal court in Alexandria, Gardner pleaded guilty to one count of bribery of a public official, one count of conspiracy to commit bribery and one count of tax fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of 18 years and a $750,000 fine. Sentencing was postponed until July, apparently to allow him to assist the government in the investigation. Lawyers for Galvin and the Unisys Corp., as well as Paisley, denied that their clients were guilty of wrongdoing.  Denial by Paisley "Mr. Paisley unequivocably rejects the contention that he was bribed by Charles Gardner or anyone else while at the Navy," his lawyer, E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., said. "Mr. Paisley had no knowledge that the sale of his condominium was anything other than a completely legitimate, arms-length transaction" at fair market price. William Nussbaum, an attorney for Galvin, said, "Any allegation that Mr. Galvin bribed a government official or participated in a conspiracy to bribe a government official is absolutely false." A spokesman for Unisys said that the company had been unaware of Gardner's criminal activities. The spokesman noted that those activities had begun when Gardner worked for Sperry Corp., which was acquired by Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys in November, 1986. Gardner was forced by the company early last year to retire as a vice president and general manager of its Fire Control and Surveillance Division in Great Neck, N. Y.  'Disguised' Payoffs The payoffs were "disguised by a small group of former Sperry employees and consultants . . . " spokesman Peter Hynes said. "Gardner's crimes were rooted in premerger practices that the new company helped find and eradicate." All of Gardner's Sperry superiors have left Unisys since the merger, and 38 former Sperry employees have been dismissed or otherwise disciplined, Hynes said. In addition to his admission that he had bribed Paisley, Gardner admitted Thursday that he used company money to establish a slush fund for campaign contributions to Rep. Roy Dyson (D-Md.), former Rep. Bill Chappell Jr. (D-Fla.) and others with influence over the defense procurement process. His admission, in which he said he had directed Unisys subordinates and defense consultants hired by the firm to make the contributions, confirmed an account contained in a guilty plea entered in January by former Unisys executive Robert D. Barrett and former consultant Joseph E. Hill. Abbe Lowell, a lawyer who represents both Dyson and Chappell, reiterated that the congressmen did not know the money was tainted. The two, and other congressmen reported to have received illegal campaign funds, have pledged to return them.  Faces Up to 15 Years Neal, 63, who said he paid Paisley $149,000 for a condominium that was worth only $100,000, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, one count of conspiracy to defraud the government and one count of tax evasion. He faces a maximum penalty of 15 years and a $750,000 fine. Also pleading guilty was Galvin's stepson, Kenneth F. Brooke, 40, who had worked for Galvin as an accountant. Brooke promised to testify against his stepfather and pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion. He faces a maximum penalty of five years and a $250,000 fine. The pleas indicated that Gardner, while presiding over Unisys' Great Neck division, supervised a network of associates that paid off Pentagon officials and contributed illegally to congressional campaigns in an effort to obtain further Defense Department business for Unisys. The net effect, Gardner admitted in the court documents, was that many of Pentagon contracts at his division "were obtained or maintained through the use of bribes and illegal campaign contributions." According to an account that both Gardner and Neal swore to be true Thursday, the two bribed Paisley in August, 1986, with the condo purchase and sold the unit the next year for only $100,000. From 1981 to 1987, Paisley oversaw contracts awards for the Navy as assistant secretary. In return, they said they sought Paisley's help in steering to Unisys multibillion-dollar contracts as the Navy's second source for production of the Aegis shipboard defense system and a multimillion-dollar contract to produce the Marine Air Traffic Control and Landing System. Both contracts ultimately were awarded to Unisys. The Times reported last summer that Paisley in June, 1986, abruptly revised the bidding rules for the Aegis contract in a way that favored Unisys. Thursday's admissions disclosed that Gardner and Neal took elaborate precautions to disguise the source of the payment to Paisley, which they said they made at the recommendation of Galvin, whose close ties to Paisley were well-known in the defense community. Under instructions from Gardner, the documents show, Neal deposited more than $150,000 in Unisys money into an account on Britain's Isle of Man, which has secretive banking laws. He then transferred those funds to his own Bahamian-based company, Surrey Investments, and finally passed that money through a third firm, Pathway Investments, to buy the Idaho condominium. Neal said he had bribed the other Pentagon official, former Naval Electronics Systems engineer Tomlin, after Tomlin told Gardner that he would use his influence to help Gardner's company obtain an unspecified multimillion-dollar Navy contract in return for a $500,000 payment. Neal said that, at Gardner's direction, he had transferred 18 separate payments totaling $400,000 to Longwood International, a Bahamian company owned by Tomlin. It could not be learned to whom the contract ultimately was awarded.  Resigned From Navy A Navy spokesman said that Tomlin, a top-ranking civil servant, resigned from the Navy in October, 1985. Neither Tomlin nor his attorney could be reached for comment. Gardner also profited enormously from the transfer of the Unisys funds. According to the pleas, a total of $1.7 million paid to Neal under his consulting contracts with Unisys ultimately was transferred to AVC Associates, a company Gardner had established without the knowledge of his superiors. The Unisys spokesman said the company planned to take legal action against Gardner to recover the funds.
19890310000000000	MYSTERIOUS TARGET OF FRAUD PROBE SHOT DEAD AT ESTATE. A former California Highway Patrol officer, under investigation for tax fraud in connection with four Los Angeles nude and topless bars, was killed in a hail of gunfire early Thursday as he arrived at the gate of his remote Orange County home in his chauffeured limousine. Horace Joseph McKenna, 46, was killed only hours after Los Angeles Superior Court records were made public detailing the Los Angeles County district attorney's investigation of him and a suspected business partner, Michael Woods, also a former CHP officer. The documents identified several people associated with both men. "Judge J.D. Smith released (the court records) yesterday. The thing goes down today. You can draw your own inferences," district attorney's spokesman Andy Reynolds said Thursday. McKenna, a body builder whose sprawling Brea estate reportedly was sometimes guarded by men with machine guns, died instantly in the gangland-style ambush at 12:30 a.m., Brea police said. The shooting broke out as McKenna's chauffeur, Bob Berg, 42, was returning to the car after unlocking the gated entrance to the estate, known as "Tara Ranch," in the 6200 block of Carbon Canyon Road, police and employees at the ranch said. McKenna, a hulking 300-pound man who had been asleep in the car, died of numerous gunshot wounds, possibly from automatic or semi-automatic weapons, police said. The motive was unknown and no suspects were in custody. It was not clear, according to police accounts, how Berg escaped the gunfire. Unhurt, he drove the limo to the house, a mile and a half up a winding driveway, immediately after the shooting and notified authorities. Reached by phone Thursday night, Berg, his voice trembling, said he would have no comment "until I talk to a lawyer. I don't want to talk about it, I've had enough." Berg was identified in court documents as one of the alleged conspirators in the tax case. Late Thursday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office released investigators' search warrant affidavits that had been unsealed in court Wednesday at the request of McKenna's attorney, Michael Nasatirs. The 300-page document named several associates of Woods and McKenna, including at least eight who allegedly conspired with them to hide profits and skim money. The warrants identified McKenna and Woods as the alleged hidden owners of several nude and topless bars in the Los Angeles area. Several law enforcement agencies -- including Los Angeles and Long Beach police, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and the FBI -- had monitored McKenna and Woods' suspected hidden interests in the bars, as well as alleged illegal gambling, narcotics and prostitution activities, according to the documents. Investigators said in the warrants that the two men "have maintained associations with terminated, retired and currently employed law enforcement officers, thus making this investigation extremely sensitive. Authorities had no comment on the whereabouts of Woods Thursday.  Extravagant Life Style "McKenna appears to live a life style," investigators wrote, "which apparently exceeds his reported income." For example, when McKenna and a girlfriend rented an apartment in El Segundo in 1987, they noted, McKenna listed his annual gross income as $44,431. The Brea property, purchased in February, 1986, cost $825,000 and investigators estimated mortgage payments to be $70,000 per year. In addition, they said, McKenna employed groundskeepers to maintain the horse training track at his "Gone With the Wind Arabian Horse Stables," a western movie set, grounds and residence. "Both estimated monthly payments and employment costs well exceeds McKenna's reported income of $44,431 . . . and strongly suggests that the McKennas were involved in a fraudulent loan application scheme or received funds from unreported income," investigators said. Sherry McKenna, McKenna's former wife, has no other source of income, they added. Los Angeles County authorities said Thursday that they were close to filing charges against Horace McKenna, who records showed had a criminal history -- including a federal conviction for conspiracy to counterfeit in 1976, a Los Angeles conviction for assault with a weapon in a San Pedro Bar in 1982, and a record of arrests for running what was described as a large prostitution ring in 1975. A native of New Orleans, McKenna joined the CHP in June, 1968, working generally in West Los Angeles until he resigned in June, 1972, a CHP spokesman said. On April 14, 1976, McKenna surrendered to sheriff's deputies investigating what they said was a prostitution ring centered in the Inglewood and Lennox areas. McKenna, deputies said, was the suspected kingpin of the ring. They linked McKenna and the prostitution operation to establishments called "The Institute of Oral Love," "Sexual Relief Center" and "Wild Mary's." The outcome of that case was not known Thursday. McKenna was sentenced to six years in prison in the counterfeiting case, but it was not known Thursday how much time he served. On Thursday night, at the New Jet Strip in Lennox -- one of the bars in which McKenna allegedly was a secret owner -- a woman bartender remarked: "What a weird night to be working. I didn't think we would be working tonight." She elaborated: "Because the owner was killed last night. He was all over the news." When asked for more information about McKenna, the woman declined and refused to give her name. "I can't talk about it," she said. "I'm too upset." At 6-foot-5, McKenna was known as "Mac or Big Mac or just Big," said associates, who described him as a flamboyant and mysterious character who kept exotic animals on his ranch, where he also often entertained nightclub dancers. According to Sherry McKenna's attorney, Richard Debro, she feared for her life because her former husband had threatened to kill her. He said his client has been in hiding. The attorney said McKenna "used drugs and became incredibly violent." "I've seen her after she had been beaten up (by McKenna), the black eyes, things like that," Debro said. "The law didn't mean anything to him. "She said she had no doubt in her mind that he would kill her, or have her killed" if she insisted on fighting their divorce settlement, the attorney said. "He had threatened to kill her with a gun to her head." Neither Bill Gray, 42, owner of a gym in Brea where McKenna worked out, nor other friends and associates contacted Thursday had any idea who would have wanted to kill him. They described McKenna as a big, lovable man who was building a Shangri-La on his ranch for the pleasure of friends and their families. "There wasn't a mean bone in his body," Gray said. "He would take people's kids up (to the ranch) and give them horseback rides." Since buying the property, McKenna had stocked the ranch with prize Arabian show horses -- some worth as much as $20,000, friends said. He remodeled the property's sprawling, ranch-style home, installed a swimming pool and rose garden and was in the process of completing an Old West-style "ghost town," complete with "Main Street" and facades of a saloon, blacksmith shop and bank, they said. Mike Tutty, 31, a longtime friend of McKenna and a member at the 4 Star Gym in El Segundo, which KcKenna owned, described him as "a very intimidating person. . . . "He was a person who commanded attention. He wanted people to know who he was. He had a big ego and he needed fodder for that ego. And he pretty much got it." Moreover, Tutty said, "he liked the ladies, there's no doubt about it. He was very gracious to the ladies." According to Dana Sermas, one of several woman horse trainers McKenna employed, he often entertained friends and business associates by taking them on horseback rides and giving them "guided tours of his 'ghost town.' " McKenna also regularly entertained a group of young women whom he laughingly referred to as "his bimbos," because they worked as dancers at nightclubs in the Los Angeles area, according to Sermas and Ingrid Locken, another horse trainer. Both women said they were under the impression that the clubs featured topless or nude dancing, and they added that the women whom McKenna brought to the ranch "dressed in sleazy outfits." Pete Cahill, 35, another member of the El Segundo gym, described McKenna as "the most lovable gangster in the world. If he was a gangster, I guess that's the way you've got to go." Cahill said that at the club it was understood that McKenna "owned a lot of topless places. It was an unspoken thing everybody knew but nobody talked about it." Sermas said McKenna was in the process of installing an electronic gate at his home so the chauffeur would not have to get out of the limousine every time they entered. She said the gate was about to be hooked up by utility crews. While police tried to piece together details of the slaying, one neighbor said she thought nothing when three visitors came to McKenna's home on Wednesday night, although now it seems ominous. About 6:55 p.m., the neighbor said, she watched three people, one with a flashlight, "going over the fence." Police would not immediately comment on the woman's statement or other details of the case. Times staff writers Richard Beene, Jim Carlton, Dianne Klein, Eric Lichtblau and Nancy Wride in Orange County, and Richard Colvin, Hector Tobar, Boris Yaro and Sebastian Rotella in Los Angeles contributed to this article.
19890310000000000	OWNER OF IMMIGRATION FIRMS HELD ON TAX EVASION CHARGES. An El Toro businessman already under investigation for allegedly defrauding Spanish-speaking immigrants seeking work papers was arrested Thursday on 12 felony counts of tax evasion, authorities said. Oscar Salinas, 51, owner of one of Southern California's largest immigrant legalization services, was taken into custody at his El Toro home Thursday morning and placed in Orange County Jail. Bail was set at $250,000 and an arraignment was scheduled for today. Deputy Dist. Atty. Gerald G. Johnston said Salinas, who also uses the name Jan Vouziers, was charged with eight counts of failure to pay payroll taxes for his employees and four counts of failure to file 1987-88 state income tax returns for his employees. Salinas is the owner of one of the region's largest immigrant assistance companies, with offices in Orange, Los Angeles, San Diego and Ventura counties. Critics, including the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights, have long complained that Salinas' companies, which operate under different names, are guilty of sloppy and incomplete work in handling and processing residency and work applications for thousands of Spanish-speaking immigrants. Johnston said his office has been investigating Salinas for more than 6 months in connection with complaints that he has lured immigrants to his businesses by making false promises of providing amnesty, residency or temporary work permits. "I'd estimate he has about 5,000 clients," Johnston said. "Depending on the program, it is very expensive. It can be up to $2,500 apiece for labor certification, and we think that there are about 2,000 people there." Johnston added that "there have been a number of complaints that people were lied to or not fully informed. Some people said they were not told they were not qualified but their money was taken anyway." Salinas also has been under investigation by the U.S. Labor Department, which sent two investigators to Orange County to assist in his arrest Thursday. Johnston said the case was made difficult because many of Salinas' customers are poorly educated, possibly in the country without proper papers and are afraid to speak to authorities for fear they will be deported. Although the tax evasion charges have nothing to do with the fraud investigation, Johnston said his office thought it was important to make the case because "we felt that there was a real concern of injury to the community and we needed to do something." Johnston said some of Salinas' firms operate under the names Hispanic Law Center, Attorney Management Services, H2A Growers Services and Southern California Immigration Center. He said Salinas attracted customers primarily by advertising extensively on Spanish-language radio. Robin Blackwell, coordinator of the Coalition for Immigrant Rights, said her office has been "receiving complaints daily about him." "There are a lot of gullible and innocent people who are hurt," said Blackwell, whose office has been assisting the district attorney's office in its investigation of Salinas.
19890313000000000	IRS AUDITS 23 TELEVISION MINISTRIES; COULD JEOPARDIZE TAX EXEMPTION OF SOME TELEVANGELISTS. The Internal Revenue Service is auditing the finances of 23 television ministries and expects the probe could jeopardize the federal tax exemption of some evangelists. "The service is continuing to devote significant examination resources to media evangelist cases," Robert I. Brauer, assistant IRS commissioner in charge of exempt organizations, said in a letter to Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. Pickle released the report today. Because of privacy laws, the report did not mention the ministries by name. Identifying them only by number, Brauer outlined key issues against the 23, most of which are suspected of not fully reporting their income, engaging in political activities, or allowing their earnings to benefit officials of the ministry. The IRS stepped up its examination of TV ministries after the well-publicized sex-and-bribery scandal at the PTL organization headed by Jim Bakker.  'Move to Final Stages' PTL, which apparently is ministry No. 15 in the report, is in bankruptcy court, where the IRS is pressing claims that Bakker and his associates failed to pay tax on unrelated business income, such as from rental of PTL's satellite network; failed to report some income, and used PTL contributions for their own enrichment, including acceptance of salaries that the IRS contends were excessive. Brauer said he expects several of the TV ministry cases "will move to the final stages of the examination process this year." "We also anticipate that some of these cases will present serious issues relating to continued federal income tax exemption," Brauer said. Brauer's cover letter said two organizations connected with former Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson have refused to provide records of the type that other TV ministries have provided voluntarily. Because the Freedom Council and the National Freedom Institute would not cooperate, the letter stated, the IRS had to go to federal court in Norfolk, Va., to seek to enforce a summons for the records. "The degree of cooperation received by the service varies from case to case and, in one case involving a prominent evangelist, the service has reached agreement on federal tax issues for the years 1980 through 1983, including payment of substantial federal income tax, interest and penalties," Brauer wrote. Here are some highlights of the report, which was current through Dec. 31: -- Ministry No. 1 was engaged in a life style that led the IRS to believe that some income was not reported. Acting on an informant's tip, the Criminal Investigation Division prepared a case that has been referred to a federal grand jury. -- No. 4: IRS agents are reviewing content of TV broadcasts to determine whether they were primarily political. -- No. 8: A team of auditors and a computer specialist are investigating allegations of political activities, lobbying and personal enrichment from ministry funds. -- No. 16: The IRS has completed review of the books and records for this ministry for 1984 through 1986. The chief issue is whether tax-deductible contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefit of the founder and his family.
19900315000000000	3 OF SHERIFF'S 4 NARCOTICS UNITS ALLEGEDLY STOLE CASH. The theft of drug money seized by narcotics officers has been a widespread practice in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for several years and has involved members of three elite narcotics squads, federal investigators alleged in affidavits unsealed Wednesday. In the most detailed disclosures yet in a broadening money-skimming scandal, the affidavits filed by FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents portray veteran sheriff's narcotics officers as stealing money from suspected drug dealers and money launderers -- and sometimes squabbling over cash taken during the raids. Relying on information from one indicted officer, other deputies and their own months-long probe, federal investigators said that members of three of the four sheriff's narcotics squads investigating major drug cases were involved or were aware that money was stolen during drug raids, the documents said. No dollar amount was given for the alleged thefts, which some officers told investigators date back to the mid-1980s. But the affidavits, which were used to justify search warrants on the officers' homes and businesses, noted that millions of dollars have been confiscated by the narcotics teams and outlined a problem more sweeping than investigators or sheriff's officials had ever publicly acknowledged. Ten officers, including all nine members of one of the sheriff's major narcotics teams, have been indicted for allegedly stealing more than $1.4 million from suspected drug traffickers and money launderers over the last two years alone. But in one case cited in the affidavits unsealed Wednesday, members of another narcotics squad reportedly bragged that they had "scored big" during a 1988 drug raid and stole several hundred thousand dollars. A week later, members of the crew took a trip to Mexico together, the affidavit said. According to the affidavit, the primary source for that information was former Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, one of the indicted officers and the head of the drug squad that was indicted two weeks ago. While the nine other officers pleaded not guilty, Sobel entered a guilty plea last week to conspiracy and filing a false income tax return and agreed to testify against his one-time colleagues. Sobel, who resigned from the Sheriff's Department this week, was prominently mentioned in the federal documents as a key source for some of the information obtained by investigators. In one affidavit, FBI Special Agent Robert H. Hightower said Sobel told him that every money-seizure case involving the three major narcotics teams "in the last few years would be highly suspect." He said that Sobel also had been told by one narcotics officer from another team that "dissension" had developed among deputies because some members were taking larger shares of the stolen money. According to the affidavit, Sobel began cooperating with the government shortly after he was suspended last September along with eight fellow officers. At one point, he even met with some of his former deputies and reported on their conversations to federal investigators. Describing the former sergeant as having received at least $125,000 in stolen drug money during the last two years, Hightower added that much of Sobel's information was corroborated by investigators. "Currency-skimming has become a practice, not a rarity, in those years," Hightower noted in his affidavit, "and has increased in the past two years as the seizures themselves have increased." Citing Sobel's statements, along with other information gathered by investigators, Hightower concluded that members of the three sheriff's teams "and their close associates share in or at least know about the fact that currency is being stolen during these narcotics raids" and that they also were engaged in laundering the money to avoid detection. Federal prosecutors would not comment on the affidavits, but Undersheriff Robert Edmonds said the alleged involvement of other major narcotics squads in the money-skimming scandal led to the department's decision to disband the teams last fall. "You have a glimpse at why we took that action," Edmonds said, adding that additional suspensions may be a possibility as the investigation continues. In addition to the 10 indicted officers, eight others have been suspended in the probe. The wife of one indicted deputy also was named in the grand jury indictment that contained 27 counts of conspiracy, theft, money laundering, filing false income tax returns and other criminal charges. The grand jury indictment also claims the officers spent hundreds of thousands of dollars stolen from drug suspects on such lavish gifts as cars, boats, jewelry, furniture and vacation homes. With the exception of Sobel, all have maintained their innocence. According to the affidavit, the investigation into the money-skimming scandal began on Oct. 28, 1988, when an anonymous letter was sent to Sheriff Sherman Block and other top officials. The letter, purportedly written by the wife of a narcotics officer, alleged that her husband and his fellow crew members were stealing drug money and living "well beyond their means." When the letter was traced to a photocopy machine in the same center that houses the narcotics officers, investigators suspected that another officer had sent the letter. The following March, a deputy whose two sisters had previously been married to deputies working on major drug teams claimed that such squad members had been stealing money and property during raids since 1985. Another deputy, who refused to give his name but said he was recruited for a narcotics team job, told a sheriff's investigator that the narcotics officers even used a profile in determining whether or not to steal money during a drug raid, one affidavit said. "These thefts generally involved raids of South American or Latin American individuals who had little or no narcotics but large amounts of currency," the affidavit said. Another retired narcotics deputy allegedly told a top sheriff's official that members of the narcotics bureau had invested money in a restaurant business that investigators contend required a net worth of at least $1 million and net assets of $600,000. When asked where such large sums were coming from, the retiree balked at answering, the affidavit said.
19890318000000000	IMMIGRATION CENTER FACING PROBE MAY HAVE DEFRAUDED THOUSANDS. Araceli Scheel has endured much in her young life. A refugee from the political turmoil of El Salvador, where she lost her husband in the civil war, and the repression and poverty of her homeland, Guatemala, she undertook a dangerous journey 9 years ago hoping for a better life here. Her dreams have come at a cost, however. The Orange County resident is one of thousands of Spanish-speaking immigrants who authorities say may have been defrauded by one of the largest immigration legalization services in the area. She says she wants her story told so that others might avoid the expense and pain she has endured. "Maybe others will be motivated to come forward with their stories," she said, speaking softly through an interpreter. "They are taking in so many people." The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the owner of Southern California Immigration Center, which Scheel approached for help in handling her amnesty application, on a variety of complaints. Oscar Salinas, 51, an El Toro businessman who owns the Immigration Center and other area immigration assistance firms, was arrested March 9 at his home and charged with 12 felony counts of tax evasion. Those charges stem from a yearlong, ongoing fraud investigation and were brought because authorities were concerned about a potential danger to the Latino community, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gerald C. Johnston said. "We proceeded with what we could for right now because of the complaints we have received and our concern for further harm in the community," he said. "These people are very vulnerable and often easily victimized." Salinas could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Lew Geiser, said Salinas has pleaded not guilty to the tax evasion charges. But he would not respond directly to the fraud investigation because no charges have been filed in the case. "Until a formal charge is levied, and we are informed of specific cases, there is nothing to respond to," he said. Johnston would not characterize the specific practices that are being investigated but said they generally involve false promises of amnesty or work permits in exchange for a fee. Johnston said authorities estimate that about 2,000 people have used Salinas' companies to get work permits for as much as $2,500 apiece. The firms may represent as many as 5,000 clients altogether, he said. Robin Blackwell, coordinator for the Santa Ana-based Coalition of Immigrant's Rights, said her group has been receiving complaints for months about Salinas' companies and that many in the Latino community are finally willing to take their stories to authorities. "Many don't even realize they are being defrauded because they are strung along by a paper process that looks legitimate," said Blackwell, who is helping the district attorney's office in the case. Blackwell said Scheel's story is typical of others' experiences since immigration reform laws took effect in 1986. Scheel, 35, contacted the Southern California Immigration Center in June, 1987, after hearing about its services on a Spanish language radio station. She had arrived in this country in 1980 from Guatemala after paying $300 to a professional "coyote" to be brought across the border, leaving her three children behind with her parents. Her Salvadoran husband had been killed the same year, before the couple could flee El Salvador. At first, Scheel lived with a brother in Costa Mesa. Then for 2 years she worked as a live-in housekeeper for an attorney. She paid $2,000 for a family acquaintance to retrieve her children from Guatemala, and they arrived in 1981. Scheel wanted to stay in the country and decided to apply for amnesty, but says she was told by an employee of the Southern California Immigration Center that she did not qualify because she had left the United States for a week in 1984. She says she was told that the company instead could obtain a work permit and a non-immigrant visa for her for $3,500. She signed a contract and paid $1,500, promising the rest in monthly payments. During the months that followed, the firm sent Scheel various cards and documents identifying her as someone who had applied for a work permit -- none of which carried the weight of law, Blackwell said. In fact, Scheel did qualify for amnesty, Blackwell said. "She was inappropriately told she did not qualify and advised to seek something much more expensive and paid money she didn't need to," Blackwell added. Scheel learned that she was eligible for amnesty when she sought a second opinion from advisers at St. Anne's Church in Santa Ana. She applied the day before amnesty expired. Still, she continued to send monthly payments to the Immigration Center. She also kept letters from them warning that whatever she read in the media about amnesty eligibility was false. Scheel said she stuck with the center when they offered to represent her at her amnesty interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But when the adviser they sent didn't even speak Spanish, she stopped her payments. "I came to believe more and more that this place was not providing legitimate help," she said. She took her case to the Orange County Human Relations Commission after reading about Salinas' arrest. She said she still receives letters from the Immigration Center demanding that she pay more than the $600 they claim she owes. "The bad part is that I referred at least 10 people to that place," she said. "I know people who are still making payments to them. I thought it was a way for people to get" legal status.
19900321000000000	2 DEPUTIES BALK IN DRUG SCANDAL, ARE SUSPENDED; INVESTIGATION: THE SHERIFF'S NARCOTICS OFFICERS REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MONEY-SKIMMING PROBE WITHOUT HAVING AN ATTORNEY PRESENT.. Two more Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics officers have been suspended after balking at questions posed by investigators probing a widening money-skimming scandal, an attorney for the two deputies and sheriff's officials said Tuesday. The officers were abruptly relieved of duty last Friday after refusing to answer questions about the alleged theft of seized drug money until their attorney could be present, said Richard Shinee, chief counsel for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. Shinee, who refused to identify the deputies, claimed the suspensions violated the rights of the deputies and were part of a "squeeze play" by sheriff's officials to try to pressure narcotics officers into cooperating with the money-skimming investigation. The scandal, which has already led to the indictment of 10 veteran officers and the suspension of eight others, has shaken the nation's largest sheriff's department and has spotlighted theft allegations against members of the elite narcotics squads that once handled major drug investigations. But Shinee said he is unaware of any evidence that the two newly suspended officers have been involved in any thefts. Instead, he said the deputies were questioned merely in an attempt to intimidate them and other officers into cooperating with investigatators. "My understanding is that these deputies were fully willing to participate in interviews, but with counsel present to ensure that their rights are protected," Shinee said. "And for simply attempting to secure that right, they were relieved of duty." Sheriff's officials also refused to identify the two deputies. "They were relieved because they chose not to talk to us as potential witnesses," said Undersheriff Robert Edmonds, who claimed the men disobeyed a direct order to answer questions. Asked if the officers were the targets of any theft allegations themselves, Edmonds said, "I don't want to characterize that any further except to say they were potential witnesses." Shinee, however, said he had listened to a tape-recording of the interview with one suspended deputy and disputed Edmonds' contention that the men were ordered to respond directly to questions. Shinee said the deputy was asked to respond voluntarily and asked for his attorney only after being told that theft allegations had been leveled against his entire crew. "Upon being advised that he was a possible suspect, he invoked his rights," Shinee said. The Times learned that the two deputies, who average nearly 20 years in the department, were among the estimated 40 officers on four teams investigating major narcotics cases. The crews were disbanded last fall after it was disclosed that some narcotics officers were accused of stealing drug money confiscated from narcotics traffickers and money launderers. A grand jury indictment alleges that the members of one major narcotics crew alone had stolen more than $1.4 million during an 18-month period. All nine members of that crew plus another deputy who worked on another major violators team were indicted last month on charges of conspiracy, theft and income tax violations. While Sgt. Robert R. Sobel pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, the remaining nine officers and the wife of one deputy -- who was also indicted -- pleaded not guilty. In an affidavit filed by the federal government and made public last week, investigators from the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service said that officers from three of the four narcotics investigation crews were involved in taking drug money and laundering the stolen cash or were aware of that activity. The fourth team was not cited in the federal affidavit. However, sources said the two deputies relieved of duty last weekend were assigned to that last crew before the teams were dismantled. The new suspensions are the first in several months and come amid more disclosures about the massive investigation that began in October, 1988, and escalated last year after the FBI and IRS joined the probe. According to the first of 57 search warrants and seizure documents unsealed this week, federal agents used a videotaped sting, wiretaps, information from drug dealers, tips from fellow deputies, financial records, interviews and the cooperation of Sobel to build their case against the suspected deputies. In a sweep last fall of homes and businesses owned by the indicted officers, sheriff's investigators and federal agents reported seizing tens of thousands of dollars in cash from private safes, bedroom drawers, briefcases and on tables. As much as $13,280 was found in one deputy's home, the search warrants said. Another $13,069 was discovered in another home and $11,706 in cash was found on a kitchen counter, in bedroom drawers and in a safe at another deputy's home, the warrants said. Some of that money, federal investigators claimed, came from stolen drug cash or was part of money that had been taken during an undercover FBI sting last August against the deputies.
19900321000000000	ADVISER PLEADS GUILTY TO THEFT AND EVADING TAXES. An adviser to some of the most prominent takeover specialists of the 1980s pleaded guilty Tuesday to stealing $1 million from clients and evading and falsifying state income taxes. Donald C. Carter, 41, chairman and founder of the Carter Organization Inc., waived indictment and pleaded guilty in state Supreme Court in Manhattan to grand larceny and filing a false and fraudulent personal income tax return. Among those Carter worked for as a proxy solicitor were T. Boone Pickens Jr., Saul P. Steinberg, Irwin A. Jacobs and Sir James Goldsmith. The firm, which had suspended Carter from his duties on Monday, announced later Tuesday that it had fired Carter. In a news release, the firm said that until Carter's statement published in Monday's Wall Street Journal that he intended to plead guilty to the charges, "Mr. Carter denied that he stole from some of the clients of the Carter Organization." "The Carter Organization, as Mr. Carter's former employer, said it is committee to cooperating with those clients to remedy any damage caused by Mr. Carter's criminality," the statement read. "The company is also committed to ensuring that this kind of conduct can never reoccur." The Carter Organization also stated it would take "appropriate action" if Carter was found to have defrauded the company. James W. Wetzler, commissioner of the state Taxation and Finance Department, called Carter's plea a "symbol of the greed that motivated so much of the '80s." Officials made the announcement at a news conference here. Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, which headed the Carter investigation, said business records seized at Carter's Manhattan office and at a Brooklyn warehouse showed a "systematic pattern of greed and fraud." He said that between 1984 and 1989 Carter routinely billed his clients for non-existent or inflated expenses and when questioned about the expenses, he supplied fraudulent documentation to justify them. The corporate clients he was said to have defrauded included Union Carbide Corp., Shell Oil, Caesars World Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc., which owns the Revlon cosmetics company. Carter had faced up to 11 years in prison, but Justice George F. Roberts promised him a prison term of 16 months to 4 years and a fine of up to $2 million when he is sentenced May 2.
19890322000000000	METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; EX-HOSPITAL CHIEF ADMITS TO KICKBACKS. The former administrator of a Monrovia hospital has pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to accepting $6,000 in kickbacks from two doctors to allow them to continue managing the hospital's emergency room. Dennis Cheshire, 46, who served as administrator of Monrovia Community Hospital in 1985 and 1986, also pleaded guilty to filing a fraudulent income tax return, Assistant U.S. Atty. Brian Hennigan said Tuesday. Cheshire, who is now the administrator of Los Angeles Doctors Hospital, could not be reached for comment. Cheshire's attorney, Ronald Nessim, said his client was approached in 1985 by the two doctors because they wanted him to ask the hospital's parent corporation, Paracelsus Health Corp., to extend their contracts and increase their pay. Nessim said Cheshire spent the money on parties to improve employee morale.
19890322000000000	BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE EVEN MORE; REPORTS SAY HE GAMBLED ON BASEBALL, TREATED FAMILY BADLY. Pete Rose, being investigated by the baseball commissioner's office for possible gambling activities, is also under close scrutiny from two of the nation's magazines. The specifics of major league baseball's investigation of the Cincinnati Reds' manager is for possible betting on baseball games, Sports Illustrated reported in this week's issue. Jim Ferguson, the Reds' vice president for publicity, said he spoke with Rose Tuesday night about the Sports Illustrated allegations. "He's just continuing, as he has all along, not to have anything to say," Ferguson said. And Rose was not only a gambler, but a poor father and husband who rarely showed affection, flaunted his affairs and rarely saw his first two children, according to the April issue of Gentlemen's Quarterly. Baseball officials announced Monday that Rose was under investigation for unspecified gambling activity. Rose has previously admitted to parimutuel betting on horses and dogs, a legal endeavor, but has denied betting on baseball and college basketball games. Rose could be suspended for a year, according to baseball rules, if he bet on games not involving his team. If Rose bet on games involving the Reds, he could be banned for life. Sports Illustrated said that Ron Peters, the owner of a restaurant in Franklin, Ohio, has been linked to possible baseball betting involving Rose. It said that Alan Statman, Peters' lawyer, described his client as Rose's "principal bookmaker" and approached the magazine last week in hopes of selling Peters' story. The magazine said it declined. The Dayton Daily News, in a copyright story, said Rose is under investigation by federal agents looking into gambling allegations. The newspaper did not identify its source but said the investigation stemmed from an unrelated investigation of Peters, whom, the paper said, filed for bankruptcy Jan. 19. Sports Illustrated also said that Statman told two of its reporters that he and his client had been asked by Kevin Hallinan, baseball's security chief, "if we had information on Pete Rose betting on baseball. We said we can supply that information." The magazine added that Paul Janszen, whom it described as a body builder friend of Rose, is "another man said by sources to have been involved with Rose in baseball betting." Janszen also recently discussed selling a story about Rose to Sports Illustrated, the magazine said. Janszen is serving a six-month sentence in a Cincinnati halfway house after pleading guilty in January to a charge of evading taxes on income from the sale of steroids. Sports Illustrated said that another weightlifter, who was not identified, told the magazine that he had placed bets on baseball games that he understood to be from Rose, using a telephone at a gym in suburban Cincinnati. "Janszen used to come into the gym, pull out the newspaper and go over all the baseball games," the magazine quoted the unidentified weightlifter as saying. "He'd mark them with a pen, then he'd go into the office and phone in bets for Pete Rose. He never said he was doing it for Pete. But that's what the talk was around the gym." Sports Illustrated said that Michael Fry, a former co-owner of the gym, who is serving eight years in federal prison for cocaine trafficking and income-tax evasion, told its reporter that Rose never bet on baseball games but often talked about which baseball teams would be good to bet on. Fry also said, according to the magazine, that he had heard that Tommy Gioisa, also a friend of Rose's, placed bets with bookies on college and pro basketball and football games and that Fry said he understood that those bets were for Rose. Gioisa told the magazine that he was a professional gambler, but said he had never placed a bet for Rose. In the story in Gentleman's Quarterly, it was reported that Rose was rumored to have lost $13,000 in one day at a race track. Karolyn Rose is quoted as saying that her former husband once refused to acknowledge a gambling debt and later received a dead fish in the mail. "He said he was Pete Rose, and he didn't have to pay no gambling debts," Karolyn Rose said in the article. However, Karolyn Rose told the Associated Press that she had been misquoted and didn't know anything about a dead fish being delivered to her former husband. She also said that Rose has never bet on baseball. In the article, written by Pat Jordan, Rose's daughter, Fawn, calls him "the world's worst father." "I will never understand why he never had any time for us," Fawn Rose said. "We didn't expect anything from him, except to just like us. All we ever did was love him and want him to love us back." Rose's son, Pete Jr., also described his father, who has remarried and had another son since divorcing his first wife, as distant. "We're not alike," said Rose Jr., a third baseman in the Baltimore Orioles' minor league system. "I never hugged or kissed my dad. If I did, he'd think I was a sissy. My relationship with him is more player-manager. Sometimes he gives me a high five." Karolyn Rose said she filed for divorce in 1979 because Rose "was flaunting his women and I had to protect the kids, not because I didn't love him anymore." In fact, she said she hasn't dated since the divorce and still sets an extra plate at the dinner table every Jan. 25 on their wedding anniversary. "I still believe he'll come home someday," she was quoted as saying. "Is that stupid?" Rose would not talk about either the commissioner's investigation or the magazine stories and there was extra security in Al Lang Stadium at St. Petersburg, Fla., where the Reds are in spring training. Rose arrived about an hour before an exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals, walked briskly through two dozen reporters and photographers, and remained in his office, where an armed, uniformed guard stood watch. Rose gave his usual pregame radio interview to broadcaster Marty Brennaman, but shed no light on the investigation. "Well, Marty, all I can tell you is we are cooperating with the commissioner's office, and we hope that it gets taken care of real fast, before opening day, so we can get down to business," Rose said. "And business is winning the National League West. That's all I'd like to say about that." While reporters waited for Rose, players worked out on the field, sneaking looks at the throng. They had to pick their way through the crowd to get to the bat rack.
19890323000000000	FIRST CONVICTION IN DREXEL PROBE: AIDE AT BEVERLY HILLS OFFICE IS GUILTY OF PERJURY. The federal investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert claimed its first guilty verdict Wednesday when a jury convicted a 26-year-old trading assistant from the firm's Beverly Hills office of perjury and obstruction of justice. A jury deliberated for only four hours before concluding that Lisa Jones of Sherman Oaks had lied repeatedly in January, 1988, during testimony to a grand jury investigating Drexel, the head of its "junk bond" department, Michael Milken, and a small securities firm, Princeton/Newport Partners. She was convicted on five counts of perjury and two of obstruction of justice. But the jury acquitted her on one obstruction count. Jones, who had cried during her testimony and had again been in tears during the brief deliberations, was comforted after the verdict by two women friends who had accompanied her from Los Angeles. She was then led silently from the courtroom by her lawyer. Jones faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.7 million. Under new federal sentencing guidelines, she will almost certainly have to spend time in prison, although prosecutors said they hadn't yet calculated the minimum possible sentence. But if she had been convicted on only one count she would have been required to serve from 10 to 16 months in prison. The conviction raises the possibility that Jones could receive a longer sentence than was imposed on either Dennis B. Levine or Ivan F. Boesky, the two Wall Street figures whose guilty pleas and cooperation with the government led to the Drexel investigation and a chain of other Wall Street cases. Levine was sentenced to two years in prison and Boesky to three years.  Rejected Plea Bargain U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand set sentencing for May 22. He allowed Jones to remain free on bail. Brian O'Neill, Jones' defense attorney, throughout the trial had portrayed her as a "scapegoat" and "victim" in the government's quest to prosecute higher-ups at Drexel and Princeton/Newport. He said after the verdict that she "got stuck paying the price for whatever occurred." He called the outcome "tragic" and said Jones was "a little person run down by a truck." O'Neill said he plans to appeal. But Bruce Baird, head of the securities fraud unit in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, said: "We think justice was done." He added: "We think that whenever people lie to the grand jury, we're not doing our job if we don't prosecute them." Mark Hansen, the prosecutor who tried the case, rejected criticism by Jones' supporters that the government had been unduly harsh in bringing the charges and vigorously prosecuting her. He said that during the grand jury proceedings she had repeatedly rejected chances offered to her by prosecutors to change her testimony and tell the truth. "She is nobody other than a foolish young woman who made a dumb choice despite numerous opportunities to make the right choice," he said. Jones had been called to New York in January, 1988, to testify before a grand jury looking into charges that Princeton/Newport Partners had illegally "parked" bonds with Drexel in a complicated scheme meant to help Princeton/Newport evade taxes. Under the scheme, the trades between Princeton/Newport and Drexel allegedly were rigged so that Princeton/Newport would get the securities back at a fixed price.  Presented as Scared, Confused Jones denied to the grand jury that that she was aware of any illegal parking. But during the trial, prosecutors presented tape recordings of telephone conversations between Drexel and Princeton/Newport, including one tape in which Jones was heard discussing the trades with William Hale, a Princeton/Newport trader. Hale testified against Jones during the trial. He presented Jones as a scared and confused minor employee at Drexel who had been intimidated by government investigators and wasn't aware that she was involved in any illegal activity. Testimony in the trial disclosed that Jones had run away from her New Jersey home at the age of 13 and obtained a job as a bank teller in Los Angeles by lying about her age. She eventually was offered a job at Drexel and worked her way up to being a trading assistant in the junk bond department, working in the same trading room as Milken. In 1988, she earned $117,000 in salary plus a $45,000 bonus, helping Drexel traders execute their transactions. At the time of her grand jury testimony, Jones had been represented by the law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, which was Drexel's main outside law firm. Five Princeton/Newport partners have since been named in a separate indictment that includes racketeering and securities fraud charges. They deny any wrongdoing and are awaiting trial.  Drexel Backs Jones More recently, Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to six criminal counts, including one involving Princeton/Newport. But the firm hasn't formally entered its plea yet pending settlement of separate civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Milken, who as head of Drexel's junk bond department in Beverly Hills was behind much of the firm's success and also much of its legal problems, has been notified by prosecutors that he too is likely to be indicted soon. But he denies breaking any laws. While the deliberations were under way, Richard Sandler, a longtime friend of Milken's who is one of his main attorneys, stopped in the courtroom to offer sympathy and encouragement to Jones. He said he was present because "she is a person that I care about." Drexel, too, has been supportive of Jones throughout the case, continuing to pay her salary even though she is on leave and picking up much of her travel and legal expenses. In a statement after the verdict, Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman, said: "Lisa Jones was fondly regarded as a warm and highly industrious individual" by the people she worked with. He said: "The verdict today, therefore, is a very sad event which causes us a great deal of sorrow." Anreder said that Jones was still officially on leave and that he didn't know if her employment status would change as a result of the verdict.
19900331000000000	FRAUD INQUIRY TARGET WINS A ROUND IN COURT; INSURANCE: THE GOVERNMENT AGREES NOT TO FORCE THE SEIZURE OF $2.8 MILLION FROM AN ATTORNEY SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE ALLIANCE CASE.. Attorney Lynn B. Stites, the focus of a criminal investigation in the "Alliance" insurance fraud case, has won a skirmish in his battle with the federal government, which bungled an attempt to seize $2.8 million it says Stites owes in unpaid taxes, according to papers filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In a notice filed Friday, government lawyers conceded defeat, saying they would not defend an extraordinary move by the Internal Revenue Service to seize bank accounts, real estate and other assets belonging to Stites and his former wife, Erma Stites. The IRS action -- known as a jeopardy assessment, and most often used to tax cash seized in drug raids -- was taken last November. Attorneys for the Stiteses moved to void it on legal grounds. A hearing scheduled for Friday on the dispute was called off when the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said the government "agrees that the . . . jeopardy assessment should be abated." Stites could not be reached for comment and his attorneys would not discuss his whereabouts. But one of them, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., called the decision an "emotional lift" for the embattled Stites, who has been described in nationwide media coverage as the alleged mastermind of an insurance scam involving a ring of Los Angeles-area lawyers that prosecutors have called the "Alliance." Lawyers in the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles could not be reached, and an IRS spokeswoman declined comment on the case. An IRS official admitted that the agency has obtained little of value from the Stiteses. "Let's just say it was insignificant," he said. Court papers and other records show the government botched the effort to tie up Stites' assets, allowing him to withdraw at least $2 million of a legal settlement from a bank, and to sell his former home in Bell Canyon in eastern Ventura County for more than $500,000. In October, Stites settled bitter litigation with former client Leonard M. Ross for a total of $3.8 million. Stites got $2.3 million of the insurance-funded settlement, and Ross $1.5 million. In late October, Stites withdrew at least $2 million of the money from a bank in Beverly Hills, including more than $1 million in $100 bills that was stuffed in a flight bag, according to a knowledgeable source who would not speak if identified. The IRS then tried to seize Stites' share of the settlement, but showed up nearly a month too late. In a sworn declaration filed in court this week, Stites attorney Mesereau said IRS official Sharon Lavenberg served a notice of the levy at his Century City law office on Nov. 15. Mesereau said Lavenberg told him an informant monitoring the Ross-Stites case was to tip off authorities when the settlement was imminent, but that the plan got "screwed up." Authorities "were very distressed that they had not received immediate word of the settlement," Mesereau said Lavenberg told him. Lavenberg could not be reached for comment. The Stiteses sold their Bell Canyon home for about $544,000 on Nov. 22, seven days after the jeopardy assessment, according to records at the Ventura County clerk and recorder's office. Records show that the IRS prepared a notice of lien on the home on Nov. 16, but did not record the lien until Nov. 28. The IRS can make a jeopardy assessment if it decides it is in jeopardy of losing taxes owed because assets may be hidden or dissipated. The Stiteses' lawyers attacked the assessment as illegal and as an attempt to deprive Stites of funds for an effective defense against criminal charges that may be filed against him and as many as 15 to 20 others in the Alliance case. George D. Hardy, the assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego heading up the Alliance investigation, said depriving Stites of money to defend himself was "absolutely not a strategy" in the jeopardy assessment. Despite voiding the jeopardy assessment, the IRS still can take Stites to court over the $2.8 million it claims he owes in unpaid taxes for 1987. According to court papers, the claim is based on allegations that another lawyer in the insurance fraud ring paid Stites $5 million in 1987 that he did not declare as income. This was dismissed as a "foolish . . . theory" by lawyers for Stites. Stites and other alleged Alliance lawyers took part in cases in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties in which insurance companies paid legal fees for numerous defendants. The ring is accused by insurance companies and federal authorities of conspiring to prolong and expand the cases to increase each attorney's workload and subsequent billings to insurers. Four lawyers, two law firm employees and one client have pleaded guilty to mail fraud in the case, and two other attorneys have been indicted on charges of lying to the federal grand jury investigating the case. About 15 to 20 other lawyers, law firm employees and associates recently received letters from the U.S. attorney in San Diego, informing them that they may be indicted on racketeering charges. Times staff writer Carlos Lozano contributed to this story.
19890404000000000	NEWSWIRE: NAMES IN THE NEWS. Ronald Peters, identified as a key figure in the investigation that led to a gambling probe of Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose, announced his intent to plead guilty to federal drug and tax charges.
19890404000000000	PROSECUTOR SUSPENDED; LED PROBE OF ALLEGED MAFIOSO. A federal prosecutor who headed a controversial investigation into a reputed organized crime figure's business ties to MCA Inc. has been suspended from his job and barred from his office at the Los Angeles organized crime strike force, The Times has learned. Marvin Rudnick, who had been at odds with his Justice Department superiors since 1987 over the Salvatore Pisello-MCA investigation, was notified last Thursday that he has been placed on paid leave pending a decision on whether to fire him, according to knowledgeable sources. Rudnick was called into the office of strike force chief John L. Newcomer, ordered to hand over his keys to the office and then escorted out of the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, sources said. Justice Department officials refused to confirm the report, calling it a "personnel matter," and Rudnick's lawyer said he was warned by department officials in Washington not to make any statement. "We've been, I guess you could say, warned by the Justice Department in Washington not to make any statement about this, and we intend to abide by that," said the attorney, Michael L. Kadish. Rudnick, 41, has been the subject of an internal Justice Department inquiry stemming from his handling of a strike force investigation into Pisello's business dealings with MCA Records from 1983 to 1985. In September, 1987, MCA lawyers met with top officials of the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles and later hired an influential Washington attorney to contact the top leadership of the Justice Department's organized crime and racketeering section about Rudnick's handling of the investigation, which they characterized as irresponsible. After complaints from MCA that the prosecutor was maligning the company with unsupported organized crime allegations, Rudnick's superiors reportedly ordered him to limit the investigation to allegations that Pisello had evaded taxes on his income from MCA.  Convicted of Tax Evasion Pisello, who has been identified by the FBI as a member of New York's Gambino crime family, was convicted last year of evading taxes on more than $300,000 in income earned in a series of transactions with MCA's records division. Rudnick tried the case under Newcomer's close supervision. None of the MCA executives who dealt with Pisello were charged with any wrongdoing. All said they had been unaware of Pisello's alleged Mafia ties, which he himself has vehemently denied. According to a variety of federal sources, the Justice Department's office of professional responsibility opened an investigation to determine, among other things, whether Rudnick had violated federal grand jury secrecy laws by publicly revealing that top MCA executives had notified him of their intention to exercise their 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination if called to testify about the Pisello case. The office's findings have not been made public, but sources close to the probe have said the report supported Rudnick on the grand jury secrecy issue. The report did, however, conclude that Rudnick has been insubordinate with his superiors. On Thursday, sources said, Newcomer handed Rudnick a one-page letter signed by Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., acting assistant attorney general for the department's criminal division. Attached to the letter was a memorandum to Dennis from David Margolis, chief of the Justice Department's organized crime unit, which stated, in effect, that Rudnick had not been following orders from Newcomer. "This is to notify you that you are being placed in a temporary non-duty status with pay effective immediately upon your receipt of this letter for the period of time necessary to consider and resolve the accompanying proposal to remove you from federal service," said the letter, the contents of which were read to The Times. Rudnick may be entitled to an internal hearing, some sources said, and is expected to seek help from current and former Justice Department attorneys, some of whom have told The Times they believe he is being "railroaded."  'Barbaric and Unconscionable' John DuBois, a former strike force attorney who worked with Rudnick on the Pisello case, said he does not believe Rudnick did anything wrong. "Their action is barbaric and unconscionable," he said of the decision to suspend Rudnick. Rudnick has prosecuted a number of high-profile white-collar crime cases during his 13-year government career. He has been a special attorney with the Los Angeles strike force for the last nine years. Rudnick is married to Times staff writer Kathryn Harris. This story was reported by William K. Knoedelseder Jr., Kim Murphy and Ronald L. Soble.
19900406000000000	HELMSLEY ASKS THE STATE TO DROP TAX EVASION CHARGES. A lawyer for Leona Helmsley urged a judge Thursday to dismiss state tax evasion charges against the self-styled hotel queen and prove that there is not "one law for the wealthy . . . and another for everyone else." Dabbing her eyes and nose with a tissue, Helmsley sobbed softly as her attorney, Sandor Frankel, said his client had been "ground up in the justice machine for nearly five years." Helmsley, 70, was convicted of federal tax fraud and sentenced last fall to a four-year prison term. The sentence has been stayed pending her appeal. Helmsley now faces prosecution for allegedly cheating on her state taxes. She is accused of disguising millions of dollars in renovations at her Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business expenses incurred by the hotel empire that she and her husband Harry run. Outside state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Helmsley told reporters she was being unfairly pursued by prosecutors because of her celebrity status. She said she would fight the charges and prove her innocence. "Enough's enough," said Helmsley. She burst into tears again and her team of eight lawyers and a handful of bodyguards rushed her toward her gray limousine. "I am not going to jail. I've done nothing wrong. My only crime is that I'm Leona Helmsley. For that I'm guilty," Helmsley said. Harry Helmsley, 81, who was ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial in the federal case, is expected to undergo a competency examination in April in the state case. A hearing was slated for April 30. On Thursday, Frankel urged Justice John Bradley to dismiss charges against Helmsley, saying they were improper because they grew out of immunized testimony she gave to a 1985 grand jury investigating sales tax evasion. He also said the state charges were based on the same allegations as the federal charges and therefore represent double jeopardy. He said Helmsley's conviction on federal tax charges, combined with her state charges on tax evasion, gives the impression "there is one law for the wealthy, well-known and vilified and another for everyone else." Frankel said the public has already gotten a clear message that tax evasion is wrong from the ordeal of Helmsley's federal trial and her stiff prison sentence. "I think the public on the outside looking in would say, 'It's not worth it. The destruction of human life -- what for?' " Frankel said. But Assistant Atty. Gen. Alfredo Mendez said it would be in the interest of justice to prosecute Helmsley to the fullest extent of the law. "We're talking about at least $1 million dollars. I just think about the number of police officers, teachers and school lunches that New Yorkers go without when people don't pay their taxes," said Mendez. The judge said he would rule on the dismissal motions May 17.
19890408000000000	NEWSWIRE. Thomas P. Gioiosa, who once lived with Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose and his family, was released in Boston on $20,000 bond, after being indicted on charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. A five-count indictment, returned in Cincinnati, accused Gioiosa of income tax evasion for 1985 and 1986. It also charged that he had conspired with others to arrange cocaine deliveries from Florida to Cincinnati between January 1985 and January 1987. Gioiosa, 31, refused to answer when he was asked if the charges against him were an attempt by federal authorities to get at Rose, whose gambling activities are under investigation by the baseball commissioner's office. Rose, commenting on allegations that he was a heavy gambler, said: "I'm glad I don't lose as much as people say I lose, and I wish I won as much as people think I win. I keep hearing this bull about how I'm a chronic gambler or something. "What does a chronic gambler do? He's got to find a place to gamble. Well, I got to spring training on Feb. 1, and I went to the dog track three times in 60 days. The dogs are really your only means of gambling in spring training. So I guess that's the end of that theory." Regarding his association with Gioiosa, Rose said he hadn't seen him in some time. "I don't know where Tommy Gioiosa is. Tommy Gioiosa used to live with me when he was about 18 years old. I don't have any idea what he does now," Rose said. "Any time that someone that you know is indicted for anything . . . you're surprised. And I guess I'm the same. Tommy was always a nice kid to me. And I know his mom and dad real well." Gioiosa was a member of the Massasoit Community College baseball team when he met Rose in 1978 in Tampa, Fla. He has said he lived at Rose's home in suburban Cincinnati for five years until Rose and his first wife, Karolyn, were divorced.
19890409000000000	STATE BOARD, NOT COURT, TO DECIDE WHAT IS OWED; EX-MASSAGE PARLOR OWNER REBUFFED ON TAXES. A Superior Court judge has ruled that it is up to the state Franchise Tax Board to determine how much money former college professor and massage parlor owner Hal Mintz owes in unpaid taxes stemming from his no contest plea to two counts of state income tax evasion. Judge David Perez, who last December sentenced Mintz to four years probation after Mintz pleaded no contest to the tax charges and to conspiracy to maintain a house of prostitution, had been expected to decide the matter. But last Wednesday the judge tossed the decision back to the Franchise Tax Board after an attorney for the state argued that the court had no authority to rule on the matter. The state claims that Mintz owes more than $80,000 for 1985 and 1986. Mintz claims that the amount is less than $12,000.  Long Appeals Process Anthony Glassman, a lawyer for Mintz, asked that the judge set the amount, saying that to go through a long appeals process with the Franchise Tax Board would present a "financial burden" that his client is unable to bear. Mintz resigned from his $45,000-a-year post at East Los Angeles College last August after widespread publicity about his massage parlor in West Hollywood. He had taught at the college for 19 years and was chairman of its business department at the time of his resignation. Mintz has since gone to work as an assistant office manager for a commercial real estate and development company. His massage parlor, at 8574 Santa Monica Blvd., across from City Hall in West Hollywood, was closed in February, 1988, after authorities said it was being used as a house of prostitution. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, at least 10 women had been arrested for sex-related offenses there since 1984.  Failure to File The tax evasion charges stemmed from Mintz's failure to file a return with the Franchise Tax Board for 1985 and 1986. Prosecutors said that records seized at Mintz's home in San Marino showed that the he earned at least $200,000 each of those years. As part of a plea bargain arrangement, prosecutors agreed not to charge the former professor with pimping and pandering, which carry mandatory state prison sentences. In imposing four years of probation, the judge ordered that one year be spent under house arrest, and that Mintz pay $10,000 in fines and all taxes owed the state. In addition, Mintz has assumed all costs of his house arrest, which authorities say amounts to about $10 a day.  Electronic Transmitter He was fitted with an electronic transmitter that allows law enforcement officials to ensure that he does not leave his home except for work, religious services or medical emergencies. The beeper-like device, which Mintz wears strapped above his ankle, is about the size of a chalk board eraser, and sends signals every 72 seconds through a transmitter connected through his telephone to a surveillance office in Torrance. On Wednesday, Glassman argued that the plea bargain arrangement with prosecutors stipulated that a judge would determine the amount of taxes Mintz owes. However, the judge agreed with Deputy Atty. Gen. Herbert Levin, who argued that the courts have jurisdiction over such matters only after the appeals process provided by the Franchise Tax Board has been exhausted.
19890414000000000	RING SMUGGLED TONS OF ASIAN POT, U.S. ALLEGES. Several Orange County residents, including a Tustin attorney, are among 12 people indicted in the alleged smuggling of at least 26 tons of marijuana to the West Coast from Southeast Asia, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner announced Thursday. Federal agents said the ring transported the drug in several shiploads between 1984 and 1987, usually transferring their illicit cargo to smaller vessels before landing in San Francisco. The 30-count indictment, which also alleges several conspiracies to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and violate federal tax laws, was unsealed late Wednesday after the arrests of five of the defendants. A sixth, Tustin attorney Neil C. Pearson, 50, surrendered to federal authorities Thursday morning. All were arraigned Thursday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos in Los Angeles. At the request of Assistant U.S. Attys. Steven D. Clymer and Russell Hayman, Tassopulos set bail for Pearson at $1 million. Pearson's attorney, James Riddet, called the amount an "absolute outrage" and said his client had made himself available to federal prosecutors almost from the beginning of the 18-month investigation. According to the indictment, former Maui resident William Uhler, 39, who in 1986 reportedly gave a Cypress address, and Eugene LaForce, 53, of Cave Junction, Ore., organized and directed at least four major marijuana shipments. Uhler, LaForce, longtime Maui resident Walter M. Hillinger, 56, and others allegedly brought eight tons from Thailand aboard a ship named the Lloyd B. George in September, 1984, transferring it off the coast of Mendocino County to two smaller vessels that carried it to San Francisco. Another seven tons of marijuana allegedly was brought to California in 1985 aboard the Lady Fame, an 80-foot oil supply vessel whose ownership reportedly was traced to a partnership that included several names from the obituary columns of the Orange County Register. Federal authorities said the ring went to great lengths to cover up ownership of the vessels. In 1987, the prosecutors said, Uhler, LaForce and the others smuggled 11 more tons of marijuana from Thailand to a point between Hawaii and Tahiti, where it was put aboard another vessel, the Natalie Rose, and carried to the West Coast. In addition to the drug charges, Uhler, Pearson, Dovie M. Briggs, 56, a Cypress income tax preparer who is Uhler's mother-in-law, and Terry P. Dee, 47, of Seal Beach, former owner of Faber Laboratories, a Fullerton business that tested crankcase oil, were indicted on federal income tax charges. Others indicted were Larry A. Doyle, 49, of Newport Beach; Charles E. Larsen, 45, of Costa Mesa; Martin E. Levine, 49, of New York City and San Francisco; Michael A. Tzouanakis, 35, of Costa Mesa; Walter M. Ulrich, 39, of Sunset Beach, and Dennis Tobin, 33, of Morro Bay. Times staff writer George Smith contributed to this article.
19890414000000000	INDICTMENT CITES 13 AS SMUGGLERS OF 26 TONS OF POT. Nine Orange County residents, including a Tustin attorney, are among 13 people indicted in the alleged smuggling of at least 26 tons of marijuana to the West Coast from Southeast Asia, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner announced Thursday. Federal agents said the ring transported the drug in several shiploads between 1984 and 1987, usually transferring their illicit cargo to smaller vessels before landing in San Francisco. The 30-count indictment, which also alleges several conspiracies to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and violate federal tax laws, was unsealed late Wednesday after the arrests of five of the defendants. A sixth, Tustin attorney Neil C. Pearson, 50, surrendered to federal authorities Thursday morning. All were arraigned Thursday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos in Los Angeles. At the request of Assistant U.S. Attys. Steven D. Clymer and Russell Hayman, Tassopulos set bail for Pearson at $1 million. Pearson's attorney, James Riddet, called the amount an "absolute outrage" and said his client had made himself available to federal prosecutors almost from the beginning of the 18-month investigation. Pearson could not raise the $1-million bail, Riddet said, and was being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. According to the indictment, former Maui resident William Uhler, 39, now a resident of the Orange County, community of Sunset Beach, and Eugene LaForce, 53, of Cave Junction, Ore., organized and directed at least four major marijuana shipments. Uhler, LaForce, longtime Maui resident Walter M. Hillinger, 56, and others allegedly brought eight tons from Thailand aboard a ship named the Lloyd B. George in September of 1984, transferring it off the coast of Mendocino County to two smaller vessels that carried it to San Francisco.  Arrested in Hawaii Hillinger was arrested Thursday morning in Hawaii, the U.S. attorney's office said. Another seven tons of marijuana allegedly was brought to California in 1985 aboard the Lady Fame, an 80-foot oil supply vessel whose ownership reportedly was traced to a partnership that included several names from the obituary columns of the Orange County Register. Federal authorities said the ring went to great lengths to cover up ownership of the vessels. In 1987, the prosecutors said, Uhler, LaForce and the others smuggled 11 more tons of marijuana from Thailand to a point between Hawaii and Tahiti, where it was put aboard another vessel, the Natalie Rose, and carried to the West Coast. In addition to the drug charges, Uhler, Pearson, Cypress income tax preparer Dovie M. Briggs, 56, who is Uhler's mother-in-law, and Terry P. Dee, 47, of Seal Beach, former owner of Faber Laboratories, a Fullerton business that tested crankcase oil, were indicted on federal income tax charges. Uher and Dee are accused of knowingly signing false returns for 1984 through 1987. Dee allegedly arranged to have Faber send regular payments to Uhler so that he would appear to have a legitimate income. Uhler then repaid Dee and his wife, Jeanne, 34, in cash, according to the indictment.  Millions in Drug Money The indictment also charges Pearson, Dee and Briggs with conspiring with Uhler to help him conceal millions of dollars of drug income. Pearson is alleged to have held title to a Maui house that Uhler purchased in 1984 for $375,000. The federal government seized proceeds from the house when it was sold in June of 1988. Briggs' husband, Clyde, said he had not seen his wife for two days and learned from a friend that she had been arrested. "She's innocent as hell," he insisted. "She hasn't even smoked a Camel cigarette in her life." Others indicted were Larry A. Doyle, 49, of Newport Beach; Charles E. Larsen, 45, of Costa Mesa; Martin E. Levine, 49, of New York City and San Francisco; Michael A. Tzouanakis, 35, of Costa Mesa; Walter M. Ulrich, 39, of Sunset Beach, and Dennis Tobin, 33, of Morro Bay.  Ferried Cash Federal prosecutors said Levine helped organize the smuggling trips and that Doyle oversaw loading of one of the ships. Tzouanakis purportedly ferried cash to Southeast Asia to pay expenses. Larsen was accused of skippering two of the vessels and Tobin reportedly was a crew member. Ulrich is already serving a 15-year sentence in Thailand for marijuana smuggling, Clymer said. The five others still are being sought. Uhler, LaForce, Pearson and Ulrich face possible life in prison if convicted, prosecutors said. On Thursday afternoon, Tassopulos ordered Tzouanakis held without bail. She set bail for Terry Dee at $750,000, for his wife at $50,000 and for Briggs at $100,000. Uhler was to remain in jail overnight and have a bail hearing today.

19890417000000000	IN BRIEF; GIOIOSA DENIES COCAINE CHARGES. Thomas Gioiosa, who once lived with Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose and his family, pleaded innocent today to federal charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. U.S. Magistrate Robert Steinberg allowed Gioiosa, 31, to remain free on bond. If convicted, Gioiosa could face maximum penalties of 38 years in prison and $2 million in fines. The five-count federal indictment accuses Gioiosa of income-tax evasion for the years 1985 and '86, and charges that he conspired to arrange cocaine deliveries from Florida to Cincinnati between January, 1985, and January, 1987.
19900417000000000	ISGRO CLAIMS HE'S 'FALL GUY' IN MCA PROBE; ENTERTAINMENT: THE RECORD PROMOTER HAS BEEN INDICTED ON A BEVY OF CHARGES, INCLUDING RACKETEERING.. The defense lawyer for a Glendale man accused of record industry racketeering asserted Monday that his client was "the fall guy" for a government investigation of MCA Records that had gone awry. Donald M. Re, the lawyer for Joseph Isgro, made the charge in a hearing on his motion that an indictment against Isgro, 42, be dismissed on the grounds of government misconduct. The government has denied that it engaged in any misconduct or that there was anything improper about the case against Isgro. In a court filing, two Justice Department officials assert that Isgro's motion "seems to have been gleaned from newspaper clippings" about the MCA probe and that, in any case, that controversy is irrelevant to the charges against Isgro. U.S. District Court Judge James M. Ideman said he would hold a full hearing on the motion on May 21. Isgro, once one of the nation's leading independent record promoters, was indicted by a federal grand jury last Nov. 30 on a bevy of criminal counts, including racketeering, conspiracy to defraud Columbia Records, making undisclosed "payola" payments to radio stations, mail fraud, filing false tax returns, conspiracy to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service. He has pleaded not guilty and is free on bail. If convicted of all the charges, he faces 200 years in prison and $1.4 million in fines. Re has alleged in court documents that the government's investigation of Isgro stemmed from a squelched investigation of MCA's relationship to alleged mobster Sal Pisello, who was convicted of tax evasion. Re asserted Tuesday that the government ended the MCA probe for "political reasons" and decided that it had to indict Isgro to justify the wide-reaching investigation. He asserted that several ranking Justice Department officials, including Robert Brosio, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told Marvin Rudnick, an attorney with the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force here, to halt his investigation of MCA. Instead, Rudnick was urged to investigate Isgro, according to Re's brief, which also alleges that Los Angeles Police Department officials supplied information to Rudnick about Isgro. The brief further alleges that some of the LAPD personnel in question had close ties to MCA. Eventually, Rudnick successfully prosecuted Pisello. However, he was removed from further responsibilities on the case and eventually was fired by the Justice Department. He currently is in private practice in Pasadena. Much of what Re is alleging has been reported in accounts in various newspapers and on the CBS program "60 Minutes." Re has subpoenaed both Rudnick and another former strike force lawyer, Richard Stavin, to testify about the government's handling of the case. Both were in court Monday and both said they would be back on May 21. In the past, both have been highly critical of the Justice Department's handling of the record industry probe. Rudnick did not offer any opinions on Isgro's guilt or innocence Monday. Officials of the Justice Department have denied in the past that an investigation of MCA was prematurely suppressed. They have refused to discuss Rudnick's firing, saying it was a personnel matter. On Monday, Justice Department lawyer William Lynch and Assistant U.S. Atty. Drew Pitt of the Strike Force declined any comment, as did Brosio. However, Lynch and Pitt have issued a sharp reply to Re's allegations in legal papers they filed recently. They assert that Isgro's motion "seems to have been gleaned from newspaper clippings which featured a disgruntled former Justice Department employee who was discharged," a clear reference to Rudnick. "The only impropriety suggested . . . is that a former prosecutor was prevented from pursuing an investigation of a corporate entity other than Mr. Isgro," the government's reply brief continues. "The government denies that such was the case but, even assuming this was true, it furnishes the defendant, Isgro, with no defense on his charges." An MCA spokesperson declined comment, saying, "We are not a party to this litigation."
19890423000000000	THE SILBERMAN SAGA RIVALS A TV THRILLER; ONCE STERLING IMAGE AS A SAN DIEGO MOVER AND SHAKER TARNISHED BY STRING OF CHARGES. Recounting one of "the great events of my life," Richard T. Silberman described the night that he and California Gov. Jerry Brown dined at Buckingham Palace: "We're just about to get out of this place and Prince Charles put his hand on my shoulder and says, 'Wouldn't it be bloody nice if he was President and I was king?' " Silberman, speaking at a 1987 college program about successful entrepreneurs, went on, "I think of all the things I've ever heard, this sort of just shook you up. There's no question in my mind who was going to be king." Until two weeks ago, there was no question in anybody's mind that Silberman was a man who hobnobbed at the level of presidents and kings. But then the man who had dined at Buckingham Palace was arrested by the FBI on charges that he had hatched a plan to launder drug money in meetings with a reputed mobster at a downtown Denny's. The circumstances that have kept his name in headlines shocked everyone who knew him or had heard of him. The son of an immigrant rag dealer, Silberman had parlayed the millions of dollars he made in the hamburger business and his success at political fund raising into a calling card that provided entree to elite social and political circles in San Diego, California and, at times, the world. Driven more by the thrill of high-powered deal-making than by ideology, Silberman rode his financial acumen and boundless energy to the rarefied air of multimillion-dollar business pacts and presidential politics. Though he displayed a chameleon-like tendency in his politics and occasionally trimmed ethical edges in business dealings, most simply saw those traits as evidence that Silberman, as one friend put it, "knows how to play big-league hardball." As a fast-food magnate, bank owner and state budget director under Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., Silberman, who turned 60 Saturday, gained a reputation as someone who could "make it happen." "To me, he seemed like a smaller-scale Donald Trump," one politically active lawyer said. "He was one of these guys who could get it done, whatever it was."  Boasted of Deals Completed But, on the afternoon of April 7 in a San Diego hotel room, the FBI arrested Silberman, allegedly as he was negotiating to launder $1.1 million in what he was told was Colombian cocaine money. By that point, Silberman already had helped launder $300,000 in two earlier schemes, prosecutors allege in an indictment released Friday. According to an FBI transcript of taped conversations, Silberman counted reputed underworld figure Chris Petti among his longtime associates, boasted of ways to hide income overseas and talked comfortably about deals worth tens of thousands of dollars being transacted with shoe boxes and the need to bring in mob "muscle" when one transaction went sour. "Just for your background, this is not my first go-around, OK?" Silberman allegedly told an undercover FBI agent last November. "I've been here before." Silberman and his wife, San Diego County Board of Supervisors Chairman Susan Golding, have declared his innocence. But the accusations, backed up by a richly detailed federal affidavit quoting wiretap conversations of Silberman, prompted bewilderment from friends and enemies alike as they struggled to understand what could have happened to one of San Diego's most prominent and powerful businessmen. Since his arrest, San Diegans have wondered aloud whether Silberman could possibly have been involved in such activities for years, as suggested by his wiretapped boasts. Is it possible that Silberman, a man often reported to be worth $25 million and thought to have the Midas touch, was forced into a foolish caper under pressure from recent financial reverses? Or, as some of Silberman's defenders ask, could it be that he was the victim of government overzealousness? Regardless, the accusations were especially surprising to those who knew Silberman's early political work. As a young businessman, Silberman had backed a series of reform candidates who toppled C. Arnholt Smith, a San Diego financier later convicted of grand theft and income-tax evasion, from power in the 1970s.  'So Unexpected' "To me, he always had that air of integrity and honesty about him," said A. David Stutz, a deputy district attorney who has known Silberman for nearly two decades. "I could never conceive of him being other than honest and having integrity. That goes back 18 years. That's always been my impression . . . until I picked up the newspaper." Today, however, Silberman is in jeopardy of joining Smith, J. David Dominelli and Roger Hedgecock on the roster of prominent San Diegans whose high esteem was transformed into ignominy through public or private transgressions. "This was so unexpected, so out of the blue, so out of character, that the shock was total," said Jack Canaan, a publicist who has known Silberman 20 years. "This is like somebody telling me that Steve Garvey -- Mr. Clean, Mr. Nice Guy -- was going out and getting a bunch of girls pregnant. This is like the Steve Garvey of the political and business world."  "We met people that he knew and, all of a sudden, I saw people in the world who did nothing but traded money. They didn't build amplifiers or TV sets. . . . In that process, LaMotte kind of opened my eyes to the world." -- Dick Silberman talking about business mentor and "second father," LaMotte T. Cohu, during a November, 1987, lecture given as part of a UC San Diego lecture series about entrepreneurs.  Dick Silberman was the son of two fathers. The first was Isadore Silberman, a Soviet immigrant who settled in San Diego in the late 1930s, collecting scraps of discarded clothing as rags for industrial use. Isadore Silberman inspired a special closeness with his only son. After Silberman separated from his first wife in 1973, he moved into an apartment down the hall from his father. For a vacation, Silberman once took his father on an excursion down the Yangtze River in China. Rabbi Michael Sternfield, who has known the Silberman family 16 years, said, "Dick treated his father with such tenderness and such respect, you don't forget something like this because you see it so rarely." Dick Silberman's second father inspired more awe than affection.  Sold Newspapers LaMotte T. Cohu was a world-wise veteran of the corporate suites -- former president of American Airlines, TWA, General Dynamics Convair Division, and Northrup Aircraft. He smoked a pipe, wore fancy blue suits and introduced his protege to fast sports cars and high finance. The introduction to Cohu came during the mid-1950s, a time when Silberman had already cut his entrepreneurial teeth on a number of home-grown business ventures that centered on his fascination with electronics. As a Hoover High School student and valedictorian during the waning days of World War II, Silberman would sell newspapers at 5th and University avenues to buy radio parts to support his habit of tinkering with the sets. When the first television sets came out, he made a deal with a San Diego appliance dealer to demonstrate the novelty by driving around town in a truck equipped with an antenna. Silberman and a friend started a "video service club," which charged television owners a $10 membership fee for a maintenance contract on the new appliances. Silberman said his company sold 2,000 memberships in one week after advertising on San Diego's first television station. "That was one of the most important experiences of my life because I learned that, if you advertise something, there's a lot of people who believe it," Silberman said during the UCSD lecture.  Degree in Physics Silberman earned his physics degree from then-San Diego State College and took a job with General Dynamics Convair Division after he graduated in 1950. The Atlas missile program was beginning, and Silberman cashed in on the Cold War defense boom by manufacturing small parts for the missile program. In the mid-1950s Silberman met Cohu, who had moved to San Diego for a restless retirement. In Cohu, Silberman found a major backer for his firm, whose name was eventually changed to Cohu Electronics. He also found a man he would call his "second father." "LaMotte helped, I guess in ways I can't even describe, in sort of giving me a view of the world," Silberman said. "The fellow knew everybody, and I knew nobody." Cohu's world featured a network of businessmen who traded money -- buying companies, merging them with others, taking private firms public. Silberman's next move was further into that world. He left Cohu and started Electronic Capital Corp. with partner Charles Salik, an investment firm that was a precursor to today's venture capital funds. Silberman also established an offshore company for the purposes of investing in European electronics companies. Though some of the investments made money, a series of losses prompted disgruntled board members to oust Silberman and Salik. The man who led the ouster was Jerome Kohlberg, who later became co-founder of the Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts buyout firm. Kohlberg said Friday that Silberman and Salik "milked" the companies by charging exorbitant management fees. Silberman, he said, was "a very personable, bright, facile, articulate person. I trusted him in the beginning and would never trust him again."  Important Business Ally In the early 1960s, Silberman found his most important business ally in Robert O. Peterson, founder of the Jack in the Box hamburger chain. "Within about 33 seconds, when Bob asked me what I did and he was telling me what he did, we developed a very long and deep and probably the most significant business relationship I've ever had," Silberman said in his lecture. Before long, Silberman was working with Peterson to find the right financing for the chain of 15 fast-food restaurants. Silberman urged Peterson to talk to Wall Street brokers about making a public offering. The result: Peterson sold 13% for $7.5 million. "I always used to describe Jack in the Box as a human vending machine," Silberman said in his lecture. "Basically, it allowed us to sell food for cash, have no accounts receivable and have no mechanical problems to fix with the vending machines because you have these humans there who are handing out the food." In 1968, Peterson and Silberman sold Jack in the Box to Ralston-Purina for $58 million after the hamburger chain grew to more than 500 outlets. Peterson and Silberman went on to engineer an unfriendly take-over of the Southern California First National Bank by acquiring a 22.8% controlling interest in stock. The coup was accomplished, in part, with the cooperation and money from banker C. Arnholt Smith, whose political lock on San Diego would later be broken by the pair. Their seven-year reign at the bank was marred by millions of dollars in bad loans. In the end, the banking venture wasn't the windfall that Jack in the Box had been; the pair basically broke even. Federal regulators were displeased with how Silberman and Peterson handled the sale of their federally chartered bank to the Bank of Tokyo in 1975, the first such sale to the Japanese.  Called by Regulators To avoid the scrutiny of federal regulators, the pair merged the bank with a state-chartered financial institution owned by the Japanese buyers. That would make the sale exempt from federal regulation, prompting a call from Federal Reserve Board officials. "They called us in and said, 'You know, this isn't illegal, but it's improper,' " Silberman recounted in his UCSD lecture. Then, he added with a wave of his hand: "Well, we gave it a lot of thought, and we sold the bank." In 1971, Silberman struck a deal with the state to renovate a rundown motel on the state's Old Town park. He and interior decorator Diane Powers were the only bidders for concession rights on the structure. With Silberman's money and Powers' decorating know-how, the motel was transformed over a decade into the Bazaar del Mundo tourist attraction, four restaurants and 16 shops so popular that it surpassed the Hearst Castle in San Simeon as the state's most lucrative concession. Yet the lease remained tiny, only $3,600 a year, giving Silberman and Powers a windfall on a project that by 1979 grossed $10 million. To avoid a possible conflict, Silberman sold his interest in the Bazaar to Powers before going to Sacramento in 1977 to join Brown's cabinet. Powers retained Silberman as a consultant and continued to make installment payments to him for his share in the business, even when he served as state business and transportation secretary -- a post that gave him authority over the bazaar's four liquor licenses. Silberman failed to disclose his financial ties to Powers while lobbying state legislators on her behalf in mid-1981, after he left state employ. "This is an insult to me because he specifically told me . . . that he had no interest in this whatsoever," one lawmaker said. The state renegotiated Powers' lease so she would pay 4.5% of the Bazaar's gross, a figure that translated into more than $500,000 in 1982. In recent years it is not clear that Silberman has repeated his financial success of the 1960s and 1970s. His major venture has been Yuba Natural Resources, a gold-mining project in Marysville. Among the partners in the project were hotelier M. Larry Lawrence, former national Democratic Party Chairman Charles Manatt and J. David Dominelli, the La Jolla financier who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. Under Silberman's direction, Yuba has lost more than $6 million in the last five years. Federal securities reports and state court records show that Yuba faced lawsuits from creditors and a $515,000 judgment from the federal government for dredging for gold on land it did not own. In his scramble for new investors and capital, Silberman, one lawsuit alleges, raised money by selling off mining equipment that Yuba actually had leased from another company. "The fact is that you couldn't make a deal with the guy that was fair," said Herbert Caplan, president of U.S. Machinery Co., which owned the mining equipment. "He had to get that extra inch. He had to feel within himself that he had gotten the better of you." In recent years, Silberman and Golding disposed of much of their extensive real estate holdings. Moreover, with Golding seriously contemplating a campaign for lieutenant governor next year -- plans that most political observers now expect to be dropped -- Silberman faced the prospect of probably needing to raise or contribute several million dollars to that race. "It looks like everything was closing in on the guy," publicist Canaan said. "He's got a mining operation that's like something out of Abbott and Costello, his wife wants to run for lieutenant governor, he's selling off his property. . . . And, all of a sudden, everything just blows up." "My life (has) given me a rare opportunity to manage $30 billion, and I really understand the arrogance of power. When I was the (state) director of finance, it was fabulous. . . . Being in government and signing off on $30-billion budgets and having discretionary accounts that you have to approve and being involved in negotiations with the federal government where you tell them you will or will not take their $2 billion -- the zeroes are fabulous! It's an incredible experience." -- Richard Silberman, Nov. 12, 1987, lecture to UC San Diego program. If Silberman ended his most active political days marveling at the "zeroes" that he controlled with his pen, he was first drawn to politics for quite different reasons. Indeed, of the many ironies inherent in Silberman's current situation, perhaps none is greater than the fact that he entered politics as a good-government crusader determined to clean up local government and, as one associate put it, "sweep out the crooks." In 1970, Silberman and a handful of other prominent businessmen -- among them Peterson, who later would become the husband of San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor -- helped Edwin Miller Jr. win the district attorney's office in a bitter race that marked the beginning of the end for the old-boy network that for decades had controlled San Diego.  'Expose It' Around the same time, Silberman and Peterson approached A. David Stutz, now a deputy district attorney and then a young Treasury agent, with an unusual proposal to leave his government post and become a San Diego "ombudsman" responsible for publicly exposing corruption. They offered to pay his salary, supply an office and a staff and guaranteed him the freedom to investigate even the most sacred cows of the San Diego Establishment. "What would happen if I found something about you two?" Stutz recalled asking. "Both of them, without hesitation, said, 'Expose it.' " That plan fizzled, but Silberman continued dabbling in local politics, backing candidates ranging from his good friend Jack Walsh to then-Democratic City Councilwoman O'Connor and Republican Mayor Pete Wilson. Silberman himself served in a variety of appointed positions in local government, including the city school board, the Stadium Authority, the downtown redevelopment board and the transit authority. Silberman became one of Wilson's closest confidants, forming, along with newspaper publisher Helen Copley, the triumvirate that sat atop San Diego's power structure. But in the mid-1970s, Silberman abruptly broke with Wilson to help Gov. Brown, whom Wilson hoped to unseat as governor in 1978. For Silberman, it was only one of several notable changes of political allegiance that led to inevitable questions about his motives. In one particularly messy shift that left hard feelings on all sides, Silberman pushed his political protege Lynn Schenk into a 1984 San Diego County supervisorial race, then married and bankrolled Schenk opponent Golding, whose campaign lambasted Schenk for having served under Brown -- ironically, in the position for which Silberman had recruited her. A slander lawsuit that Schenk filed shortly after Golding's victory was settled out of court last fall with Schenk agreeing to accept $150,000 from Golding's insurance company.  Glitzy Winners Though defenders saw the ease with which Silberman moved between parties and individuals as skillful political pragmatism, others viewed it as a lack of ideological commitment and loyalty, an interest more in being associated with glitzy winners than in their philosophy. "What happened with that Jerry Brown-Pete Wilson thing was that Dick simply decided that he'd rather have the governor of California as a friend than the mayor of San Diego," said former state Sen. President Pro Tem James Mills (D-San Diego). "He was a political celebrity freak to a certain extent. He wasn't very interested in helping anyone who wasn't a big fish. I think he approached those decisions, not out of principle, but in terms of what it meant for Dick Silberman." In Sacramento, the dark-haired, mustachioed Silberman moved quickly through a series of posts in the Brown Administration, where he came to be seen as an island of steady calm in a sea of chaos. "He brought a little sanity to the place," recalled B. T. Collins, himself one of Brown's top advisers. More importantly, no other adviser -- not Collins, not longtime chief of staff Gray Davis, not gubernatorial guru Jacques Barzaghi -- came close to performing the role for Brown that Silberman did. "Jerry was out of it concerning the way the world worked," remembered another confidant. "Dick was mature, sophisticated and could open major doors to the business community, which thought Jerry was from Mars." In Brown's eyes, Silberman represented something that he himself was not but very much needed: a trusted counselor who understood the concerns, needs and agendas of business people and -- equally important -- the nuts and bolts of how to make things work. As a bonus, Silberman also knew how to tap business for big bucks to finance political campaigns. Silberman displayed those talents as the fund-raiser for Brown's belated 1976 five-primary presidential campaign that, though quixotic from the start, threw a serious scare into Jimmy Carter's run for the White House. The week that Carter was inaugurated, Silberman assembled 35 major corporation executives in New York for a luncheon with Brown aimed at turning around his anti-business image.  Named Finance Director Sufficiently impressed, Brown asked Silberman -- then 48 years old -- to run the Business and Transportation Agency in early 1977. "There was a little bit of senior gray hair in Dick that Jerry could bounce things off of, as opposed to the 'Brownies' who were young and inexperienced," one close aide recalled. After serving briefly as Brown's chief of staff during the governor's successful 1978 reelection campaign, Silberman was appointed state finance director, the person in charge of preparing the state budget. During his Senate confirmation hearings, Silberman weathered mild controversy stemming from his role in arranging contributions to the unsuccessful 1978 reelection campaign of Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally from two men with alleged underworld links: $10,000 from Las Vegas casino owner Allen Glick, of La Jolla, and $5,000 from Irv Roston of the La Costa Land Co. Though Brown himself publicly chided Silberman for a lack of "prudence" in soliciting the donations, the controversy quickly dissipated and had been largely forgotten until the FBI affidavit alleged longtime ties to Petti. Petti's attorney, Oscar Goodman, describes his client's relationship with Silberman as "not as much a social friendship as a case of two guys sharing the same company frequently . . . in excess of 10 years." However, in more than a dozen interviews with people close to Silberman, none was aware that he even knew Petti. "That's the kind of thing I find it hard to believe you wouldn't have heard gossip about," said local banker Murray Galinson, a longtime political activist who was a top national staffer on Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign. "But there was never a whisper, never a rumor." As often happens in the wake of such a stunning development, Silberman's political image already has undergone some preliminary historical revisionism. While claiming not to be trying to distance the party from Silberman, many Democrats nevertheless have gone to lengths to point out that the "major Democratic fund-raiser" description that usually preceded his name in news stories overlooks the fact that he also has been a prominent supporter of Republicans such as Wilson and Golding.  A Selected Few "I always thought Dick Silberman was less of a major Democratic activist than he was an activist for a selected few candidates," said Phil Connor, former local Democratic Party chairman. "His style was to pick his horses carefully and then ride them." Silberman seldom contributed to the local and state Democratic candidates, and party leaders were privately chagrined that Silberman usually failed to do some of the perfunctory things expected of high-rollers, such as buying tables at party fund-raising functions. Just as Silberman found it difficult to duplicate his early business success, so too did his political star wane after he returned to San Diego in the early 1980s. Other than lending $243,000 to Golding's 1984 campaign against Schenk -- nearly half of her total contributions -- Silberman has maintained a relatively low political profile over the past 6 1/2 years. Silberman provided perhaps the best description of his "life after Jerry Brown." "When you have been supposedly the czar of roads and S&Ls and banks and corporations and houses, and you come back to earth and you come back home to San Diego, it's amazing how seldom your phone rings," Silberman said in his 1987 UCSD lecture. "It's amazing how unimportant you are, and it's amazing how fast the reality hits you. "Thank God, I generally look at life as something you should laugh (at), and for four or five or six months, I laughed about the reality that all of a sudden not being in Sacramento sort of took the veneer off. And I was back to who I was, and that did not involve all those zeroes." "In the age of being careful of who you quote and what you say and where you went to school and who your father was, and whether you did or didn't work in the coal mine, one has to be particularly careful. I must say, I have a great deal of security in my past life because I love living in a country where the FBI can't find marijuana on Harvard's campus. I feel much safer now after the Ginsburg affair." -- Silberman, UCSD lecture, speaking about U.S. Supreme Court nominee Douglas Ginsburg, whose 1987 nomination was withdrawn after it was learned that, while on the faculty of the Harvard Law School, he had smoked marijuana. Of course, Ginsburg never lit up with an FBI agent in the room, which is tantamount to what Silberman allegedly did in the money-laundering case. According to the FBI, Silberman stumbled into an undercover sting set up during the latter stages of the agency's 2 1/2-year investigation into organized-crime operations in Southern California and Nevada. Last October, Petti unknowingly approached an FBI informer and an undercover agent, telling them that he had a "wealthy associate" -- Silberman -- who perhaps could help launder money. Over the next six months, prosecutors allege that Silberman either used or discussed various methods -- among them, a stock swap involving a mining company he controlled, the purchase of U.S. Treasury bonds and wiring cash to foreign banks -- to launder money that he was told originated with Colombian cocaine dealers. In a 76-page affidavit, federal prosecutors portray Silberman's alleged role in those schemes with vivid details that sound as if they were drawn from a Hollywood script: cash stuffed in shoe boxes, Swiss accounts, clandestine meetings in hotels and restaurants, transactions recorded by concealed cameras, and threats of bringing in Petti's "muscle" when a deal went sour. "Part of this, believe it or not, is . . . as much for your protection as mine," Silberman said in one taped conversation, explaining why he preferred to use couriers to pick up the money. "There's no place I can walk and not believe that someone might recognize me. . . . As I say, I've done it 15 or 20 times, it works like absolute, clean, uninterrupted, greased lightning." The affidavit also alleges that undercover agents repeatedly talked about the source of the money being Colombian drug traffickers and that Silberman was uncomfortable when the words were used. "Let's not even, uh, use any of the words anymore, OK?" Silberman allegedly said at one point.  'You Always Wonder' Though Silberman's friends note that only one side of the story has been heard to date, even some of those closest to him admit that they are shocked by what the FBI tapes are reported to contain. "I guess you always wonder about entrapment in a case like this," one lawyer said. "But the question in my mind is, even if that happened, why didn't he just walk away from the thing? Some of the most damning words come out of his own mouth." Were those the words of a man who, as one friend termed it, "put on moral blinders" because of dire financial difficulties? If so, was it an isolated misstep or simply the only one uncovered? "A shock like this forces you to reevaluate everything," said longtime political activist George Mitrovich. "Yesterday's truth becomes today's question mark. . . . Dick Silberman has done a lot of terrific things for this community. Even if any of this is true, that doesn't change. But it makes you wonder about things you didn't wonder about before." Contributing to this report were Times staff writers Jenifer Warren, Richard A. Serrano and Chris Kraul in San Diego and Daniel M. Weintraub and George Skelton in Sacramento.
19890503000000000	HUTTENBACK STILL COLLECTING PAY AT SANTA BARBARA. Ten months after being convicted of embezzling about $250,000 in campus funds to renovate his private home, former UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Robert Huttenback is still being paid about $6,800 a month by the university. Huttenback was suspended indefinitely last September from his post as a tenured professor in the history department, and a campus discipline review process was initiated to determine his future. Almost an entire school year later, no decision has been made, and Huttenback continues to draw his salary. Many professors and students have expressed outrage that the university Huttenback embezzled funds from should continue to pay his salary. And, they say, during a period of budget cutbacks on campus, Huttenback's $81,700-a-year salary is sorely needed for other campus programs. "This year there are 2,400 freshmen who are unable to take required freshman English courses because the university is too short of money to provide those courses," said John Reiff, who teaches freshman composition. "So it's terribly puzzling and distressing to pay a convicted felon for not teaching." After Huttenback was suspended, a faculty committee, following campus regulations, began reviewing his case in order to make a recommendation to Chancellor Barbara Uehling. Huttenback's suspension at full pay "was not an arbitrary matter," said John Myers, chairman of the five-member Committee of Privilege and Tenure. All suspended professors, according to the faculty code of conduct, he said, must be given full pay while their future is determined. The committee has not yet made a recommendation to the chancellor, he said, because "this is a very complicated matter that has to be done with a great deal of thought. A person's reputation and livelihood are at stake. Something like this has to be done carefully with due regard to all parties." But other faculty members said a decision should have been made long ago. "There's no way to defend this kind of foot-dragging. . . ," said Thomas Harding, a professor of anthropology. "The university should at least hold his salary in escrow until this whole thing's resolved. . . . "I have a friend who's a member of a tennis club in town, and whenever he sees Huttenback playing tennis he's furious. Huttenback's getting paid and all he's doing is playing tennis." A number of faculty members and students say the university has a responsibility to resolve the matter quickly. "This is not the kind of example the university should be setting for young people," said Gerald Horne, chairman of the black studies department. "Students read about Watergate and the Teapot Dome scandal in their classes. So when they see $81,000 handed out to a person involved in another scandal, it sends the wrong message to them. This kind of thing breeds cynicism." Huttenback resigned as chancellor in July, 1986, after controversy erupted over his expenditures on his home, but he continued to teach history at the university. He was later convicted of embezzlement and income tax evasion in connection with the funds spent on his home, but was spared a prison sentence. He was ordered to pay a $60,000 fine, serve five years' probation and perform 1,000 hours of community service. Huttenback, who is appealing his conviction, still faces several levels of review before his future at the university is determined. Even if the faculty committee decides that Huttenback should be demoted or dismissed and Chancellor Uehling accepts the committee's recommendation, the University of California regents must make the final decision on Huttenback's teaching future. Javier LaFianza, president of the UC Santa Barbara student body, said students are incensed that Huttenback's future at the university has taken so long to resolve. "The faculty has been talking about this for eight months and they're no closer to a decision than when they started," LaFianza said. "It's disgraceful that we continue to pay a man who has been convicted of stealing from us."
19890514000000000	BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; HERR MAKING DODGERS' CLAIRE LOOK GOOD. Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers and baseball's executive of the year in 1988, apparently was right again when he tabbed Tom Herr to replace Steve Sax as the club's second baseman. Herr is batting .341, second in the National League to Will Clark. Unfortunately for Claire and the Dodgers, though, Herr is doing it with the Philadelphia Phillies. He rejected the Dodgers' offers to sign with the team closest to his hometown, Lancaster, Pa. Claire had been so convinced that he was about to sign Herr that he had the publicity department prepare a news release. "Fred did everything he could to sign me," Herr said the other day. "At one point he even said, 'What will it take to get you to come here?' In essence, he was saying I could write my own contract. "It was hard to pass up and my wife and I spent a lot of time talking about it. I'd have probably gone if I was younger, but at this point in my career we felt that a major family move like that wasn't in our best interest." Herr, 33, signed a two-year contract at $825,000 a year with the Phillies. Claire then made a futile offer to Ron Oester, who remained with the Cincinnati Reds; tried in vain to trade for Wally Backman, whom the New York Mets later traded to the Minnesota Twins, and finally signed New York Yankee free agent Willie Randolph, now hitting .226. "Everything about the Dodger offer was better than the Phillies' offer," Herr said. "From a pure business standpoint, I was foolish to pass it up. And from a professional standpoint, I was rejecting a club that had a chance to win again. But those considerations just weren't at the top of my priority list when weighed against the value I placed on playing at home." Herr is a .273 lifetime hitter who spent eight-plus seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, contributing to three pennant winners with bat, glove and a quiet intensity that is now said to have contributed to a new attitude in the Philadelphia clubhouse. "Nobody expects him to keep hitting what he's hitting now, but even if he hits .300 it won't be close to the No. 1 thing he's brought to this team," pitcher Don Carman said. "What he's brought to this team is the idea of what it takes to be a winning club." Defined by Carman: A strengthening of relationships on and off the field. Herr has his personal goals as well. Traded to Minnesota for Tom Brunansky last year, then sidelined twice by a leg injury, he wants to erase the memory of a .263 average with the Twins and the negativity that accompanied it. "I came here feeling I was on a personal mission," Herr said. "I read a lot of reports that I was slowing down, that I wasn't the player I once was. There was a lot of negative press in Minnesota. I wanted to reverse that sentiment and I worked harder than I ever have during the winter." Can he keep it up? Can he continue to hit .341? That might have been easier with a defending World Series winner like the Dodgers, who figure to be more of a pennant threat than the Phillies. "There's excitement every day when your team's in the race," Herr said. "It's harder to get up when it's not. It's harder to go out there with the same intensity. My off years have coincided with my team's off years and I can't ignore that." Mike Schmidt also rejected the Dodgers to stay with the Phillies. He has talked about how he was romanced by Tom Lasorda at a time when he was coming off shoulder surgery for a torn rotator cuff and it appeared he might have to play first base rather than third. The Dodgers eventually traded for Eddie Murray, and Schmidt, saluting the acquisition of a younger, switch-hitting superstar willing to move, returned to third base at Veterans Stadium, removing the cynics' doubts in the process. At 39, Schmidt has driven in 24 runs and hit six homers for a career total of 548. He says he is 99.9% sure that this will be his last year, that the lure of joining Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays as the only players to have hit 600 homers is not strong enough to make him continue. "If everything broke right I might, but I'm ready to move on, to get the ball rolling in another direction," he said. "I've had a great run and I'm grateful for that and the money I've made, but it's time to start leading a normal life. "I'm still a damn good hitter but only an adequate player and I don't have the get up and go I once had. I've had four knee operations and several other operations. There's been a lot of wear and tear. "I mean, I'll be 40 when the season is over and, God willing, I'll have another 40 years. Hopefully, there's another position for me in baseball." Schmidt mentioned managing, broadcasting, the front office. His ultimate choice? "I'd like to move to Florida and run an expansion club," he said. If, indeed, this is Schmidt's last year, he will leave with the satisfaction of having come back from the shoulder injury but the frustration of having been caught in a rebuilding process. So close, but yet so far, he said of the Phillies, who have won only one game in which they scored fewer than five runs. "We do have a great offensive team," he said. "If we had a pitching staff with the horses that the Dodgers do, we might walk away with it. Pitchers win the games, the pennants, the World Series." Two veteran members of the Kansas City Royals are also weighing their futures. George Brett, recovering from torn knee ligaments, isn't sure he wants to risk another injury on what he perceives to be a dangerous carpet at Royals Stadium. He may ask to become a designated hitter or to be traded. Willie Wilson, 33, batting .180 with an on-base percentage of .255 before a weekend series with the Texas Rangers, isn't sure he still has a baseball future. "I'm totally frustrated now," the center fielder said. "I feel lousy before, during and after the game. If this continues I don't know what the answer is. I don't know whether I'm just losing some skills or am too old, period." Said Brett: "I remember the first words I said to (Royal management after his latest injury). I told them they could take this turf and stick it. I'll never play on it for the rest of my life." He may not have a choice, however. "How can I get off the stuff when I have four years left on my contract?" he said. "I have a lot of thinking to do. We'll see what happens." One of baseball's procedural rules will be satisfied by the May 25 hearing that Pete Rose and his attorneys have been invited to by commissioner Bart Giammati. But there is another rule, if violated, that could form the basis for a due-process suit that Rose is believed to be considering if he is suspended for gambling activities. Rose has the right to cross-examine witnesses, but most of the testimony against him is believed to come from several men who are serving prison sentences, or soon will be, for felonies such as drug trafficking and income tax evasion. Will those witnesses be called to the hearing? "It's a possibility," deputy commissioner Fay Vincent said. "The decision will be made on what happens between now and then." The San Diego Padres' spring optimism has faded amid the futility of their offense. The Padres need that one more hitter they keep pursuing -- Jim Presley, Wade Boggs, Dale Murphy, Lenny Dykstra -- but can't land. Jack Clark, the one hitter they did land, was batting .200 before a weekend series in New York, but the more telling statistic is that he led the National League in walks. The hitters who were asked to protect Clark, batting behind him, were hitting a combined .179. All-Star catcher Benito Santiago was hitting .204, John Kruk was on the disabled list and, as a team, the Padres were 11th in the league, leading only the Dodgers, with a batting average of .231. "We went into the season telling our pitchers to hold teams to three runs and we'd win," Manager Jack McKeon said. "The way we're going, we better hold them to one." Added Clark: "Now we know why (former manager) Larry Bowa made out 96 different lineups." Despite denials, the New York Mets are apparently still tantalized by the potential availability of Seattle Mariner left-hander Mark Langston but concerned that Langston would want a larger contract than Dwight Gooden, who received $6.7 million for three years. "I wouldn't care, give it to him," said Gooden. "The $6.7 million is what I asked for. In a couple years, I'll be knocking on the door again anyway." Shortstop Ozzie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals is in the final year of a four-year, $8 million contract, a $2-million average, of course. The Cardinals have offered the same average in a two-year, $4-million extension. Smith, however, contends that he is being asked to take a cut based on his actual 1989 salary of $2.2 million. He also wants a three-year deal and says he will need more money to accept a two. "I don't think I've done anything to warrant being cut," he said. The challenging position resulting from the Chicago Cubs' strong start is likely to prove temporary while right fielder Andre Dawson recovers from knee surgery and center fielder Jerome Walton rehabilitates a torn hamstring. Dawson and Walton went down on successive days last week, leaving the Cubs a powerless outfield of Mitch Webster, Dwight Smith and Doug Dascenzo, and leaving General Manager Jim Frey convinced that estimates of the farm system's rebirth under predecessor Dallas Green have been significantly overstated. Frey's view is that the cupboard is bare except for a few pitchers and position players, all built along the lines of the 5-foot-8 Dascenzo and 5-11 Smith. When Cardinal reliever Dan Quisenberry batted for only the third time in his career the other day against San Francisco, he picked up his front foot while swinging. "Mel Ott did it and it worked for him," Quisenberry said. "Of course, I wasn't sure I was picking up the right foot."
