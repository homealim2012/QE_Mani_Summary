19920314000000000	FT  14 MAR 92 / Schools, the debate rages: Andrew Adonis summarises reaction to last week's FT-500 survey. 'I WELCOME your survey', wrote Peter Wilkes, headmaster of Cheltenham College, 'as it highlights many areas which parents should properly investigate.' That was the general response to last week's FT-500 survey of independent schools. It came with a flurry of letters debating our conclusions and methodology - and suggesting improvements for next time. There were also a number of slips, a few caused by us but most by errors - or confusion - in completing our questionnaire. Those brought to our attention are noted below: they and others will be incorporated in the booklet of the survey to be published in due course. The issue of co-education attracted the widest response. We used - and should have explained clearly - two different criteria. The main table, intended as a general guide to parents, classified schools as co-ed if they admitted both sexes at all levels, regardless of the proportions. But the summary table of the top 10 co-educational schools, on page two of our supplement, applied a more exacting test: schools were eligible for inclusion only where more than a quarter of their pupils were boys and more than a quarter girls. Most schools without that mix have the minority sex - almost invariably girls - in their sixth forms only, and we did not consider that an institution with only a few of the minority sex in the lower school was fully co-ed. Tony Evans, head of Portsmouth Grammar School - which was ranked correctly as 61st in the main table, not sixth as stated in one article  - argues that such an approach 'does not take into account the different stages which schools have reached in co-education: some are completely co-ed; others are in the process of becoming so.' Moreover, 'it fails to take account of the highly selective nature, and the monopoly enjoyed by many, if not all, of those schools which you cite as illustrating the merits of single-sex schools.' This, no doubt, is true. A corollary is that some schools, at least, have gone co-ed because of difficulties in recruiting and/or maintaining standards while single-sex. The survey offers strong prima facie evidence for such a view. However, it does not affect our conclusion: that a disproportionate share of the best schools, academically, are single-sex. It does not, of course, follow that a system of single-sex education is inherently better. The wide variation in fees, and the weakness of evident links between fees and performance, struck many readers. One was anxious to stress that fees of up to Pounds 11,000 a year in the public boarding schools represented only the 'headline cost.' With two sons at a boarding school and a daughter at a day school, his fees totalled Pounds 8,495 a term. Yet, with school trips, sports equipment, societies, and other extras charged by the schools, the bill rose to Pounds 9,575 a term - another Pounds 3,240 a year. Inevitably, our criteria for the rank-ordering attracted criticism. It gave equal weight to the average A-level performance per pupil, and the average performance per entry. Some readers objected to our use of the first measure, others to the second. David May, of St Paul's School, London, wanted AS levels to be included and questioned whether the breadth of a curriculum could be related to the number of A-levels taken. 'This may well be true (or it may not be), but there is no way of judging the issue from the mere statistics,' he wrote. The inclusion of general studies in the calculation of A-level scores was questioned. This was partly because some heads believe GS is of a lower standard and could be used to push up the scores of weaker schools, but also because its inclusion was thought to be unfair to schools with broad but unexamined curriculum-enrichment programmes. 'It places quantity above quality,' says Averil Burgess, of South Hampstead High School, London. We did compile a ranking which excluded general studies, but concluded from a comparison of the two ranks that there was no convincing evidence that the inclusion of general studies was systematically distorting. Some schools with many good grades in general studies gained an advantage, but they tended to be the better schools for other subjects. Others, where pupils tended to fail or gain low grades in general studies, lost position. But consistently poor performance in this exam could well reflect on the standard of all-round education in these sixth forms. In future, we could consider publishing both ranks. The issue of 'value added' was discussed widely. All respondents agreed that the range of information offered - plus the profiles and articles elsewhere in the supplement - gave it a higher prominence than in previous surveys. But some still thought us too wedded to 'raw' A-level results. James Miller, headmaster of Framlingham College, Suffolk, described ranking by A-level scores as 'analogous in commercial terms to saying that dividend yield is the best measure of the quality of management in a company.' He wanted a comparison of A-level scores with GCSE results. On this basis, he claimed, Framlingham came fourth, not 22nd, in a study of 24 schools by the Headmasters' Conference. He, at any rate, still favoured ranking by exam results. Others deplored even that, emphasising the equal - or greater - importance of the extra-curricular side. That, however, did not cut much ice with Cheltenham's Peter Wilkes. He stressed the importance of a school's 'mood' and facilities, but added: 'I have always found the tendency of headmasters to boast and glorify their schools' achievements very distasteful. John Cleese's parody of this tendency in Clockwise has, sadly, not had much effect upon us. I hope that most of today's parents look beyond the booming bluster.' The absence of a commentary on the Scottish results attracted criticism and is something we will rectify in any future survey. Mrs DA Gardner, headmistress of Wellington School, Ayr, claimed it was 'spurious' to give average Highers' scores per pupil without any indication of the number of Highers achieved. But the headmaster of Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh, believed it might be useful to divide the Scottish section in two, between those schools following a broadly 'English' curriculum based on A-levels and those concentrating on Highers. We have recalculated our table incorporating new information supplied to us, but the changed places given below should be regarded as provisional only since revisions are still being sent to us. ERRATA It is Bryanston (not Brynston) and Cheadle Hulme (not Hume). St Anne's, Windermere, is in Cumbria, not Lancashire. Winchester does not have a co-ed sixth form, just the daughters of four members of staff there. The Queen's School, Chester, is for girls, not boys as listed in one table. 'There are those at The King's School, Chester, who would love this to happen: don't give them ideas]' wrote the headmistress. Errors in the hand collation of summary tables led to the omission of three schools from the 'top 10' tables for co-educational and boarding schools. We apologise to Stockport Grammar, which should have come top of the co-ed table; to The King's School, Canterbury, which should have come third; and to Charterhouse, which, on our present information, should have ranked 10th in the boarding table. Revised tables will be reprinted when we have completed the checking and recalculation of new data. Badminton (not Badmington) had 34, not 46, A-level candidates last year. This gives it a Universities Central Council for Admissions points score per pupil of 20.06, and per entry of 6.69. Accordingly, it rises from 211th to 118th place. (UCCA scores grade A=10, B=8, C=6,D=4, E=2). Epsom College, Surrey, overstated its number of A-level candidates at 155. The corrected figure of 135 takes its UCCA score per candidate up to 20.90, and per entry to 6.92. It rises from 141st to 83rd. Forest School, London, has a revised pupil:teacher ratio of 11.2:1, and an average of 3.4 passes per pupil. Its revised UCCA score per pupil is 22.58, and per entry 6.28, taking it to 96th position. Notting Hill and Ealing High, London, had a score per pupil of 19.97, and per entry of 6.94, giving it 98th place. Sevenoaks School, Kent, was not ranked because a third of its pupils take the International Baccalaureate instead of A-levels. Using an agreed formula for converting IB scores, it had an UCCA score per pupil of 20.75, and per entry of 6.77. It takes 95th place. Solihull School, West Midlands, which completed a form after publication, has a score per pupil of 24.52, and per entry of 6.18, giving it 72nd place. The Perse School, Cambridge, which advised us that it achieved one extra grade A and one more grade B pass than declared on its form, gets a revised score of 24.63 per pupil and 7.88 per entry, pushing it up from 23rd to 19th. St Bede's College, Manchester, had 947, not 347, pupils, giving it 61 per cent boys and a pupil:teacher ratio of 13.5:1. The fees at Laxton, Northants, are Pounds 4,200 a year, not Pounds 11,790. At Whitgift, Surrey, they are Pounds 4,400 per year, not per term. At Francis Holland, London, 80 per cent-plus (not 54) go on to higher education, and a similar proportion do so at St Helen and St Katherine's, Abingdon, and Belmont House, Glasgow. And, yes, the FT's proof-readers have done 300 lines on each of: Surrey, boarders, Channel Islands, Guernsey and Shropshire. 'Borders and full borders are worthy of Daisy Ashford or Richmal Crompton,' wrote Geoffrey Elliott from Bermuda. 'But perhaps that's all you get nowadays for several thousand pounds a year in fees.'
19920307000000000	FT  07 MAR 92 / What price the old school tie now?: The FT-500 schools survey, out today, is the widest analysis of private education yet published. Full and controversial details in out special supplement. WHATEVER its social cachet, the old public school tie is no longer a reliable guide to top-notch academic performance. Eton, Winchester and Westminster vie with the leading independent grammar schools in Birmingham, Portsmouth, Chester and Manchester for the top slots in the FT-500 survey of independent schools. Famous names languish far below: Rugby 94th, Marlborough 108th, Lancing 178th, Stowe 271st. Ties apart, the FT survey shows single-sex and day schools largely outstripping their boarding and co-educational partners, and a poor relationship between fees and results at all levels. The FT-500 survey of independent schools, published today in a special supplement, is the most comprehensive analysis of the private education sector yet published. It includes almost all institutions belonging to the Headmasters' Conference and the Girls' Schools Association. It features a ranking of schools by all A-level results, not just top grades. But it is far more than a league table: a mass of information is given on each school, from fees to teacher: pupil ratios and broad subject specialisation. To that extent, readers can make their own estimate of 'value added.' The tables are arranged by county, with a separate listing for Scotland. Our survey shows the top 50 independent schools in England and Wales (Scotland's separate exam system prevents direct comparison) achieving outstanding academic results. The top 50 secured an average A-level grade of 'B' or higher and/or the point-equivalent of at least three passes at grade 'B'. In the country as a whole, only 27 per cent of passes were graded 'A' or 'B' last year. Among the next 200-odd, competition is fierce, with A-level results good and tiny gaps separating school scores. Differences between them have more to do with fees, facilities and ethos than rankings in the exam scoreboard. At the bottom, however, about 60 institutions turn out poor or indifferent academic results. Some have compensating strengths, but many face an uncertain future. It should come as no surprise, then, that the independent sector's grip on the leading universities is so tight. And tightening. The proportion of Oxford university's admission for this October coming from independent schools is up from 48.2 to 48.6 per cent - while the state sector, which educates three-quarters of the nation's sixth- formers, has to make do with 42.8 per cent (the rest were mostly from overseas). Three-quarters of next year's Oxford entrants gained at least 2 'As' and one 'B' at A-level. At 14 independent schools the average A-level score per pupil was thereabouts or higher. Father Dominic Milroy, headmaster of Ampleforth and chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, told his fellow HMC heads recently of his 'suspicion of the invasion of education by the language of the market'. A school leaver was neither a client nor a finished product - comments on which he elaborates in an interview in the supplement. In reality, however, he or she is both, so far as a school is concerned. The corollary is equally clear. As Martin Stephen, Headmaster of the Perse School, Cambridge, puts it: 'We have to look very hard at ourselves, work out clearly what it is we are offering that is worth Pounds 3,600 a year, and then make sure that parents and pupils know what it is.' What is it, then? Stephen had no doubt: high-quality teaching and results, first and foremost; but discipline, facilities and extra-curricular activities - sporting, musical and cultural  - not far behind. Developing and marketing such wares is now the preoccupation of the typical independent school head. Some go about it more energetically than others. David Pardey, an educational marketing consultant, tells his clients that the first essential to selling a school is 'SWOT analysis': an audit of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats within a school, leading to a 'marketing plan' complete with targets and strategies. SWOT or not, most schools are doing it all the same. The strengths of particular schools are not always clear from the FT-500 table, since facilities and extra-curricular activities are missing. It nonetheless offers some interesting correlations between what you get and what you pay for. First, results bear little relation to pupil-staff ratios. Across the sector, schools are generally within the 8:1 and 14:1 range. But most day schools are nearer the 14, whatever their A-level performance - which puts them not far behind the 15:1 average for state secondary schools. It may be that the typical private school teacher is more committed than his or her state counterpart; but it is selectivity, buildings, equipment and extra-curricular activities, not more staff, that most parents are paying for. Typically, 60 per cent of a school's budget goes on teaching staff, and the impact is clear when comparing fees and staff ratios in day schools. It is less evident among boarding schools. Taking five boarding schools with fees of around Pounds 11,000 a year at random, the pupil:teacher ratio is 9.3:1; selecting five with fees around Pounds 7,500 yields a ratio of only 9:1. There is, therefore, no straightforward link between what you get and what you pay for: neither in terms of results, nor of facilities (given the unequal endowment of institutions). The FT-500's three top schools, all day grammar schools, have fees of around Pounds 3,300 a year; the day fees of their more prestigious 'public' counterparts like Winchester, Westminster, Shrewsbury and Charterhouse lie between Pounds 7,000 and Pounds 9,000. True, of the top 20 boarding schools, 15 have fees higher than Pounds 9,000 a year, while of bottom 20, 14 have fees lower than Pounds 9,000. Yet average fees in the top four schools taking day pupils are only three-quarters as high as those in the bottom four to do so. The tables might also lead you to question another piece of conventional wisdom: that if only the state system would pull up its socks, private schools would be the preserve of 'snobs and eccentrics,' as Labour's education spokesman Jack Straw puts it. Consider Kent. It has clung on to 28 grammar schools, and has one of the highest state-sector university entrance and achievement rates in the UK. Yet it also sustains 26-plus independent secondary schools and, according to the tables, most are far from high-flying. By contrast, comprehensive Avon and Lancashire manage only 19 and 22 respectively. Even if state schools improve, a substantial private sector is with us for the forseeable future. There is, at all events, no political threat to it - certainly not from Straw, who is these days as likely as Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, to be the star speaker at gatherings of independent heads. If anything, the threat to the sector comes not from independence, but excessive dependence on the state. The assisted places scheme, set up by the government a decade ago to pay fees for children from low-income families, now pays all or part of the fees of 7 per cent of private pupils. It has become bread and butter for a significant minority of schools. Our survey shows the dependent to be mostly the big city day schools - and the likes of Dulwich, Manchester and Newcastle grammars could fill their places without them. But a fair few are less favourably placed, and if Labour cuts their lifeline later this year, expect to hear cries of woe - or worse. By then, they may have been brought on by the recession anyway. Stories of retrenchment, redundancies - even pupils being withdrawn  - are legion, particularly among boarding schools, for whom demand is falling steadily. But all schools face difficulties in deciding whether or not to meet a state teachers' pay settlement at twice the rate of inflation. A study earlier this year by Monmouth School revealed almost two-thirds of its parents as having pre-tax salaries of Pounds 40,000 or less. There may not be much fat left. Rationalisation is starting: Malvern College, facing declining rolls and little prospect of improving them in rural Worcestershire, is about to merge with both a local girls' school and a prep school - giving it a tied-entry and co-education in one bound. Joint ventures with local businesses to improve sports facilities are common; so are commercial activities in the holidays. Marlborough is marketing a summer school offering more than 70 courses from art, Anglo-Saxon and architecture to woodcrafts. However, private schools are concerned not only about the recession, marketing and investing in marketable facilities: relations with the state sector are also a high priority. Even without assisted places, other changes are working to blur the state/independent divide more than at any time since the end of the direct-grant regime: the national curriculum; pupil testing; changes to teacher training, which will allow private schools to take state trainees; a new inspectorate likely to embrace both sectors. Across the trenches, local management of state schools, plus a near-certain increase in real state school spending, are set to make the private sector's independence and privilege appear ever less exceptional. 'We are moving into a new era,' says Father Dominic Milroy. 'The whole trend is towards a mixed system: public and private working together, and parents mixing as never before.' Who knows, a few years hence it might seem quaint to publish tables comprising only schools which charge fees.  ------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-500 TOP TWELVE*  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1  King Edward's School (for boys), Birmingham 2  King Edward VI's High School for Girls, Birmingham 3  Portsmouth High School (for girls) 4  Winchester College 5  The King's School (for boys), Chester 6  The Queen's School (for boys), Chester 7  Eton College 8  St Paul's School 9  Haberdashers' Aske's School (for boys), Elstree 10  Westminster School 11  St Pauls' Girls School 12  Manchester Grammar School * for ranking formula, see supplement  ------------------------------------------------------------
19920307000000000	FT  07 MAR 92 / Low mark for some top public schools. MANY of England's famous public schools emerge well down the list of academic achievement, according to the FT-500 survey of independent schools published today. Seven of the top 12 independent schools in England and Wales are former direct-grant schools, which used to award a proportion of their places to state-funded students until the last Labour government abolished the scheme. The FT-500, one of the most comprehensive surveys of independent education in Britain yet published, ranks schools by an analysis of last year's A-level results. It also details fee levels and gives performance indicators such as the percentage of students going on to higher education. Two Birmingham schools head the list - King Edward's (for boys) and King Edward VI (for girls), closely followed by Portsmouth High. Winchester, in fourth place, is the leading public school. The survey gives a boost to day and single-sex schools. Only one school in the top 30 is co-educational - and that just in the sixth form. Only two of the top 12 are predominantly boarding. Impressive standards are achieved at the top: within the leading 20, pupils secure an average A-level grade of B. But less than a third of pupils take three A-levels on the maths and science side. Across the whole survey, average boarding fees are Pounds 8,126 a year, and day fees Pounds 4,483. Japanese 'ladies' school, Page 5 What price the old school tie now?

19921031000000000	FT  31 OCT 92 / The Financial Times Guide To Post-16 Education 18: Forest goes for growth. CAN SUCCESSFUL schools expand without jeopardising their characters? And if you want single-sex education for adolescents, but think co-ed better at sixth-form level, how can schools provide both without forcing pupils to change institution at 16? Forest School, an independent school on the Essex/London border, offers a model for dealing with both issues successfully. For Forest has expanded rapidly without losing its soul and it keeps the sexes apart at the 11 to 16 age range while integrating them in the sixth form. In barely a decade, Forest School doubled in size - expanding from 550 pupils in 1974 to 1,100 a decade later. It went co-ed in the process, but did both - grow and admit girls - with no significant increase in the size of the 'original' school. Since the mid-1980s it has grown to 1,200 on the same basis. The trick? In 1981 Forest's governors built a separate girls' school on the same campus as the existing boys' school and created a federation to unite its three schools - the third being a junior school, originally a boys' prep school, but now admitting girls into a new section. The three schools have their own classroom blocks, but share sports and specialist teaching facilities for music, computing and the like. In the senior schools, pupils are taught separately up to GCSE but together in the sixth form. A-level pupils from both schools share a sixth-form centre. The senior schools also have a boarding house with 23 boarders and room for up to 60 - 'a selling point with parents worried they might have to move away,' says David Tudor, deputy Warden. Across the three schools, the balance is 800 boys to 400 girls. One governing body covers all three. But the schools are not just separate in name: each has its own teaching staff, headteacher and distinctive ethos. A 'super-head', the Warden, presides over the three. 'We provide an appropriate teaching environment for boys and girls of different ages and enable each pupil to experience the friendless and familiarity of a small community while enjoying all the benefits which come from membership of a large school,' runs the prospectus. Warden Andrew Boggis, just appointed from an Eton housemastership, is more succinct: 'We run with nature.' Nature and the market go hand-in-hand, it seems. Mr Boggis's predecessor but one, the brains behind Forest's transformation in the late-1970s, saw a clear niche. Ilford County High for Boys and Woodford County High for Girls, the two local state grammar schools, both of which achieve results on a par with Forest's, are single sex and unable to absorb all the local demand. Of the other private schools in the area at the time, one was fully co-ed, another single-sex, and a third (Brentwood) only admitted girls into the sixth form. Brentwood has since imitated Forest and opened a girls' school on its campus for 11- to 16-year-olds, though without a separate head teacher. Apart from nature and a niche, three factors were crucial to Forest's success. First, it practised 'subsidiarity' long before the Eurocrats hijacked the concept. The three head teachers have real autonomy in managing their schools: they have their own teaching staff and premises, and far more discretion than the deputy heads of a typical 1,200-strong state school. Second, the school had enough space and resources to expand. It was not well endowed with either: the campus is 27 acres, and part of a playing field was used to build the girls school. The new school and related extensions cost Pounds 4m at today's prices, which was partly met from reserves, the rest coming from two appeals to parents. Third, the school expanded its effective catchment area at the same time as it doubled in size, to ensure that academic standards were not diluted. It did so by copying from Haberdashers' Aske's, the thriving Hertfordshire day school, the practice of mass bussing. Forest's catchment area now extends across north and east London, from Islington to Chelmsford, though the school estimates it still recruits 'somewhat more' from the vicinity than it did pre-1980. Was it worth it? Talking to pupils, the sense of belonging to the smaller unit has not been lost, and most like the balance between single-sex and co-ed. Forest also holds its own on the fees and results front. 260th in the FT-1,000, it gains average A-level results of three Cs, much the same its local independent sector competition. It stresses traditional values - John Patten would love the prospectus: 'A Shakespeare play has been performed annually since 1960' - but an easy formality reigns, and pupils are encouraged to take on extra-curricular activities. As to fees, its Pounds 4,449 a year for day pupils is the going rate locally for those opting-out of the state sector. Around 35 of each year's 150 entrants have a greater or lesser degree of financial assistance, either from the government's assisted places scheme or from school scholarships. No two schools are alike, and Forest's experience cannot be transplanted. But its achievement represents two fingers to those who think it takes bureaucrats to plan school provision.
19921024000000000	FT  24 OCT 92 / Schools for free or fee: what's the difference?: The FT-1,000 survey shows that the best of British state education is a match for many private schools. WHAT PRICE three A-levels? Between Pounds 70,000 and Pounds 140,000, if you put your child through the independent system. Nothing at all in the British state sector. At upwards of Pounds 25,000 an A-level, a private education is the most expensive asset many parents buy after their house. And the bill is rising rapidly: school fee increases have shot ahead of inflation for the last decade and they will probably continue to do so. But why pay Pounds 70,000 - the going rate for 11 years at a mid-ranking prep and independent day school  -if you can get it for nothing, bar your tax? For results, parents say in chorus. Surveys shows that more than anything, parents believe they are paying for better exam grades. Few mention for squash courts or social cachet. The private sector still includes the very best schools and remains an escape route for parents unwilling or unable to move into the neighbourhood of a good state school. Even so, The FT-1,000 survey of this summer's A-level results, to be published as a special supplement to next Saturday's FT, will, come as shock to many a mortgaged parent. For it shows that judged by results, the best of state education is easily a match for much of the independent sector. The first complete survey of exam results from both the state and independent sectors across England and Wales, the FT-1,000 shows, county by county, the top state schools in strong competition with the independent sector. That is on the basis of average A-level results, which mostly under-represent the achievement of state schools - particularly comprehensives with their non-selective intake. Pupil by pupil, much of the state sector probably does as well for individual students as its independent counterpart. True, judged by A-level results, the leading public schools are without doubt the Rolls Royce of the national system. Not a single state school or college comes in our top 50 schools and colleges: the top state school - the Judd School for Boys, Tonbridge, Kent - comes 62nd, with only three others in the top 100.* It is hardly surprising that the leading independent schools form about a third of each year's admissions to Oxbridge. The top few hundred schools are not, however, the only good schools - just, in the main, the most selective. Go further down the list, and the picture changes. Schools ranked between 250 and 350 are still the national cream: they gain average A-level results of around three grade Cs, and send most of their sixth-formers on to higher education. Of that 100, 34 are state institutions (19 grammar, 13 comprehensive and two sixth form colleges). Of the next 100 on our list, gaining average grades of CCD, 46 are in the state sector. The imbalance is still marked - but less so than you might think, given that a fifth of all sixth formers (as opposed to 7.5 per cent of the school-aged population) is in private schools. Yet beware of generalising from the top or from average results. Most parents are looking for a school close to them; and as boarding becomes ever less fashionable (boarding numbers are down 10 per cent in the last three years alone), that is increasingly true. Even boarding schools now tell you that for much of their clientele a '90 minute rule' applies - the maximum driving time a parent is prepared to endure. So for most parents, it is the county or regional market that matters. There, no single picture emerges from the FT survey. In two counties - Essex and Northumberland - the top performing school is in the state sector. In many others you can pay day fees of Pounds 5,000 a year for a school the average results of which are no better than those for nearby state schools. Unsurprisingly, grammar schools top the state sector: 25 out of the top 30 state schools are grammar schools, while the top two comprehensives - Hasmonean High in London and Wolverhampton Girls High - are, respectively, a religious foundation and a school which has opted out of local authority control. Take Kent. Of the county's top 20 schools, ten are in the state sector. Kent's leading grammar schools are a match for all but three of its independent schools. In Orpington, Tunbridge Wells, Gillingham, Sittingbourne, Gravesend and Maidstone the best-performing schools are in the state sector. The picture is more dramatic still in Buckinghamshire and Lincolnshire. Six of Buckinghamshire's grammar schools - led by Dr Challoner's, Little Chalfont - outperformed Stowe, the prestigious public school, which charges day fees of Pounds 8,200 a year. Lincolnshire has eight state schools in the top half of the FT-1,000, including two comprehensives, with the independent sector nowhere outside Stamford. Kent, Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire's state schools, which survived the national mania for forcing the state system into the comprehensive mould in the 1960s and 1970s, achieve unusually impressive results. It is no accident, perhaps, that Bucks and Lincs have among the weakest independent sectors in the country, since few, if any, grammar schools left the state sector under threat of reorganisation in the 1960s and 1970s. The survey shows that a large proportion of the highest achieving private schools are schools which, until 20 years ago, were an integral part of the state sector. Significantly, many comprehensives with professional middle-class catchment areas score almost as highly as the leading grammar schools. Oxfordshire's top state school is Cherwell, a comprehensive serving don-infested North Oxford; Avon's is Chew Valley, in Chew Magna, mid-way between Bath and Bristol; Bishop Luffa in Chichester heads the list in West Sussex; and so on. County by county, state institutions in the wealthiest areas, with professional clienteles, gain the best results, whatever their formal status. Indeed, an FT survey of Bristol schools, included in next week's supplement, surmises that the city's independent day schools may well be more socially representative than the highest achieving state schools in the city, most of which are in its affluent suburbs or commuter belt. In the state sector, then, education by mortgage has to a large extent replaced education by ability. The relationship between schools' performance and house prices is marked. All of the ten top performing counties in our survey have higher than average house prices. Within cities and towns, estate agents will tell you that houses in the catchment areas of high-performing state schools go for a premium. According to Jason Lamb, of Douglas Maloney, an agent for the catchment area of Cranbrook School, a state grammar in Kent: 'It is very important that houses are in the catchment area. Frequently it is the first thing that people mention.' By contrast, our survey shows that the level of fees charged by independent schools has little bearing on academic performance. Fee levels generally have more to do with the wealth of an institution's endowment, or the grandeur of its recent building projects, than the quality of its teaching. Collectively, private schools in Leicestershire, Greater Manchester and Greater London have the best A-level results in the country, yet day fees are typically below average in all three counties. Next week's supplement includes value-for-money tables. Recent surveys have attempted to assess the relative 'value' schools add to their pupils by comparing grades achieved at A-level with those achieved at GCSE. This measure is of only limited - if any - significance, since it ignores progress made by pupils in their first five years at a school. It also fails to take into account a school's sixth-form admissions policy - how many of the weaker pupils get weeded out at age 16. Next week's FT-1,000 is the first survey to publish institutions' stay-on rates. It reveals wide variations, even among top schools. While at St Paul's Girls' London all fifth formers stayed on last year, 85 per cent did so at Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls, Elstree. Several independent schools in the top 100 had stay-on rates of less than 60 per cent - lower than many comprehensives with a wider academic mix. Stay-on rates are not just a reflection of the capacity of pupils, but they make for revealing comparisons between schools. Last year's FT survey of the independent sector showed single-sex schools leading the field. Next week's FT-1,000 reveals the same pattern in the state sector. Of the top 30 state schools, 25 are single-sex - most of them grammar schools. The survey finds some excellent co-educational schools, but overall the results of mixed-sex schools are disappointing even among grammar schools. Why are single-sex schools so comparatively strong? Any explanation, however tentative, is bound to be controversial. But in the state sector, one thing is clear: successful single-sex schools are among those which have best defended their character against external attempts by politicians and bureaucrats to reform them. It is time, perhaps, that British educationists paid more attention to the pioneering work by US scholars John Chubb and Terry Moe** on the deleterious impact of state bureaucracy on the achievement of schools. There is more to schools than results. There is also more to results than A-levels: vocational courses suit many post-16 pupils far better than a narrow academic regime, and Further Education Colleges are pioneering new courses alongside more traditional avenues. Yet high-performing institutions almost invariably make exam results a priority. Strong exam performance generally also goes with a strong extra-curricular side and intense efforts for those at the lower ability end. In a recent survey to find out why parents chose it, Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, an independent day school in Bristol, found academic results to be by far the most important factor. Next, in order, came its small size, its happy atmosphere, the headmaster and discipline. 'There's no point trying to re-invent the wheel,' says Dr Richard Gliddon, its headmaster. 'Results are the most significant aspect of achievement.' * Precise figures are subject to slight revision for late information. ** John Chubb and Terry Moe, Politics, Markets and America's Schools, Brookings.
19930828000000000	FT  28 AUG 93 / Independent schools - FT 500: A premier league starts to emerge - John Authers considers the latest A-level results and finds an unmistakable trend. HEAD TEACHERS are always quick to assert that A-level league tables do not tell the whole story about a school's performance, and they are, of course, right. However, the story they do tell is growing increasingly clear. For most independent schools, the FT now has data for the last six years. The tables on this page and the next show the rankings for each of 501 independent schools both for this year, and, where the figures are available, the average position for the previous five. There is a marked and unmistakable trend at the top. Of this year's top ten, all bar two were in the top ten averages for the previous five years. The only newcomers were Withington Girls School in Manchester, ninth with a previous a average of 18th, and King's College School, London, which came tenth after a previous five-year average of 21st place. The two to drop out of the top ten scarcely suffered serious falls from grace, with Haberdashers' Aske's, Borehamwood, now 12th, and Wycombe Abbey 16th. Close though the margins between different schools' results can often be, the league tabling has revealed a hard core of consistent performers - a 'Carling Premiership' of schools as one educationalist has put it. A closer look at the schools which made it into the premier league does however cast some question over whether the exercise is measuring the quality of a school's tuition, or just its success in attracting able pupils. The top ten this year include two internationally renowned and highly prestigious boys' boarding schools, Eton and Winchester, for both of which applications will always be high. The remaining eight are predominantly day schools, based in large conurbations, and therefore have a catchment area which enables them to select from a broad range of pupils. Deciding between mixed and single-sex education involves more than academic criteria. But these results also seem to provide an academic argument for single-sex education - all bar one school in the top thirty are single-sex up to the age of 16, using the FT's definition of single-sex schools (see footnotes to our top thirty table). Leicester Grammar School is the highest-placed fully coeducational school at 29th, although Westminster has a mixed sixth form. John Trevis, schools consultant with the Gabbitas, the London-based educational consultancy, further points out that the few boarding schools among the top academic performers are unusual in that they have special houses for scholars, where the ablest pupils can feed off each other. This calls into question the concept of 'value for money'. Schools such as St Paul's in London, top of the tree this year, may have excellent results, but it may not necessarily follow that they offer better value for money. It could be argued that pupils bright enough to prosper at St Paul's would also shine anywhere else. Further, the standards required by the academic elite schools are so great that it could be argued that many parents should ignore them in any case. Stephen Baldock, highmaster of St Paul's, admits that his school is working on 'good material'. However, he points out that this year's results included good grades for some of the boys who were not naturally among the most gifted. Trevis suggests that parents with children who are lacking in academic self-confidence might deliberately avoid the top schools because the pace of lessons may be too much for them. Schools lower in the standings may be much better equipped to cater for their needs. He points, for example, to Stanbridge Earls School, in Hampshire, which finished 501st. The school specialises in teaching dyslexics and children with other learning difficulties, and, according to Trevis, ranks as highly as St Paul's in the job it does for its pupils. Another issue is the effect the league tables will themselves have on schools' performance. The government's motive in publishing them is to reveal under-achievement and give the schools a powerful incentive to improve standards. The 2.2 per cent overall improvement in pass rates by the independent schools surveys suggest that the tables may have had this effect. The objection to the league table concept that individual positions are too strongly influenced by minor fluctuations in results seems unfair. Compare this year's score with the average for the previous five, and you will find a remarkable degree of consistency. While this is most evident at the top, significant deviations are still rare lower down. A few significant jumps were recorded - for example Croydon High School came 32nd, compared with a five-year rank of 103, and Francis Holland school, in Clarence Gate, near Regent's Park, London, leapt to 50th following an average placing of 229. Further down in the tables, Cobham Hall School, near Gravesend, Kent, rose to 194th from a previous average of 409th. Consistency in league tables has been helped by the rigorous approach taken by the FT's statisticians, using data supplied by the Independent Schools Information Service. These tables are based on total UCCA points, which include both A-levels, and the new AS-levels ('Advanced Supplementary') which were introduced to add breadth to sixth form curriculums, and are intended to be as difficult as A-levels, but with syllabuses only half the size. By taking this approach, all grades achieved, not just As and Bs, are taken into account, giving a full picture of a school's academic strength. Schools which provide extra options such as AS levels will be credited. General studies A-levels, offered by many schools as an extra option but often without any devoted tuition, has been derided by employers' organisations. It is usually ignored by university admissions tutors, and so it has been excluded from all the FT's calculations. Schools with less than ten candidates in total have also been excluded, as these are likely to be highly specialist, while the grades achieved could lead to statistical distortions - as was shown by last year's government league tables for state schools which saw the tiny Scilly Isles in first place. The FT has also aimed to avoid over-simplification by ranking schools using two separate scores - UCCA points per entry, and UCCA points per pupil. The former gives the average grade in each exam taken, while the latter gives the total grades each pupil has on average accumulated. Either could be argued to be preferable. The former can be manipulated by deliberately withdrawing pupils from A-levels where they do not seem likely to do well, while the latter rewards schools where pupils commonly take on more than the standard three subjects. League tables compiled using the two measures would be different, as a glance down the columns headed UCCA points per entry and UCCA points per pupil show. Instead the two have been combined to give the ranking score. As the bald ranking can unfairly accentuate what are often marginal differences between schools' results, the figure in the second column gives an 'FT score' which shows by how much a school has varied from the norm. This is calculated so that an average school will score exactly 1.00. This was achieved by the schools ranked from 263 to 269, and is equivalent to roughly 18 UCCA points, or three Cs per pupil. A more profound problem is whether A-level grades themselves are the true 'gold standard' of educational excellence which many teachers and university admissions tutors assume. Difficulties with university entrance this year, and wide discrepancies in the grades awarded by different A-level examining boards, have brought serious questioning of the A-level system for the first time. In Scotland, most schools prefer to do the broader Scottish 'Highers' rather than A-levels - which is why only two Scottish schools appear in the table. Further education colleges in the state system have reported significant increases in demand for new 'vocational A-levels', in which some exams will be replaced by work experience and coursework. In the independent sector, International Baccalaureate is also gaining in popularity. Sevenoaks School, in Kent, has been in the forefront of introducing the IB, which forces pupils to do a broader range of subjects, and has wider international recognition. Richard Barker, Sevenoaks' headmaster, believes that the IB allows greater diversity, and the abler pupils are encouraged to take it. IB candidates account for the majority of the school's Oxbridge entrants this year. The school's figures in the table have been derived using a complicated formula to convert IB results into an A-level UCCA points equivalent.
19931030000000000	FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (4): Do grades suffer when girl meets boy?. 'YOU WOULD think in these days that girls could perform as well in a classroom where there are boys as in a classroom where there are none. I don't know why that is not the case, but it's unfortunate.' A statement like that, coming from a sixth-former at the girls-only North London Collegiate, cannot go unchallenged. Other sixth-formers, dressed casually as the school rules permit, take issue: 'I don't think it's unfortunate. Once you are out of school it's almost inevitable that the society you are going to be in will be mixed. It's a question of taking the opportunity to be single sex.' 'School is for learning. You have got to have fun but I wouldn't want to go to a school which was mixed. I think it would be a distraction.' Now the protagonist is put on to the defensive. She suggests that a mixed school is a more natural environment. But the enthusiasm the sixth-formers feel for single-sex education is strong. 'It's very cosy. Girls can support each other. You don't have to play the changes in the sexes off each other. I think it's important to have the opportunity to make close friendships with just girls.' Then one makes a point which many academics have already noticed. 'Boys start to mature at 17 or 18. A 16-year-old boy can be the most painful person in the entire world.' League tables of performance in GCSE exams, usually taken when the candidates are 16, bear this out. Girls' schools dominate the first 30 places, to an extent which suggests that girls at that age must be academically superior to boys. But that does not prove anything about the relative merits of single-sex and mixed education. If girls at that age are academically more able than boys, it might still be possible to make the advantage tell at mixed schools as much as at girls' schools. However, it is difficult to see many ways in which North London Collegiate girls are missing out. The school, set in a broad campus at the edge of Canons Park in North London, overtook its more famous rival, St Paul's Girls' School in Hammersmith, to become the nation's top girls' school this year. Established by Miss Frances Mary Buss in 1850 to educate the girls of north London, it has a less exclusive air than most independent schools. Scholarships and assisted places are used to recruit as widely as possible from the local community, and the girls include strong contingents of both blacks and Asians. This is very much part of the school's mission. While Cheltenham Ladies' College was meant to train young ladies, North London Collegiate is 'for girls' who intend to make their own way in the world. Symbolically, the school no longer even offers cookery. Instead, the cookery room has been converted and is now full of girls enthusiastically working at craft, design and technology. North London Collegiate also prepares its pupils for the hard-headed commercial world outside via the Young Enterprise scheme, which gives 'companies' of youngsters starter capital of around Pounds 1,000 and then gives them a year to make profits. Whether girls truly feel freer to tackle the allegedly 'masculine' science subjects in an all-female environment is more open to question. Mathematics was the school's most successful A-level subject this year, with 31 of the 39 candidates winning A grades. But the most popular subject is the female bastion of French (45 candidates, including 24 As), while Chemistry attracted only 25 (14 As) and Physics 14 (8 As). Elsewhere, the music centre is well-appointed and well used, while the school puts on numerous drama productions, some in conjunction with Harrow, the rather more exclusive boys' school just up the road.
19931030000000000	FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (5): New kid on the block. LEICESTER Grammar provides a potent riposte to plenty of preconceptions about schools. It is fast gathering fresh claims to fame. The newest recruit to the prestigious Headmasters' Conference, having been inducted earlier this year, it is also the top coeducational school in the FT-1,000. But most remarkably, Leicester Grammar opened as recently as 1981. The centuries of tradition and wealthy endowments boasted by most schools above it in the tables, and many below it, might be expensive luxuries. Leicester Grammar started in response to public demand following the abolition of the city's state grammar schools. As the history of the school's first 10 years proclaims, the Grammar is 'a product of the enterprise culture of the 1980s'. A group of worthies clubbed together to take over the buildings of one of the old grammar schools when it was closed by the council. Its fees still put it high in the value-for-money league tables, and it has expanded rapidly - from 94 pupils on opening day in 1981 to 565 now. The only problem is overcrowding. Ingenuity has allowed the school to reclaim every nook and cranny in the buildings it has inherited. Music rooms are in the cellar, while a fully-equipped multigym lurks in what used to be a broom cupboard. Leicester cathedral, next to the school buildings, is used for religious assemblies, while the school's impressive hall is also used for drama rehearsals. Lack of resources has not dented formidable extracurricular ambitions. The school runs its own glossy magazine and the school choir has even released a record. Coeducation was never an issue, according to John Sugden, the headmaster. At its foundation, the school needed as many pupils as possible and cutting out boys or girls was ruled out on purely commercial grounds. He backs mixed schools on educational grounds as well: 'If you put the two sexes together you are bound, if you get the balance right, to get a better education. Otherwise you are cutting out half the human race.' The pupils, dressed in adult business clothes rather than uniform at sixth-form level and including many members of Leicester's east African Asian community, certainly seem happy with coeducation - to judge by the necking couples to be found in the sixth form's attic-like common room, which is off-limits to staff . . .
19931030000000000	FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (1): State schools close in on the top dogs - The results of the FT's unique survey. INDEPENDENT schools dominate the top of this year's FT survey of 1,000 schools, holding 92 of the first 100 positions. But the challenge from the state sector is gathering momentum. In last year's FT-1000 only three state schools earned a place in the top 200. This year the figure is 23. Last year the top state school was ranked 63rd, but this year's top state school, Colchester County Girls High in Essex, is ranked 37th. So while there is reassurance for fee-paying parents who, on average, pay Pounds 36,200 for one child's secondary education at a private day school, or Pounds 65,800 at a boarding school, in some areas the state sector offers an alternative which cannot be ignored. Essex is blessed with two other high-flying state grammar schools, Chelmsford County High (78) and King Edward VI (81), both of which outshine the county's best independent schools. Buckinghamshire, which also retained grammar schools in several areas, and Kent also have excellent state school records. Placing schools as precisely as this is a difficult and controversial job, which the FT has done as fairly as possible. The FT - 1,000 is the result of six months' research. Questionnaires were sent to the 1,100 top performing state schools according to last year's government statistics. These represent one third of state schools teaching A-levels. In addition, the Independent Schools' Information Service (ISIS) supplied compatible data on over 500 (the majority) of its members. Before the tables were completed, head teachers were sent checking sheets to enable them to verify their entry and amend A-level grades where necessary. All schools with at least 10 A-level candidates are included in our table. As most parents choose a school within 10 miles of home, they are listed alphabetically within counties, to show local choices at a glance. Unlike league tables that assess schools only on the performance of their best pupils by ranking them according to the percentage of A and B grades, the FT-1000 compares the results of all A-level candidates using the points system of the Universities Central Council of Admissions (UCCA). The FT-1000 rank positions represent a weighting of the average number of UCCA points achieved per pupil (the quantity of grades attained) with the average number of UCCA points per subject entry (the quality of grades attained). However, rank positions can exaggerate differences between schools, particularly between middle ranking schools. Although there are marked disparities between schools at the top and bottom ends of the league table, schools ranked between 280 and 630 all achieved results within 10 per cent of the average - equivalent to each pupil achieving three grade Cs. For this reason, the FT score is an important corrective to rankings. It has been scaled so that a score of 1.00 represents the average performance of all the schools in the FT-1000. The table opposite enables you to convert FT scores into average A-level grades attained. It is not surprising that grammar schools, often more selective than competing independents, lead the state sector. For example, 17 Kent grammar schools achieved an FT score greater than 1.00, equivalent to average A-level grades of between BBC and CCC. Yet in spite of their wide ability intake, many comprehensives achieved impressive results. Three took places in our top 200 - Hasmonean High in Hendon (ranked 73rd), Dame Alice Owen's School in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire (ranked 131), and Cherwell in Oxford (ranked 185). Of the 315 included in the FT-1000, 135 came within 10 per cent of the average FT score - the equivalent of at least three grade Cs per pupil. Overall, opted-out comprehensives achieved similar results to local authority comprehensives. But for grammar schools, opted-out schools out-scored those staying with the local authority with average FT scores of 1.05 against 0.99. This may for the moment reflect the fact that successful schools are more likely to take the risk of opting out, but this trend must be monitored carefully. Parents keen on independent day schools can be cheered by the fact that 78 out of the top 100 charge annual fees below the average of Pounds 5,170. Those contemplating boarding schools are less fortunate. With a few exceptions, the FT-1000 reveals that you have to pay a premium for exceptional results. Eighty five out of the top 100 independent boarding schools charge above average fees (Pounds 9,400 a year). Nor are academic returns so rewarding. Although two of the most prestigious  -Winchester and Eton - remain anchored in the top 10, boarding school pupils achieved less impressive results than those at independent day schools, achieving average FT scores of 1.04, rather than 1.08. This means that Winchester, Eton and the girls' school Wycombe Abbey manage to appear in the top 10 of the FT's rough and ready value-for money tables (see page 4), in spite of high annual fees of Pounds 12,270, Pounds 11,934 and Pounds 11,538. The boarding schools' problem could stem from the 6 per cent fall in rolls which they suffered last year. As a result of the recession, boarding schools now receive fewer applicants and must be less selective. State schools with boarding facilities should not be overlooked. Several achieve impressive results, including the Royal Grammar, High Wycombe (66th), Reading (177th) and the Royal Grammar, Lancaster (189th). Fees average Pounds 4,000. They can be identified by the Boarding % column in our main table. Comparisons of A-level results around the country with average house prices make startling reading. With the exception of Greater London and Oxfordshire, the 10 best performing counties have below average house prices. In Leicestershire, fourth in the country, the average house price is Pounds 49,250 - 22 per cent lower than the national average. Fees for Leicestershire independent schools are also slightly below average. Single-sex schools achieved better results than fully mixed schools in both the state and independent sectors. The FT scores for single sex schools are identical for boys and girls (1.09 in independents and 1.04 in grammar schools), whereas mixed independent schools averaged 1.01, with grammar schools on 0.95. The strong showing for single-sex schools still leaves plenty of room for controversy. None of the top 20 schools is mixed throughout its age range, and the recent decision by a mixed state school in Essex to segregate boys and girls for classes shows that the idea is gaining in favour. However, these figures demonstrate only the academic impact of single-sex status and say nothing about the broader effects on a child's upbringing. John Sugden, head of Leicester Grammar, the top co-educational school at number 29 in the rankings, says the strength of single-sex schools is a historical coincidence. He points out that that most well-off selective city schools happen to be single-sex. Leicester Grammar is already approaching the very best results in spite of being co-educational because it is selective. Boys' school heads tend to agree. Girls' schools, however, take a different approach, and plainly believe that single-sex education is vital for their pupils. Joan Clanchy, headmistress of North London Collegiate, is not given to understatement: 'Girls are actually cleverer than boys. So if you have got a school full of girls, you will do better.' In other words, the figures may just say something about the relative development of the two sexes. Research suggests that at the age of 16 girls are more mature and intellectually advanced than boys. The issue is less clear at A-level where the boy's half of 'twin' schools such as Haberdashers' Aske's, Elstree, St Paul's, and King Edward's, Birmingham, tend to do slightly better. The strongest criticism of school league tables is that no allowance is made for schools' selection policies at age 11 or 13. Nor do they take into account socio-economic variations in catchment areas. Ian Mellor of Sir Roger Manwood's grammar school in Sandwich, Kent (ranked 330) speaks for many: 'The hoary old argument that it is easier for a suburban grammar school to produce results of a high order than it is for a school in a deprived city area is so obvious as to make comparison between the two types futile. Even grammar schools cannot readily be compared, since they have different catchments. My area takes about the top 25 per cent of applicants, whereas others take anything from 10 to 40 per cent.' Sceptics can further point to the catchment areas of the top comprehensives  -for example Hasmonean High serves the Jewish community of North London, and Cherwell is in North Oxford, home to most of the university's dons. Schools with a selective sixth form also have an advantage, as the deputy head of St Martin's comprehensive in Brentwood (640th) said: 'We have a policy of entering all pupils with a chance of passing, however slim. We could produce impressive statistics by changing this policy to the detriment of our students.' Alex Clarke, head of Poole Grammar, Dorset, also made the point that A-level results do not always reflect the achievements of a school's original intake: 'Although we are a selective school at 12-plus, about 40 per cent of our A-level candidates join us at 16-plus where our entry requirements for A-level are similar to most schools.' These problems explain why the government is looking for ways of measuring 'value added', or the extent to which pupils improve while they are at a school, rather than printing raw exam results. This year, as last, the FT-1000 has excluded general studies A-level in its calculations. Roger Dancey, headteacher of King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys in Birmingham (ranked 103) was one of many who insisted on its value: '50,000 Joint Matriculation Board candidates should not be ignored. General studies is an excellent predictor for higher education.' But the weight of educational opinion is against them. Earlier this year the Engineering Council published a report written by Alan Smithers, professor of education at Manchester university, which said that general studies counted for little in the competition for university places and had failed to broaden the curriculum. Some pupils even revised for it by playing the board game Trivial Pursuit. Other heads lamented the omission of a five year FT score - a feature of last year's survey - pointing out that A-level results can vary considerably from year to year, especially for schools with small sixth forms. Unfortunately, so many state schools were unwilling or unable to produce the information last year that the five-year comparisons had to be abandoned this year. Nor do A-level league tables reflect the achievements of sixth-formers who combine one or two A-levels with vocational courses, which are fast gaining popularity with employers. Many excellent schools offer superb sixth form vocational courses but will never excel in A-level league tables. Other heads who may justifiably feel hard done by are those who run the schools which entered fewer than 10 candidates for A-levels. Results for these schools can be so volatile that it could be misleading to publish rank orderings which include them, but some produced impressive results this year. In spite of these objections, all of which must be taken into account, these tables still help parents to shortlist schools that might suit their child's academic aptitude. And for all their protestations, schools cannot deny that the tables have an impact. Early in the morning of August 28 this year, the head of a boarding school in Surrey was woken by one of his governors. A copy of the FT guide to independent school A-level results was thrust into his hands. The governor, chairman of the finance committee, had been awaiting the new league tables with trepidation. The school was higher up in the tables, but not by as much as had been hoped, and the head had to do something about it. The head of the school in question has spent the last year attempting to raise academic standards. While parents continue to want to read league tables, he will continue to respond to them. If that means attempting to improve academic standards, then the FT league table has achieved something.

19931030000000000	FT  30 OCT 93 / State schools begin to gain on private sector: . . . But fee-payers dominate the league tables. John Authers and Gillian de Bono study the FT schools survey. BRITAIN'S state schools have been gaining academic ground against the fee paying sector, according to this year's FT-1000 survey of Advanced Level examination results published with the Weekend FT today. Although private schools still dominate the upper reaches of our league table, 23 state schools made it into the top 200, compared with only three last year. More significantly, some famous and expensive independent schools failed to achieve A-level scores as good as those of the top state schools. Essex girls at Colchester County Girls' High, the top state school at no 37, showed a clean pair of heels to those of Benenden, Cheltenham Ladies' College, and Roedean. Lower down the list, John Hamden grammar school in High Wycombe in 411th place, still beat respected boarding schools such as Blundell's and Sedbergh. This year's survey has also raised controversial questions about what type of school is most likely to get the best results. It suggests that, with impressive exceptions, day schools do better than traditional boarding schools and that single sex schools do better than co-educational schools. But one of the most striking revelations from the publication of exam results is the success - in one area at least - of the despised selective system, based on grammar and secondary modern schools. While most of the country was converting these '11-plus' schools into comprehensives, particularly under Margaret Thatcher when she was education secretary in the early 1970s, Buckinghamshire retained selection at aged 12. Now it boasts not only the top state boys' school in the FT-1000 survey, but average results well ahead of those for the country as a whole. Last year's government figures put the county's A level performance in fifth place out of 108 education authorities. Our survey suggests it has done even better this year. But was good performance by the cleverest children achieved at the expense of the less fortunate - those who used to be stigmatised as '11-plus failures'? It seems not. Buckingham gets excellent results from pupils with a wide range of abilities, including those who fail the grammar school exam. In High Wycombe, for example, The Royal Grammar School (66th in the FT-1000), was up with famous names in the independent sector, such as Dulwich College, Charterhouse, Shrewsbury, and Haileybury. Last year it gained more places at Oxford and Cambridge than any other state school. However, the town boasts two other successful grammar schools and, more remarkably, several secondary moderns (now called 'upper schools') with good examination results. Because our league table is based only on A-levels, it does not show the upper schools' success. But in GCSE exams, taken at 16, some of these schools finished ahead of comprehensives in neighbouring Milton Keynes. So the latest evidence from the FT-1000 and the government's exam statistics suggest that the selective education system which Britain has been dismantling during the last 25 years can be successful for a wide range of ability - under certain conditions. The figures for Buckinghamshire also illustrate a more general truth - that where state schools achieve good results, the independent sector tends to be pushed into second place. It might be objected that High Wycombe, like some other places with good state school results, is inhabited by the ambitious middle classes whose children would do well in any system. Our survey shows, for example, that the best performing comprehensive schools are those which serve areas where affluent and educated people live, such as north Oxford, or Sunningdale in Berkshire. In Buckinghamshire, Andrew MacTavish, head of John Hampden, confirms that many parents who work for international companies have moved to the Wycombe area on the advice of their employers. Wycombe, situated in the leafy Bucks commuter belt, is indeed attractive to prosperous parents. But it is not wealthy enough to explain such outstanding results. Unemployment has followed the decline of the town's traditional furniture industry, and a strong influx of immigrants means that it is not without 'inner-city' problems. The good rating of Wycombe's grammar schools in the FT-1000 no doubt reflects the fact that parents send their children from a wide radius, including the far corners of Berkshire and Surrey. Weak competition from local independent schools also helps. It seems that in this area, the dream of many idealists of the 1950s and 1960s has been fulfilled: they hoped then that strong middle class demand for improved state education would make private schools unnecessary. But the middle classes always want the best for their children, which in a selective system, means grammar schooling, good A level grades and a university degree. What happens to the others? In High Wycombe the answer might be that they go to the Sir William Ramsay upper school. In that case their prospects would be quite good. Last year 34 per cent of the school's GCSE exam entries resulted grades A to C, equivalent to a pass in the old GCE O-level. This was close to the average for the whole of the UK and much better than the performance of Milton Keynes's comprehensives, which accept children with a much wider range of abilities. There, the average is only 23 per cent. Two other upper schools in Wycombe, St Bernard's, which is Roman Catholic, and Wye Valley, also managed to better the nearby comprehensives. If the entire Wycombe area is viewed as one big comprehensive school, to use an analogy suggested by Bill Richards, head of Sir William Ramsay, then in 1992, 52 per cent of pupils win at least five GCSEs at grades A to C. The average for the whole of the UK last year was 38 per cent. Sir William Ramsay has even started a sixth form, once an unimagined development for a school intended only to take the 70 per cent of pupils who did not make the grade at the age of 12. Although such successes might encourage those Conservatives who want to return to some form of selective education system, recent attempts in several counties to reintroduce selection, have run into fierce local opposition. In Wycombe, however, there is equally fierce local commitment to selection. Heads of the area's 13 schools agree this stems from the council's battle in the mid 1970s with Shirley Williams, then Labour education secretary, to preserve the grammar schools. Ever since that successful rearguard action, the Conservative county council has wanted to prove that its system works and can win popular support. In Buckinghamshire, a Conservative vote is a vote for selective education. It was the only county in England to retain a Conservative council after the May elections this year. As Richards points out, this popular support could not have been won only on the basis of A level results by grammar schools. If parents believed that exam grades were achieved at the expense of sub-standard education for the rest, there would have been strong pressure to change the system. So it is instructive to look behind the examination results, at the strategies which the education authority has used to fulfil the ideals, as it saw them, of the 1944 Education Act. This envisaged a harmonious relationship between three types of schools, grammar, secondary modern and technical based on selection. First, the authority has promoted a traditional ethos in all its schools. In Wycombe, all schools enforce uniform and discipline strictly. Second, it has formed a sixth-form consortium of Wycombe schools which allows pupils of one school to take lessons at another. This emphasises to pupils who miss the grammar school boat that they have a second chance. The idea is that each school should play to its strengths. Grammar schools offer academic A-levels, while upper schools such as Cressex and Sir William Ramsay have introduced new vocational qualifications, intended to persuade less academically able 16-year-olds to stay in education. Upper school pupils are now more likely to take A-levels, as they can do so without the disruption of moving to a new school. Third, co-operation has been encouraged below the sixth form, to give children who under-perform at 12 a second chance. Late developers can be transferred to the grammar school. Thus, many children who fail their 12-plus exam, win good A level grades in the grammar school. Fourth, the authority administers the applications and entries for all schools in the area, even including the Royal Grammar which has opted out of the authority for financial reasons. This reduces wasteful competition for ther best pupils and makes forward planning easier. Fifth, in Wycombe, the authority has kept the traditional division between the sexes in its grammar schools, in spite of the shift to co-education elsewhere, even in the top independent boarding schools. Does this segregation help to explain the area's good results? Certainly our survey shows that, on average, single sex schools get better examination grades in both state and independent sectors. But there is much debate about the significance of this result. Do boys and girls really learn better without the distraction of the opposite sex? Or is it merely an historical accident that schools with an established record of academic success tend to have remained single sex? Muriel Pilkington, head of Wycombe High, champions the traditional view that girls can flourish better in classrooms without boys, who, she says, tend to be less mature. If girls want to meet boys, they can do so after class, since Wycombe High and John Hampden face each other across a road. Nevertheless, many parents dislike segregation by sex, as the shift to co-education in other parts of the country amply attests. And this is only one reason to be cautious about Buckinghamshire's laboratory of 'traditional' education, despite the achievements. However enlightened and flexible the system may claim to be, dividing young children by academic 'success' and 'failure' can be cruel. In Buckinghamshire, these words were formerly used in letters sent by the authority to the parents of every 12-year-old. At Sir William Ramsay, pupils appear happy, well-disciplined, and by no means the dejected or embittered failures which mythology might suggest. Five out of six prefects say they want to go to university, an ambition which seems quite realistic. Meanwhile, the school's cricket captain says: 'We were rained off last summer, but we'll beat the Royal Grammar this year. Just you wait and see.' And yet, and yet . . . in spite of all this optimism and fighting talk, pupils and teachers attest to intense pressure on children to 'succeed' by winning a place at grammar school. One of the prefects at Sir William Ramsay who is aiming for university, unwittingly summed up the argument, which will always remain against selection: 'Of course if I was good enough, I would go to RGS. But I wasn't good enough.'
19931117000000000	FT  17 NOV 93 / When raw results are not enough: Dearing leads quest for added value; Boys catch up with girls after 16. WHY DO some schools perform better than others? 'Raw' examination results in themselves are not enough to show how well a school is performing. Sir Ron Dearing, who heads the quango in charge of the national curriculum and testing, has been asked to examine methods of measuring 'value added' - the extent to which pupils have improved when they leave a school, compared with when they started. All the experimental 'value-added' projects so far carried out show much more narrow differences between school performance than the 'raw' league tables. Some schools also shift position substantially. But all reveal that a school's management and teaching can significantly affect its standing. Several factors determine performance in the main league tables: Selectivity Grammar schools, whose pupils have had to pass an exam at the age of 11 or 12 to gain entrance, ought to perform better in league tables than comprehensives - otherwise the 11-plus exams would have been disastrous. Some comprehensive school catchment areas also tend to have more academically able children than others - for example, Cherwell school in north Oxford, a top performer at A-level, teaches the children of many university lecturers. Gender This is controversial, but girls develop at a different rate from boys, and educational evidence suggests that they are more intellectually mature at the age of 16, when GCSEs are taken. Boys then catch up, and the differences between the genders is much less marked at the point when A-levels are taken. This year 55 per cent of girls' school pupils passed five GCSEs at O-level grades, compared with only 48 per cent of boys at boys' schools. A study of London schools by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities found that girls scored 2.6 more GCSE points on average than boys - equivalent to a C rather than an F in one exam. Family backgrounds and social conditions As the table on the opposite page shows, the correlation between social deprivation and academic performance at the level of local education authorities is so close that the problem of academic underperformance might almost be labelled a social one. School management This is variable which schools can do most about. And it makes a difference. Professor John Howson, professor of education at Oxford Brookes University, pointed to the sometimes marked disparity between boys' and girls' grammar schools at A-level, when gender is a negligible issue. Their social catchment areas are identical and selection is determined for them by local authorities. Most such schools perform similarly. But this year's government survey shows repeated differences - for example in Tunbridge Wells, Kent the girls' grammar averaged 18.2 A-level points this year (20.1 last year), compared with 12.4 at the boys' grammar (13.1 last year). In Bournemouth, Dorset, however, the boys' school averaged 22 points compared with 15.4 at the girls' school. Dr Howson said these disparities could be explained only by differences in the schools' management. He said: 'It doesn't matter whether a school's management is very democratic, or quite autocratic, as long as everyone is working together.'

19940912000000000	FT  12 SEP 94 / People: The head who saw off Patten - As schools return for a new academic year, Joan Clanchy tells John Authers that, while she regards league tables as 'good clean fun', she drew the line at controversial English tests for 14-year-olds. Joan Clanchy, headmistress of the North London Collegiate School, has had fame thrust upon her in the past two years. She can lay the blame at the the feet of the government and its spasm of education reforms. Until two years ago, she and her school almost seemed to be going out of fashion. A tall Oxford-educated Scot, she took over as head of North London nine years ago having previously been head of St George's School, Edinburgh  -another traditional girls' school. A keen academic historian, Clanchy was then best known only as one of the most imposing figures in a girls' school movement increasingly threatened by the decision of some boys' schools to go mixed, and as a pragmatic educational traditionalist. With this reputation in mind, ministers appointed her to the National Curriculum Council, the quango which administered the new curriculum it was imposing in all the state schools of England and Wales. Now, Clanchy starts a new school year as head of a school still bathing in positive publicity, thanks to its mighty showing in exam result league tables; it was top of the FT's table for girls' schools last year and this. Meanwhile, the new education secretary, Gillian Shephard, has introduced a radically reformed package of tests following a revolt by the teaching profession in which Clanchy was seen to take a leading part. It accounted for the political head of Shephard's predecessor, John Patten. Ironically, Clanchy disapproves of the league tables which have showed her school to perform prodigiously. Like most teachers, her first concern is for individual pupils, and she is alarmed by the distraught reactions from girls who managed 'only' a B in their GCSE exams - league tables now reveal that 81.5 per cent of the GCSEs taken at North London Collegiate last term resulted in A-grades. Unlike many independent school headmistresses, she has experience of the state sector, having started her teaching career at a comprehensive, and is quick to admit that North London is very privileged. Set in beautiful buildings on the edge of an Edgware park, the school is heavily over-subscribed, and she therefore has the luxury of being able to select pupils, interviewing parents as well as their daughters. She also treats the welter of positive publicity for girls' schools which the tables have triggered with amusement: 'League tables,' she says, 'are good, clean fun, but they don't necessarily show that girls' schools are particularly wonderful. What they might show is that 16-year-old girls work a lot harder than boys.' The truly interesting phenomenon, for her, is girls' previous under-performance, not their more recent improvement. She points out that girls now out-perform boys by a wide margin at GCSE at both single-sex and mixed schools, a disparity which is widening every year. She believes this is a social circumstance: 'Girls, particularly those of middle-ranking academic ability, now believe that they have a real chance of entering a career with their academic qualifications, and so they are working for them.' And she attributes this to girls' 'constant lack of confidence'. On this reading, the case for single-sex education does not rest on league tables. Instead: 'The big argument for single-sex education is that you don't have to conform to gender stereotypes. That's not just in science and maths but in behaviour generally.' North London Collegiate conforms to enough stereotypes to show that it has not lost touch with its traditions. Girls wear uniform until the sixth form, when most of them choose to dress smartly in any case. Many play hockey. Standards of discipline seem high enough to satisfy any parent, and the girls treat teachers - particularly Clanchy herself, just turned 55 and a dominant figure standing around six feet tall - with obvious respect. But it has shed enough stereotypes to move with the times. The student body is almost as ethnically mixed as its neighbours in the state sector, partly thanks to the government's assisted places scheme for children from low-income families. Cooking has been dropped in favour of craft, design and technology. Girls are offered the chance to run their own companies as part of the Young Enterprise scheme - 'selling each other junk' as Clanchy cheerfully describes it - and this year's most popular A-level subject was maths. Most North London Collegiate girls seem boisterously self-confident, and obviously expect to take on a challenging career when they graduate. Thus the school's role under Clanchy is, if anything, to challenge stereotypes. One of these is that maths and sciences are a male preserve, and Clanchy points out: 'It used to be that Latin and Greek were the ultimate measure of cleverness. Now that women do much better than men at those subjects, all the attention has shifted to the sciences.' Views like this explain why Clanchy is a popular figure among other girls' school headmistresses - in great part due to her opposition to the introduction of national curriculum tests for 14-year-olds. In March last year she fired off one of her first shots: 'The more we learn about the tests the more insensitive, bureaucratic and absurd they seem. My school, like all the others at the top of the league table, will not be doing them.' To make her point clearer, she then resigned from the National Curriculum Council. This decision, she later told a sympathetic audience at the Girls' Schools Association, had only been taken after several late nights agonising in her kitchen. In her resignation letter, she told Patten: 'The dominant aim has become a curriculum designed for tests, and the result is a model of English teaching which is barren and anti-intellectual. It is almost as if there is a determination on the part of the council to pick a fight with English teachers.' It was as if, she said, 'the Highway Code had been narrowed down to instructions on the three-point turn'. Until then, Patten had assumed that objections to testing were restricted to a handful of ideologically motivated teachers' union activists. Heedless of Clanchy's warning, he chose to battle on, believing he could beat the teachers in the battle for public opinion. He was wrong. She treated this with icy disdain. Like many in the educational profession she felt he should have been relieved of his post at least a year earlier than he was, and referred to him as 'the Great Unshuffled'  - a nickname that was to become very popular in the teaching profession. Shephard would do well to pay her more heed.
19940903000000000	FT  03 SEP 94 / Girls just wanna be number one: John Authers on why the female of the species is top of the class in the UK. North London Collegiate, the girls' school whose pupils this year scored better in GCSE exams than any other independent school's, was once proud of its cookery and needlework lessons. Not any more. Its old cookery room has been converted for craft, design and technology. The move highlights a transformation in the aspirations and confidence of girls' schools. Not only are more girls studying traditional boys' subjects  -they are beating them across the board. 'Girls overtook boys at GCSE level (the main exams for 16-year-olds in England and Wales) a few years ago, and it would not surprise me if they've now overtaken at A-level as well,' says Mrs Joan Clanchy, headmistress at North London Collegiate. The figures support her claim. League tables, which rank schools by exam performance, have shown girls' schools persistently matching and even beating better resourced boys' schools. Complete figures for the state sector's performance in this year's public exams will not be available until November. But yesterday's GCSE rankings for independent schools showed girls' schools occupying 18 of the top 20 places. At North London Collegiate, 81.5 per cent of all the GCSEs taken resulted in the top 'A' or 'A-star' grades. Similarly, last week's A-level result league tables for independent schools showed sharp improvements by girls' schools - notably boarding schools. Malvern Girls' College rose to 13th, from an average over the past five years of 42nd, while Roedean improved to 27th from 96th. League table rankings such as these are helping girls' schools beat off fresh competition for pupils from the many boys' schools that opened their doors to girls in the 1980s. Mrs Ann Longley, headmistress of Roedean, said: 'The facts show single-sex girls' schools are doing an excellent job. Girls would not choose to stay if they were not enjoying the single-sex environment and feeling fulfilled.' Single-sex education is coming back into vogue and is even being reintroduced in some schools. From this autumn, for example, Shenfield High, a mixed school in Essex, is responding to parents' demands by teaching its boys and girls in separate classes. Other state schools are considering doing the same. But this league table evidence may not be the vindication of single-sex education for girls it at first seems to be. Girls appear to be doing better whatever school they attend. Over the past decade, girls' examination results have improved far faster than boys' at all levels of education from the age of 16. According to the Department for Education, in 1992, 45 per cent of girls passed five GCSEs at grade C or above (equivalent to a pass in the old O-level), while 38 per cent of boys reached the same standard. That suggests girls' schools may do best in league tables simply because they have more girls. The disparity between the two sexes has been widening for the past decade. The introduction of GCSEs in 1988, with a greater emphasis on coursework than O-levels, may have benefited girls who, educationists agree, tend to be more disciplined in their study than boys at the age of 16. Mr Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, which represents the most prestigious boys and co-educational schools, says that at GCSE level boys 'are much more likely than girls to decide they don't care'. A more profound reason for girls' growing success from 16 is that they have become more ambitious in the past two decades about careers. Government estimates suggest that 40.1 per cent of 18-year-old girls will attempt 'A' levels next year, against about 33.6 per cent of boys. That represents a wider disparity than in 1992, when the respective figures were 31 per cent and 26 per cent; 10 years ago the equivalent figures were 22.3 per cent and 21.1 per cent. More women are also going to university. Government figures this week showed women accounted for 49.5 per cent of higher education graduates last year, up from 43 per cent a decade ago. Female graduates even tend to be more employable than men, with only 8.2 per cent of them unemployed by the end of their year of graduation, against 12.25 per cent of men. Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, says the increase in the number of women in higher education has helped 'ensure that the potential of over half the population is fully realised'. According to the Equal Opportunities Commission, the figures are indicative of how women's aspirations and expectations of themselves at last equal those of men. Mrs Clanchy, of North London Collegiate, believes girls lack the complacency of boys. Her experience is that boys with a GCSE in French will describe themselves as 'fluent', while girls will say they have 'a little French'. The rise of the female in Britain's schools has not, however, been uniform. Science and technology continue to be perceived as feminine 'no-go areas'. Women are outnumbered by five to one in university engineering and technology courses, and by four to one in mathematics degrees. Girls' schools, which used to reinforce gender stereotypes by teaching cooking, now see their role as challenging them by encouraging girls to take an interest in these 'masculine preserves'. Mr Declan O'Neill, development director of Malvern Girls' College, says: 'There was a time when there was a stereotyped image of girls' boarding schools as qualified finishing or art schools. I'm glad to say league tables have disproved that. Now parents are most interested if they think their daughter can do well in science.'
19940903000000000	FT  03 SEP 94 / Independent girls' schools dominate GCSE results. Girls' schools dominate this year's performance in GCSE examinations by independent schools. When schools were ranked by the proportion of GCSEs - the main examinations for 16-year-olds in England and Wales - resulting in a pass at grades A to C (equivalent to an old O-level pass), 18 of the top 20 schools were for girls only. When ranked according to their proportion of A-grades, girls' schools were similarly dominant, accounting for 17 of the top 20. A total of 47.7 per cent of entries in girls' schools scored an A grade, compared with 39.6 per cent for independent schools as a whole. They enjoyed even greater success in the starred-A grade, introduced this year to recognise outstanding achievement. It was awarded to 2.9 per cent of all GCSE entries nationally, including the state sector, but to 9.9 per cent of entries from independent schools. At Withington Girls' School in Manchester 44.5 per cent of GCSEs entered resulted in a starred-A. Mrs Margaret Kenyon, headmistress of Withington Girls' and president of the Girls' Schools Association, said: 'Girls flourish in girls' schools.' Overall, the disparity between GCSE performance in independent and state-sector schools appears to have widened since last year. In private schools, according to figures provided by the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis), 39.6 per cent of entries were graded A or better, up from 37.8 per cent last year. The figure for all schools is 13.2 per cent, up from 12.7 per cent last year. Independent school pupils enjoyed more success in gaining at least a C-grade, with 89.4 per cent of entries achieving this level, compared with 53.1 per cent for the nation as a whole. Isis also revealed that candidates had taken an average of 9.1 subjects each, rebutting allegations that schools were stopping pupils from entering in their weaker subjects to boost their league table standings. Mr Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, which represents the most prestigious independent boys' and mixed schools, said the results showed girls performed much better academically than boys at 16. He suggested, however, that the figures did not prove that girls performed better in a single-sex environment. He pointed out that boys' performance was roughly equal to that of girls at A-level, which most pupils in the independent sector regard as more important than GCSEs because they are used to determine university places.

19940827000000000	FT  27 AUG 94 / Independent Schools - FT 500: The old powers remain at the top of the league - John Authers assesses the results of the FT analysis of this summer's A-level results. Football fans will recognise the latest league tables of independent schools' A-level results. A wealthy elite in the big cities gets first choice of all the most promising talent, so barely half a dozen have even a chance of coming first. Outside this premier league, competition is often fiercer, but the top positions are out of reach. Each of this year's top four schools - Westminster, Eton, St Paul's and Winchester - has had an average placing in the top five in the previous five years, while only one of the top 12 - Downe House, a Berkshire girls' boarding school - had not had an average ranking in the top 20. Big-city day schools with wide catchment areas, and boarding schools with an international reputation such as Eton and Winchester, attract more applicants and are able to select abler students. In many cases they also have strong financial resources, and their reputations make them proof against the recession. Fears that the stratified English education system has created a self-reinforcing elite seem to have some justification. All the top four schools were among the nine 'great' public schools identified by the Clarendon Commission 130 years ago. The other five - Harrow (34th), Charterhouse (45th), Shrewsbury (46th), Merchant Taylors' (49th) and Rugby (65th) - all fared well. Meanwhile the wind of recession blew through the rest of the independent sector, with boarding numbers falling by 5.5 per cent. With fewer children applying, many schools have no choice but to become less selective. There are no A-level results printed here for the schools which have closed or merged with others since the end of last term, such as Felixstowe College in Suffolk, or Lawnside near Malvern. The FT excludes from its survey schools which have less than 10 candidates, as results for such schools might be statistically insignificant. This year, that meant cutting out 28, several of which produced weak results. The enduring strength of the traditional elite is the most startling feature of the table, but the showing by girls' schools outside the elite is scarcely less impressive. Girls' schools have poorer resources than boys' schools. They are also coming under increasing competition from boys' schools which have opened their sixth forms to girls, such as Westminster. But this year, several girls' schools, most spectacularly Downe House, registered impressive leaps in the tables compared with their usual performance. At face value, these results are a strong case against co-education. The highest-ranked school which is mixed throughout its age groups, rather than just in the sixth form, is Bablake School in Coventry, which came 37th. This may be due to the historical accident that most independent schools are single-sex, and those which are already the most successful have no incentive to change. But Sue Cameron, headmistress of Downe House, suggests that single-sex education allows girls to avoid the sexual stereotype that they should not do science. The school's 10 successful Oxbridge applicants include students going on to read chemistry, material sciences and experimental psychology. League tables themselves arouse controversy. While schools, particularly in the independent sector, accept that rankings are inevitable, A-level results can be judged in several ways, which lead to different league tables. The FT's statisticians, using data supplied by the Independent Schools Information Service, have tried to make these tables as inclusive, and as proof against manipulation, as possible. They are based on total UCAS points, which include both A-levels, and the new AS-levels ('Advanced Supplementary') which are intended to be as difficult as A-levels, but with smaller syllabuses. All grades achieved, not just As and Bs, are taken into account, giving a full picture of a school's academic strength, and crediting extra options such as AS levels. However, general studies A-level, which is often ignored by university admissions tutors, has been excluded from all the FT's calculations. The FT has also aimed to avoid over-simplification by ranking schools using two separate scores - UCAS points per entry, and UCAS points per pupil. The former gives the average grade in each exam taken, while the latter gives the total grades each pupil has on average accumulated. Arguments could be made for either measure. The former can be manipulated by deliberately withdrawing pupils from A-levels where they do not seem likely to do well, while the latter rewards 'exam factories' where pupils commonly take more than the standard three subjects. League tables compiled using the two measures would be different, as a glance down the columns headed UCAS points per entry and UCAS points per pupil shows. The two have been combined to give the ranking score (for which the precise formula is points per pupil plus three times the points per candidate divided by four). As the bald ranking can unfairly accentuate what are often marginal differences between schools' results, the figure in the second column gives an 'FT score' which shows by how much a school has varied from the norm. This is calculated so that an average school will score 1.00. This was achieved by the schools ranked from 262 to 269, and is equivalent to roughly 18 UCAS points, or three Cs per pupil. By comparison, Westminster, with an FT score of 1.54, was 54 per cent better than the norm. If this sounds a little bland, consider that Westminster's pupils achieved this score by amassing 314 A-grades - rather more than half the total - along with 129 Bs, 51 Cs, 19 Ds and four Es. They only failed four A-levels between them. At a less exalted level, schools can be separated by 20 or 30 positions in the rankings, but have almost identical FT scores. If this is the case, it would be unwise to put emphasis on the 'superior' school's higher ranking. One disadvantage of ranking by A-level results is that it is almost impossible to treat fairly schools which ask students to study more subjects in the sixth-form, via Scottish Highers, or the International Baccalaureate. Both are respected by universities, while the Headmasters' Conference, which represents the most prestigious independent boy's schools says A-levels have 'passed their sell-by date' because they are too specialised. No schools offering Scottish Highers have been included, as there is no agreed fair way to rank them. However, they will be covered in the FT-1,000 guide to secondary schools, published in October. The figures for Cheltenham College, Malvern College, and Sevenoaks School incorporate results for some candidates for the International Baccalaureate, using an agreed points conversion scheme. All three are probably disadvantaged as the baccalaureate is regarded as a harder qualification. It is reserved for the ablest pupils who might have piled up As in A-levels. Even so, if Sevenoaks' IB candidates are treated as one 'school', they finish seventh. Once A-level candidates are included, the school ranks in the 50s. These FT tables have two more profound disadvantages. One is that they cover only independent schools, and so do not enter into the question of whether it is worth opting out of the state sector. The FT-1,000 will incorporate state schools, but there is no central statistical body for the state sector to parallel the role of Isis for independent schools, so we are not yet able to publish complete statistics for them. A second disadvantage is that they do not control for a school's ability to select its pupils. The main factor behind the success of the top schools is that most of their pupils are very able, and their success is thus of no interest to parents with less academically able children who would not be able to gain admission. A system which takes into account pupils' ability and sees how much value schools in the state-maintained and independent sectors have added would be more useful. This is harder to deliver than it sounds, but one of the first attempts to assess 'value-added', produced by statisticians at the Department for Education, suggests strongly that independent schools can improve children's A-level scores. It compared the A-level point-scores that students achieved last year with the score they had obtained in their GCSE exams. As might be expected, children who did well at GCSE were the most likely to get good A-level grades. But the statisticians found that, regardless of a pupil's achievements at GCSE, they were more likely to get good A-levels in independent schools than in the state sector. For example, 42 per cent of the state school pupils achieving 70 or more GCSE points (equivalent to 10 grade As) went on to get three or more grade As at A-level. But this feat was managed by 61 per cent of independent school pupils with similar GCSEs. At a level within reach of rather more children, 11 per cent of independent school pupils who had only managed between 45 and 49 GCSE points - equivalent to about eight B-grades - went on to score three As at A-level; while 56 per cent of them managed at least 15 A-level points. In state schools, only 1 per cent of pupils with GCSE scores in this range achieved three As or better at A-level, while only a quarter managed 15 A-level points. These figures must carry a health warning. This is their first year, and they may prove to be a freak. Even independent schools were surprised by them, as they felt that they should already have added value to their pupils by the time they took GCSE. It is theoretically possible, albeit unlikely, that private schools look good on this analysis because their children underperform at the age of 16. As they stand, the figures must be accepted as a powerful case for independent education, at least at sixth-form level.
19940827000000000	FT  27 AUG 94 / Girls' schools graduate up A-level exam league table. Girls' schools have risen sharply in the A-level examination rankings of independent schools published in today's Financial Times. Schools believe that parents' choice of where they send their children is being affected by the A-level league tables, now in their third year of widespread publication. Girls' boarding schools showed the strongest improvement, with Downe House, near Newbury, Berkshire, rising to eighth place from an average over the previous five years of 59th. Other impressive performances by boarding schools came from Malvern Girls' College (13th, up from an average of 42nd), Badminton (19th from 76th) and Roedean (27th from 96th). Girls' day schools also improved on last year. Five members of the Girls' Public Day School Trust, a network of schools which aims to charge relatively low fees, were in the top 50 - South Hampstead, Notting Hill & Ealing, Brighton & Hove, Wimbledon and Oxford High Schools. The top girls' school, for the second year running, was North London Collegiate, a selective day school. The results are likely to sustain the recent recovery in demand for single-sex girls' education. Girls' schools had seemed to be under serious threat during the 1980s when many boys' boarding schools, which usually have greater resources, were going co-educational either completely or just in the sixth form. At the end of last term Felixstowe College, a large girls' boarding school in Suffolk, closed because of declining rolls. Mr Declan O'Neill, development officer for Malvern Girls' College, said publication of league tables had encouraged parents to look at his school. In particular, many were concerned girls would perform better in the sciences in a single-sex school. In university entrance, boys outnumber girls by six to one on engineering and technology courses and three to one in mathematics. However, Downe House, Malvern and Roedean reported that maths had been their most popular subject and girls had moved on to science degrees. Mrs Ann Longley, headmistress of Roedean, said that competition from boarding schools with mixed sixth forms had dwindled. A-level domination, Page 6 Britain's top independent schools, Weekend XIV & XV
19940827000000000	FT  27 AUG 94 / 'Great public schools' still dominant at A-level. The 'great public schools' identified by the Clarendon Commission 130 years ago dominate the rankings of independent schools' A-level results analysed by the Financial Times today. All the top four - Westminster, followed by Eton College, St Paul's and Winchester College - were named by the Clarendon report, which aimed to identify the best boys' schools in Victorian England. The lowest ranked of the nine Clarendon schools in today's table is Rugby, which, at 65th, still had results significantly better than the average for the independent sector. The results, based on figures supplied by the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis), suggest that parents looking for the best chance of strong academic performance need to pay for the privilege, with all the top four schools last year charging significantly more than the average. There were exceptions, however. Manchester Grammar, which was ranked seventh this year, charged more than Pounds 1,000 less than the average day fees for the country as a whole. Girls' schools tended to be significantly cheaper than boys' schools. Several girls' schools also celebrated sharp improvements in their league positions. Mrs Ann Longley, headmistress of Roedean School, near Brighton in East Sussex, which ranked 27th, said: 'This is a confirmation of the success of girls' single-sex education.' Malvern Girls' College, which attracted national publicity two years ago when low payment of fees led it to employ debt-collectors, rose to 13th. It believed that the impact of the recession was receding and that parents were showing more interest in girls' boarding schools following the publication of league tables. The sharp decline in the popularity of boarding over the past few years, which saw the number of boarders fall by 5.5 per cent in 1993-94 following a 6.5 per cent fall the previous year, left the most prestigious schools untouched. Some well-known boarding schools recorded weaker results, however, with Blundell's in Devon finishing 423rd in the FT's analysis while Wrekin College in Shropshire came 442nd. Overall the figures show an improvement of 3.1 per cent in the grade achieved since last year - slightly ahead of the trend for schools in England and Wales as a whole. Of the A-levels entered at Isis schools, 29.4 per cent resulted in A grades and 22.6 per cent in B grades. Only 6.7 per cent resulted in failures. Using the points system adopted by university admissions tutors, where an A is given 10 points and an E two, the average score for each candidate was 20.31 - up from 19.69 last year and equivalent to marks slightly better than one B and two Cs. There were wide regional variations. Greater Manchester schools had the strongest overall A-level performance, with an average of 21.5 A-level points per pupil. Greater London was not far behind on 21. North Wales had the weakest A-level points score on the British mainland, with 16 A-level points per pupil. The Department for Education plans to publish its third annual performance tables for GCSE and A-level results for all British schools in November. Figures for independent schools' performance at GCSE this year will be available from Isis at the end of next week.

19900415000000000	COLUMN ONE; AGONY FOR A CAMPUS: GO CO-ED?; A NEW WAVE OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS IS DEBATING WHETHER TO ADMIT MEN. FOR OAKLAND'S MILLS COLLEGE, AND OTHERS, THE CHOICE MAY BE TO ADAPT OR FAIL.. The elegant bell tower at Mills College survived the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989, chiming with soothing regularity on the leafy campus. The bells still ring at what many educators consider to be the finest women's college on the West Coast, but some people now hear the tolls as mourning the end of beloved traditions. Facing declining enrollment and financial worries, Mills' trustees next month are expected to decide either to admit undergraduate men for the first time in the school's 138-year history or to begin a strong push for part-time and older women students. Either way, Mills will change a lot, symbolizing the situation of many women's colleges nationwide. "We must either become more attractive to a greater number of women or we must admit men," Mills' President Mary S. Metz said. The school wants to increase the number of undergraduates from the current 777 to 1,000 without dropping standards. In the mid-1970s, there were more than 900. The specter of coeducation is causing much debate and anxiety at Mills, a beautiful 135-acre campus that has 5,500 trees and is cut off from the surrounding Oakland neighborhood by a barbed-wire fence. "It's a very overwhelming, very emotional issue," explained Robyn Fisher, student body president, who said most students want Mills to remain a women's school. Although it may be of little consolation to those students, Mills is not alone in its dilemma. Over the last 30 years, the number of women's colleges in the United States has dropped from 298 to 94, according to the Women's College Coalition, a Washington lobbying organization. Most of those changes -- campuses either going co-ed, merging with men's schools, or closing -- took place in the late 1960s and early '70s as previously men-only colleges also went co-ed. Such women's schools as Vassar and Sarah Lawrence in New York state changed at that time. Now, a second, smaller wave of conversion to coeducation is occurring. Wheaton College in Massachusetts, Goucher in Maryland, Marymount in Virginia and Colby-Sawyer in New Hampshire have admitted men over the last three years. Mills and Chatham College, a 121-year-old school in Pittsburgh, are considering doing so for the fall of 1991. Other than Mills, only two women's colleges still exist west of the Rockies: Mount St. Mary's in Los Angeles and Scripps in Claremont, both of which say they have no plans to change their mission. Mount St. Mary's is a Catholic school; Mills is nondenominational. And Scripps is part of the Claremont college system, allowing its students to regularly take classes with men. If Mills goes co-ed, it would be the end of a tradition dating back to the founding of the school as a genteel refuge for daughters of Gold Rush prospectors. Some students are threatening to transfer and are wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan: "Better Dead Than Co-Ed." Professors argue about how the presence of men in the classroom might affect teaching and whether the school might actually raise its academic stature nationally by admitting men. "If we become co-ed like other schools, we will not necessarily be successful," said Barbara Li Santi, associate professor of math and computer science at Mills for nine years. "I don't know of students who are beating the doors down now to come to Mills College. To lose our distinction could make it worse." Moreover, she and many other teachers at Mills worry that even a small number of men will dominate classroom discussions and campus activities. They cite scholarly research showing that young women at co-ed schools tend to defer to men in intellectual debate while women at single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than women at co-ed schools. Words like "nurturing" and "empowering" are used regularly by students, alumni and faculty to describe a Mills education. Linda Routsong, senior class president at Mills, explained: "I would not like to see Mills College go co-ed because I feel it's very important in the 20th Century for women to have a place to study without being intimidated in the classroom." Some students and teachers contend that before enrolling males, the college should put five years or so of added effort into recruiting female transfer students and older women who are resuming their educations. The opponents of coeducation point to mixed results among former women's colleges that have gone co-ed. While some of those institutions show a general pattern of enrollment growth and stronger finances, some have encountered extreme social and academic difficulties. However, others think a co-ed Mills could carve out a niche as the best small private nondenominational college on the West Coast north of Occidental in Los Angeles and south of Reed in Portland, Ore. Mills, they say, could build on its strong reputation in music, art, dance, English, education and history and expand into new areas such as environmental studies while attracting students who want an intimate campus and much faculty attention. "We can be a Swarthmore of the West," said Ted Thomas, a sociology professor at Mills for 26 years, referring to the highly regarded liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. Thomas would prefer that Mills remain a women's college if demographics were running in its favor. But he says switching to coeducation now appears "the least risky option." Besides, Thomas added, "intellectual vitality" is at stake. Many classes at Mills have 15 or fewer students, some as few as five. "It's nice to have small classes, but when some are getting down to four or five (students), it's too small for a good exchange of ideas," he said. The basic problem for women's colleges is that, according to various surveys, only between 3% and 10% of women who graduate from high school even consider enrolling at a women's school. "I think it is difficult to convince 17-year-olds that this is an environment that will educate them better," said Zina Jacque, Mills' dean of admissions and financial aid. "Their perception is that it's like coming to a nunnery." (In fact, there are 50 men among the 264 graduate students at Mills and undergraduates can ride a shuttle bus to take courses in the extremely social atmosphere at UC Berkeley. More than a third of Mills' professors are men.) Recruiting has been more difficult in the last few years with the decline in the overall college-age population, a trend expected to last until the mid-1990s when children of baby-boomers start to reach college age in large numbers. In California, the situation is especially difficult because of price competition from UC and Cal State. Excluding room and board, tuition and fees at Mills total $12,700 this year, compared to $1,700 for a state resident at a UC campus. But, according to the Women's College Coalition, full-time undergraduate enrollment at women's schools is up 3.6% over five years ago and part-time students have increased significantly. Meanwhile, such women's schools as Smith, Mt. Holyoke and Wellesley are doing fine and a few campuses such as Russell Sage College in Troy, N.Y., recently decided to remain single-sex by more aggressively recruiting older women. "We know (women's colleges) are viable. We know they can market themselves. We are absolutely confident of that," said coalition spokesman Peter Mirijanian. "When things like Chatham and Mills happen, it is a distraction we have to deal with. But the day we don't have a case on the merits is the day we have problems. I don't think we have those problems." However, Robert Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania, disagrees. "The sort of question you ask is: Is the conversion of women's colleges to co-ed going to be fast enough that those who remain single-sex colleges retain a good share of the market?" Zemsky said. "Nobody's got any data to say the market will go to zero, but it is very difficult marketing." In a recent interview, F. Warren Hellman, the prominent San Francisco investment banker who is chairman of Mills' Board of Trustees, declined to state his position on coeducation in advance of the May 3 meeting when a decision is scheduled to be made. But many on campus believe Hellman is tilted toward going co-ed. Mills is not in a dire financial crisis, Hellman explained. In fact, its endowment is now about $72 million, a respectable amount for a small school and nearly triple what it was a decade ago. In addition, Mills has had much success in seeking donations to build a new library and to fund scholarships. But with declining enrollment, Hellman said, the school is dipping into the endowment too much to meet operating costs. Last year's budget was balanced by eliminating 17 non-teaching jobs. This year, four full-time faculty jobs are to be cut from the teaching staff of 167. Mills also needs $7 million to repair its administration headquarters, a grand Victorian building that was damaged in last October's earthquake. "I guess it's the feeling of the board that we have to make some changes while we are still strong in terms of a substantial endowment, a fine faculty, and providing a fine educational experience, rather than waiting until the college is in very severe financial difficulty," Hellman said. His critics contend that Hellman ignores the philosophical benefits to single-sex education. "I keep being beaten about the ears with moral issues," Hellman said. "But isn't another kind of moral issue whether you have some unbelievable asset in a jewel of a campus and you under-utilize it? Is it better to have no campus at all? . . . The trustees are trying to act in long-term interests of the college and if students want to get mad at anybody, they should get mad at high school students for not wanting to come to a women's college." No one expects that changing to coeducation would be easy. Zemsky, of the University of Pennsylvania, likened such conversions to "stepping off a six-foot-high diving board, knowing there is a swimming pool below you but not knowing how deep the water is." Other experts say it takes at least 10 years to work out problems and approach enrollment parity between the sexes. More than 20 years after going coeducational, women still outnumber men 70% to 30% at Sarah Lawrence, while at Vassar females have a smaller edge, 55% to 45%. "I don't think success or failure should be based on those numbers," said Marilyn Katz, dean of studies and student life at Sarah Lawrence. "You should base it on the experience of the men, and the men here overall have had a good experience. I don't think we've ever been sorry about it." Katz, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1954, said coeducation has created "a more charged" social atmosphere than when she was a student there. "There's a low level of spring fever all year long," she said. Goucher College near Baltimore began to enroll men two years ago. "I would be lying to tell you the first year was sunshine and roses," said spokeswoman Judy Phair. "There were some pretty tough times because some women students were unhappy and let the male students know it." About 30% of current freshmen there are men. Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., had a court fight with alumni donors angry that the school began to admit men in September, 1988. In an out-of-court settlement, the school returned a total of $127,000 to donors from a $26-million fund-raising campaign. On the positive side, applications to Wheaton reportedly have doubled over the last three years and enrollment has grown 15%. To accommodate men, who are outnumbered 5 to 1, Wheaton is building a new sports facility and buying longer beds. But the school balked at what administrators jokingly call "the great bathroom question." Stand-up urinals are not being installed in dormitory bathrooms. Meanwhile, life at Mills remains tense as the campus awaits the May 3 meeting. Counselors are planning so-called "grief therapy" sessions for students if the trustees vote for coeducation. The alumni office has been trying to defuse anger among potential donors. A few days ago, on the steps of the tea shop, which is the center of campus social life, student government treasurer Lisa Kosiewicz was selling T-shirts and sweat shirts. "These may soon be a collector's item," she explained. On the front of the shirts was the school motto -- "Mills College: Not a Girl's School Without Men, but a Women's College Without Boys." Business was brisk.
19890720000000000	SEPARATE SESSIONS FOR BOYS, GIRLS; IRVINE TO SEGREGATE SEX EDUCATION CLASS. Boys and girls will be segregated during sex education in junior high school next year under a trial plan approved by Irvine school officials. The Irvine Unified School District Board of Education, responding to a survey of parents, voted 5-0 late Tuesday to separate seventh- and eight-grade boys and girls for one week of a 12-week health education course. About 50 people attended the school board meeting Tuesday night, including four parents who told trustees they should honor the wishes of the majority of those surveyed who want their children separated by sex. Many parents had argued, and the board agreed, that students might feel more comfortable discussing some sexual topics separately. "We need to protect our children," said parent Barry Hammond. "Sometimes we rush them a little too much." About two weeks of the health course are devoted to sex education. Students will be segregated for a one-week portion dealing with human sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases. School officials said that separating the sexes will cost about $4,500 for extra staff and equipment. The board agreed to review the plan after a year. District administrators had recommended that the trustees vote to continue teaching sex education in middle school to coeducational classes, even though the district's own recent survey shows that a majority of parents favor splitting the boys and girls into separate classes. They noted that the students overwhelmingly support coeducational sex education classes. "I really think we ought to hear what (the students) are saying," said Judy Cunningham, principal at Rancho San Joaquin Middle School. "We have very mature people that we expect a great deal from . . . that we expect to make heavy decisions in this particular course. They handle the situation really well." In the survey of parents, 57% of those polled said human sexuality should be taught in separate classes for boys and girls. But in a separate survey of 800 middle-school students, 76% said they do not object to being in the same classroom as students of the opposite sex. The Board of Education commissioned the community survey after several parents objected earlier this year to a new required health course for middle-school students in which the topics of drugs, AIDS, anorexia and sexual development are discussed. It was the fact that boys and girls were in the same classroom when the subject of human sexuality was discussed that seemed to bother parents the most, according to Board of Education President Margie Wakeham. "Every time the family life or human sexuality curriculum comes up for review, there is concern by the parents," she said. Wakeham and board member Helen Cameron favored keeping students together during sex education classes and separating them for only one day at the end of the course for a question-and-answer session. "I think it's a mistake for us educators to make (sex) a mystique that you can't talk about," Wakeham said. She said she believed students should be informed about human sexuality and allowed to ask questions "in the best, most honest, direct way possible." But board member Gordon G. Getchel, who led the move to segregate students for the week of sex education lessons, said the board should be responsive to parents' concerns because the topic -- unlike math or physics -- is one that has to do with the values of a family. Deputy Supt. Bruce Givner noted that while the survey shows most parents want boys and girls taught separately during the human sexuality discussion of the 12-week course, an overwhelming majority -- 91% -- said they agree that information regarding sexuality should be taught as part of a planned curriculum in the middle schools. Those parents who objected to combining the students for the discussions said they felt the students might be uncomfortable asking questions in a mixed group. But of those parents whose children have taken the course, only 27% said their children felt uncomfortable discussing sensitive topics in a class with both boys and girls present. Surveys were sent to 3,000 homes, but only 757 responded. The student surveys were conducted in the middle schools. Givner said the curriculum includes two sections called Stars and Stages, which show students how to resist peer pressure in a situation where drugs or sex come up, and how to deal with changes in their lives, such as those caused by a divorce in the family. Givner said that the schools work hard to let parents know what the students will hear and see during the course and that they also have the option of excluding their child from the portion of the health curriculum dealing with human sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases.

19890813000000000	BRITISH BOY'S SCHOOL SAYS IT'S TOO MACHO FOR GIRLS, SCRAPS COEDUCATION PROGRAM. A British boys' school run by Roman Catholic monks has scrapped an experiment in admitting girls, saying its sporty regimen was too macho for them. Belmont Abbey School, near Hereford in western England, has become the first British fee-paying school to return to single-sex status after becoming coeducational. "We took the decision on educational grounds. There was no scandal, no pregnancies and we are not misogynists," headmaster Father Christopher Jenkins said.
19891102000000000	PARENTS' REVOLT DELAYS MERGER OF 2 SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: BATTLE OVER WESTLAKE SCHOOL FOR GIRLS AND HARVARD SCHOOL FOR BOYS IS AN UPHILL STRUGGLE.. A proposed merger of Westlake School for girls and Harvard School for boys has been delayed a month amid a continuing revolt by parents. The 30-day delay of the final vote, announced on the eve of the Westlake Board of Trustees meeting last Thursday, is the first indication that the merger of the two prestigious schools, promoted as a "done deal," might come undone. Conceding that they face an uphill struggle, parents have mounted a multi-pronged attack on the plan that, if approved, would mean the end of the 85-year-old all-girls school. They are poised to ask the state attorney general to block the merger as ill-conceived and hastily announced. In a draft of a letter to Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, which has not been sent, they charge that the board has acted capriciously on anecdotal advice, without the due diligence required under the California Corporations Code. A surprise announcement last month that the two schools would be merged into Harvard-Westlake School in 1991 triggered an intense backlash among Westlake parents that has not abated despite efforts by the board and administration to downplay its depth. The brouhaha is a battle royal involving many of the city's movers and shakers. Philanthropist couple Helen and Peter Bing, the largest benefactors of Westlake and Harvard, are enthusiastic backers of the merger. The Westlake Board of Trustees is dotted with names such as Sam Goldwyn, Aaron Spelling and David May II, of the department store family. At a recent parents meeting held in an auditorium named for director Garry Marshall, singer Howard Keel boomed out his dismay about the proposed merger. A number of players have ties at both schools and in the community. Richard Close has a daughter at Westlake and a son who graduated from Harvard last year. Wearing his hat as president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., Close said he fears that the merger will bring more traffic to Coldwater Canyon Boulevard in neighboring Studio City, home of Harvard, which will provide the high school campus under the merger plan. The junior high grades will be taught at the Holmby Hills Westlake campus. If either school came to the city seeking conditional-use permits or zoning changes, the matter could come before one of two key city commissions. A Westlake father sits on the Planning Commission, and a Harvard father sits on the Board of Zoning Appeals. Despite the postponement, Harvard sent out a bulletin to its parents this week saying the merger was expected to go forward. Harvard Headmaster Thomas C. Hudnut said in an interview that he based his optimism on assurances from his counterpart at Westlake, Nathan Reynolds, who did not respond to several requests for comment. According to Hudnut, Reynolds said the delay would provide more time "to bring more trustees up to speed" about the disputed issue. Opponents of the merger are skeptical that it is a now-or-never matter that must be speedily enacted while a "window of opportunity" is open, a posture that makes Westlake the suitor. They question the premise on which the merger was based -- that Westlake could not compete with a Harvard expected to go coeducational on its own. Underlying the dissension is a philosophy -- demonstrated in research and fostered by the headmaster who now favors a merger -- that single-sex education is superior for girls. Even those who are not opposed to coeducation take issue with the deal's terms, which give Harvard a 2-1 majority on the board of trustees. "This is not a merger, it's an acquisition," said Rod Berle, a member of the Westlake Board of Trustees. Another festering issue is religion. Harvard, whose bylaws will govern the merged institution, falls under the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Diocese, a relationship some Westlake parents do not like. The intense opposition has been fueled by revelations large and small. A wire service report from 1978 was unearthed in which the Harvard headmaster extolled the benefits of his membership in an exclusive Washington, D.C., males-only club. The Westlake administration's private opinion about Harvard boys -- that they are "obnoxious" -- also was revealed in a confidential memo distributed to members at a board retreat in June and obtained by The Times. On a page entitled "Problems for Harvard if They Go Co-Ed," under the subheading "Intimidating Atmosphere at Harvard," an administrator whose name is not contained on the document wrote the following: "Only the most socially aggressive and confident girls will feel comfortable after visiting Harvard. The admissions office doesn't encourage families to visit now because the boys are so obnoxious. Imagine the possibilities when little girls start to visit for the first time." The memo mentions an incident involving a Westlake student who appeared at a Harvard assembly to promote a joint production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" and who complained of harassment from the boys. Hudnut said the incident was an "eye of the beholder" situation. Women faculty members in the front row did not detect any disrespect in the boys' behavior, their headmaster said. As for his membership in the Cosmos Club, which has since changed its policies to admit women, Hudnut said, "It is irrelevant." According to Hudnut, belonging to the club was a "very useful adjunct" in Washington that did not detract from his ability to educate both sexes. Opponents of the merger have been rankled by what they perceive as the presumption of the pro-merger forces. At an emotional meeting in which parents repeatedly asked to have a voice in the merger decision, Westlake board President Alan Levy replied testily, "This is not a shareholders' meeting. There are no stockholders in this corporation." Although that is technically correct, because the power is vested in the Board of Trustees, such statements have galvanized opponents of the merger, who are not accustomed to being dismissed so summarily. According to Berle, the Westlake board has hired former Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Harry Handler to evaluate the data about the predicted dearth of high-quality applicants for Westlake if Harvard goes co-ed without it. A number of committees seeking parent reaction have also been formed. "Window dressing," Berle said. Parents are also critical of a letter that went out this month on pre-printed "Harvard-Westlake" stationery to elementary schools where sixth-graders might apply for admission. Attorney David Higgins, a Westlake parent, said the mailing was a "dangerous thing for the board to allow to happen," creating liability by presenting something that had not yet been approved by the board. Meanwhile, a fund-raising campaign is under way to demonstrate to the board that Westlake will be economically viable if students do defect to a Harvard that goes coeducational on its own. Nearly $100,000 was raised by those at the meeting. In addition, Berle said, he has presented a pledge for a $1-million cushion to protect the school from the loss of large benefactors who might fall away if the merger collapses. In particular, many parents, though not for attribution, say Helen Bing as a source of funds would be lost if Westlake remains as it is. Bing's generosity is a mainstay of the school. Though merger opponents are far from claiming victory, Berle said, there are many more "borderline" board members than there were three weeks ago. Nevertheless, Hudnut predicted that despite the scrutiny, the merger will hang together. "I think the overriding benefits of it will be sufficiently clear to the people whose responsibility it is to make the deal go forward," he said.
19901118000000000	MERGER OF CATHOLIC GIRLS, BOYS SCHOOLS TO CUT COSTS. In 1960, when David Escarcega was a sophomore at Cantwell High School, the girls of Sacred Heart of Mary High School, just across Hay Avenue, were tantalizingly near. Under the watchful eyes of the Sacred Heart of Mary sisters, the Catholic boys of Cantwell High came no closer to the girls during school hours than a lingering glance through the chain-link fence. "The sisters were very restrictive," recalled Escarcega, whose wife, Christine, attended Sacred Heart of Mary while he was at Cantwell. "Though we used to look at the girls from afar, the best we could do was cruise by." Escarcega's memory of how it was between young men and women in Catholic schools in the Montebello area is all that is left of a 40-year tradition that will come to an end next year. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has announced that dwindling enrollment and the soaring cost of a private education have forced it to merge Cantwell High School with Sacred Heart of Mary High School. The coeducational school will be called Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High School. In a similar move in the San Gabriel Valley, the all-boys La Salle High School in Pasadena will admit girls for the first time next September. The La Salle move does not, however, involve a merger. La Salle is a Catholic School run by the Christian Brothers, and officials have cited a desire to offer an alternative to mostly single-sex Catholic high schools, as well as broadening their enrollment base, as reasons for going co-ed. Sacred Heart of Mary, which has been owned by the order of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary since 1942, will be closed, said Sister Joan Treacy, the provincial superior of the order. Treacy said that the order's decision to keep tuition costs low to allow more students to attend the school has created such a financial burden that the order can no longer afford to operate it. For many, especially the alumni of both schools, the consolidation means the end of an era. But students, parents and alumni said that there is little option, given the bleak enrollment figures and studies that reveal a shrinking pool of students will enter Catholic schools. "I hate to see it go," said Escarcega, whose son, Marc, is now a senior at Cantwell. "At one time I thought that, if I wanted my son to have a co-ed education I would have sent him to a public school or to Amat (Bishop Amat, a co-ed school), but I'm more open minded now. . . . I look at it as one chapter closing and another opening." The possibility that Cantwell would become a coeducational school had been rumored for years, but it became a matter of serious discussion about three years ago when the archdiocese commissioned a study of the problem of dwindling enrollment in its schools. Cantwell has a capacity for 600 students, but is now only serving 250 students, a 50% drop in the number of students enrolled five years ago. Most of the students come from the East Los Angeles, Montebello and San Gabriel Valley area. Bill Rivera, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said the study by the archdiocese recommended several options to buoy enrollment, including an aggressive recruiting campaign and the consolidation with Sacred Heart of Mary. In April, the leadership of the Sacred Heart of Mary announced that it could not afford to continue operating the high school. The archdiocese then made its decision to consolidate, Rivera said. Sister Laura Siebert, the principal of Sacred Heart of Mary, said that as long as five years ago the order realized it could not continue operating the school as it had, and shortly thereafter began talks with the archdiocese. During the past two years, students have been told that the school might become co-ed, and students who wanted to attend an all-girls' school were encouraged to transfer. "We haven't made any secret about it," Siebert said. Many Sacred Heart of Mary teachers are expected to continue working at Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary, Rivera said. Several committees have been formed to oversee such details as the writing of Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary's new school philosophy statement and its modification of curriculum. Siebert said that her students, for the most part, are looking forward to the consolidation. "There has to be a lot of change . . . but out of the combination we will come up with things that will make both schools better," she said. "We could have programs that neither school could afford on its own, such as fine arts or drama." Some Cantwell students initially resisted the idea of sharing their classrooms with girls. Many said they didn't want the school's name, its colors and mascot to change, or endure having its creed of "Act Manfully" neutered. Others said they feared that camaraderie among the boys would disappear as soon they began competing for the attentions of their new classmates. The name change is still a sore spot with Cantwell alumni and some students, but most are looking at the consolidation of the schools as a practical matter, a necessity that must be faced to keep a good Catholic school in Montebello. And, students said, a coeducational classroom could be a lot of fun. "We're not mad about it," said sophomore Gabriel Arenas. "A lot of guys are happy that girls are going to be at the school."

In the San Fernando Valley, Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, formerly for boys only, went coeducational in 1982, causing a student shift that helped drive Our Lady of Corvallis, a girls school in Studio City, out of existence in 1987. That left Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino the sole remaining Catholic all-boys school and Louisville High School in Woodland Hills the remaining Catholic girls school in the Valley area. Sacred Heart of Mary, which has been owned by the order of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary since 1942, will be closed, said Sister Joan Treacy, the provincial superior of the order. It is the same order of nuns that ran Corvallis in Studio City until 1981, and Marymount in Bel-Air. Treacy said that the order's decision to keep tuition costs low to allow more students to attend Sacred Heart of Mary has created such a financial burden that the order can no longer afford to operate the school.

19891130000000000	HARVARD-WESTLAKE MERGER IS FOCUS OF LAWSUIT; EDUCATION: A MINORITY OF WESTLAKE SCHOOL TRUSTEES JOINS SOME PARENTS IN ALLEGING THAT THE PRESTIGIOUS GIRLS INSTITUTION IS BEING GIVEN AWAY TO THE ALL-BOY HARVARD CAMPUS.. After voting 16 to 5 to merge with Harvard School, trustees from Westlake School adjourned Monday night to Jimmy's restaurant to celebrate a "wonderful dream" come true. "What this is about is creating a wonderful school (that will) set standards not just for the West but for the United States," exulted Westlake Trustee Sheldon Sloan. "We're going to have a first-class prep school in this town the likes of which has not been seen before." Absent from the festivities at the tony Beverly Hills eatery were a small group of trustees who viewed the merger as the death of a dream that was Westlake School. In their effort to preserve the independence of the prestigious Holmby Hills school whose graduates include actress Candace Bergen and astronaut Sally Ride, opponents of the merger, including two trustees, have filed suit seeking to block it. The suit contends that the merger was ill-conceived and was brought to a vote without sufficient consideration of the options. The opponents also contend that the deal was engineered by a group of wealthy, socially prominent people led by Peter and Helen Bing. The Bings, West Los Angeles residents who are active in a variety of local philanthropic efforts, have close ties to both schools. A third trustee, David May II, a scion of the department store family, quit the board after 24 years as a trustee in protest of the merger, contending that Harvard's ties to the Episcopal Church were not compatible with Westlake's non-sectarian traditions. Opponents say the merger would essentially cede Westlake's $50-million Holmby Hills property to Harvard, whose ex officio board president is Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. In their lawsuit, they point out that an article in the November issue of the diocese newsletter quotes Harvard Headmaster Thomas C. Hudnut as confirming a continued relationship with the church in the merged junior and senior high school. Since the surprise announcement in October that a merger had been agreed upon in principle, the Westlake community has been in an uproar. A coalition of alumnae, parents and students oppose the deal for reasons varying from a preference for single-sex education to a concern that the venerable girls' school had underestimated its value and made a bad business bargain. A majority of Harvard parents favor going co-ed, in keeping with a national trend among private boys' schools. The suit seeking to block the merger was filed by Westlake parents, and has been joined by Trustees Anita May Rosenstein, David May's daughter, and Rodney Berle. The courtroom showdown promises to reveal in considerable detail the inner workings of a group of people who like to keep their business private, particularly the Bings. Helen Bing is a Westlake trustee and benefactor, and Peter Bing, a physician, serves in a similar capacity at Harvard, whose campus is in Studio City. Asked for her thoughts on the merger and her role in it, Helen Bing said: "I really don't have any comment to make." Sworn declarations filed in Los Angeles Superior Court allege that the merger was the work of a cabal of Bing associates on the Westlake board, and that other board members were unwilling to challenge the deal because of the Bings' social prominence and financial power. According to the declarations, Trustee Sloan is an attorney for the Bings, as is Daniel Belin, husband of Trustee Daisy Belin. Helen Bing's personal physician, Gary Gitnick, is also a trustee, the documents said. Sloan declined to comment on his professional ties to the Bings. Belin and Gitnick could not be reached for comment. A letter to the board from David May included in the lawsuit documents notes that in 1981 Helen Bing donated the money to buy a home for Westlake Headmaster Nathan Reynolds and his family, who had been living in what May said were deplorable conditions on campus. May also noted that Bing had vowed to withdraw her financial support for Westlake if she did not get her way about the merger. A blistering attack on the manner in which the merger was handled is included in one letter from May to Helen Bing that is included in the documents. "I feel that everything that you and Peter want to accomplish could have been done very easily if it was done in a businesslike and tasteful manner that you had every right to expect." May goes on to characterize the handling of the merger as "incompetent, lack(ing in) prudent judgment, tasteless, insensitive and heavy-handed." Later in the same letter, May said two expressions he had never before used came to mind in describing the terms of the merger: "male chauvinist" and "sexist." Under the signed merger agreement, the new school will be named Harvard-Westlake, the board will be controlled by current Harvard trustees and Hudnut will run the school. Reynolds, who is nearing retirement age, will be provost. Harvard's Studio City facilities would become the campus for high school-age students, and lower grades would be housed at Westlake. Both Sloan and Reynolds used exactly the same words to respond to the lawsuit's charges that the merger was engineered by the Bings and boosted by cronyism on the Westlake board. "That's nonsense," the two men said in separate interviews. Sloan said the real issue -- education -- has gotten lost amid the fight over the process, which he concedes was imperfect. "There's nothing nefarious. No secret deals. No smoking guns." he said. Helen Bing is by all accounts a tireless worker for Westlake and a major benefactor. "She's an incredible human being," said Sloan. Indeed, even as he criticizes the merger in his letters, May describes Helen Bing as the school's "most valuable trustee," even without considering her financial support. In addition to serving as a Harvard trustee, Peter Bing serves on the Stanford University board and is a director of the Times Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times. Peter Bing's mother is Anna Bing Arnold, whose philanthropic activities are legendary in Los Angeles. The family fortune came from the New York real estate holdings of Arnold's first husband, Leo Bing. In an effort to thwart the merger, the Westlake parents have raised $4.7 million in cash and pledges, with Trustees Berle, television mogul Aaron Spelling and film executive Samuel Goldwyn offering to cover the school's deficit for the next four years if the merger is thwarted -- the assumption being that Westlake may lose some students if Harvard goes co-educational on its own. The lawsuit questions, however, whether Harvard is actually poised to go co-ed on its own, and whether Westlake must immediately decide to merge or be left behind. According to a letter from Hudnut to Harvard parents, the Studio City school has no timetable to become co-ed. In the letter, Hudnut estimated the cost of going co-ed without Westlake at $30 million, and said that if the Westlake merger does not occur, Harvard would be back to "square one," faced with the prospect of raising the money, finding property and building a second campus.
19891207000000000	33-YEAR-OLD LA SALLE HIGH SCHOOL PLANS TO ENROLL GIRLS IN 1990. La Salle High School in Pasadena will open its classroom doors to girls next year for the first time in its 33-year history, making it one of only two coeducational Catholic high schools in the San Gabriel Valley. "It was mainly a desire we had to prepare our school for the next century," said Brother Philip Clarke, the school's principal. "We were examining the types of things that we should take care of in terms of curriculum, programs, activities and sports, and when we examined all this, the obvious question came up of why we are remaining a single-sex school in this day and age," Clarke said. Among the things that sparked the need for the examination, however, was the school's decline in enrollment over the past five years, Clarke said. The school has 320 students, only 64% of its capacity of 500. La Salle hopes to attract 150 girls for the 1990-91 school year, Clarke said. Bishop Amat High School in La Puente also is co-ed. In a survey commissioned by the school, parents of potential future students and alumni have said they would like a co-ed Catholic school in the area, Clarke said, and offering the choice between co-ed and single-sex education was a motivating factor in the decision. "Single-sex for all students is probably not a good idea," said Clarke, who believes that single-sex schools provide positive learning atmospheres. "So the idea of having a choice where parents of students can choose single-sex or choose co-ed is an important factor for us. And in this area, that choice simply has not been available." Both students and faculty have welcomed the decision, with the faculty giving almost unanimous support, Clarke said. "We like the idea of the school going co-ed. It will add new dimensions to the school," said Tom Carter, a sophomore at La Salle. The school plans to spend $500,000 in physical plant renovations and hire 10 more teachers over the next two years, bringing the faculty to 31. La Salle is also planning to undergo less tangible changes in anticipation of the new students. The student government will visit co-ed schools to look into the types of social groups and activities necessary to accommodate the girls. Teachers will go through training to prepare them for the psychological and teaching adjustments necessary. "Any time you introduce a dramatic change into an existing structure, that causes uncertainties, and it causes a certain amount of tension and a certain amount of worry that is there just because of the changes," Clarke said. All of the teachers at La Salle have taught co-ed classes before, Clarke said. The Christian Brothers, which run La Salle, also own eight other high schools in California and Oregon. All eight either are co-ed or are considering it. "Christian Brothers prefer" co-ed schools "to single-sex schools because the kids fit better into their present generation, they are prepared better for life than just in a single-sex school, according to our experience," Clarke said. The decision by the Christian Brothers follows the announcement in early October that the Westlake School for girls on the Westside and the Harvard School for boys in North Hollywood, two prestigious private schools, will merge in the fall of 1991. Parents of Westlake students have protested the merger, citing research showing that single-sex education may be beneficial for girls. Proponents of the Harvard-Westlake merger, however, contend that single-sex education is out of date and th!t, if Harvard were to go co-ed on its own, Westlake might not be able to survive financially. The academic debate over the quality of a single-sex education as compared with a co-educational setting, however, has leaned towards the conclusion that, at least for girls, single-sex education is better. In the 1960s and 1970s, social and economic reasons forced some single-sex schools to close or go co-ed. Single-sex education was viewed as a barrier to the successful socialization of adolescents, said Valerie Lee, professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Lee's research, however, shows that in schools where students are of the same socioeconomic status, "single-sex schools seem to be advantageous to the women that attend them," and that for boys, "it doesn't seem to make much difference" whether they go to a co-ed or single-sex school. For both boys and girls, she said, "all of the statistically significant single-sex school effects were positive" and there were "few negative effects."
