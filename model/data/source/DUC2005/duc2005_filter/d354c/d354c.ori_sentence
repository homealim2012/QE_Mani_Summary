CRISTIANI ROLLS UP WIDE MARGIN AS HEAVY FIGHTING LIMITS VOTER TURNOUT.
As widespread fighting Sunday between the army and Marxist guerrillas plus continuing intimidation by the rebels held down voter participation Alfredo Cristiani the candidate for an ultra right wing anti American party swept to a stunning and easy presidential victory.
Based on unofficial computer projections Cristiani the head of the Nationalist Republican Alliance or Arena was headed for a triumph that would far surpass predictions that he would still need a runoff against the second place finisher to succeed President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
Cristiani a 42 year old graduate of Georgetown University in Washington D.
said he had 54 of the early count with projections indicating he could reach 75.
Salvadoran networks were projecting a 62 vote for Cristiani against 32 for Fidel Chavez Mena candidate of the incumbent Christian Democratic party.
Official results were not scheduled for release until this morning.
Christian Democrat leaders would not concede on the record but told reporters there seemed no way Cristiani would fall short of a majority thus voiding the need for a runoff.
The election was the most violent since 1982 when the guerrillas staged major attacks against voting stations throughout the country.
Two journalists were killed Sunday by government forces while a third died Saturday night after being shot by military troops.
At least 23 guerrillas and six soldiers also died in battles on Sunday defense ministry spokesmen said.
They said fighting took place in 12 of the country s 14 provinces.
Almost as stunning as Cristiani s first round victory was the poor showing of the Democratic Convergence a coalition of non Marxist socialist and other moderate leftist parties.
The convergence was expected to finish with a strong enough third to influence a runoff.
However the party was running fifth in the early returns.
Cristiani held a series of news conferences after the victory projections were released.
He appeared determined to fight the harsh image he and his party have saying the election campaign should be forgotten and the country should get on with "unifying the Salvadoran family.
" He had begun the day the clear favorite but most predictions and opinion polls indicated he would fall short of the majority needed for a conclusive victory.
The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front the umbrella organization for five guerrilla forces that have been trying to overthrow the government since 1980 had called for a boycott of Sunday s election and had sabotaged nearly all the nation s electric power and threatened to attack buses and other vehicles.
The guerrilla coalition known as the FMLN has boycotted all four elections held since 1982.
This year they offered to take part if the voting were postponed until September and other guarantees were given to ensure a free campaign.
However when negotiations with the government collapsed the guerrillas denounced the vote as a fraud carried out to promote U.
The rebels called on their followers and sympathizers to boycott the vote and warned all campaign officials and workers to quit or else be considered part of the guerrillas conflict with the military.
This position was seen as damaging to the candidacy of Guillermo Ungo a non Marxist socialist who although formally aligned with the FMLN entered the election campaign giving the country its first opportunity since 1977 to vote for a leftist candidate.
When the FMLN announced its boycott it promised not to attack any of the 243 voting stations.
On Sunday however the guerrillas menaced election officials and workers and carried out heavy combat operations against army forces in populated areas further reducing voter participation that was already diminished by the rebels earlier threats against road traffic.
Flashes of Gunfire With about 90 of the country without electricity or water the darkness of early morning was disturbed by flashes of gunfire and flares and the sound of bombs set off by guerrillas in attacks on army units on the edge of San Salvador and in provinces throughout the country.
Hard hit was Santa Ana El Salvador s second largest city which normally is free of guerrilla activity.
Berlin San Agustin and San Francisco Javier in Usulutan province.
Suchitoto in Cuscatlan province and Chinameca a town in San Miguel province.
Voting was delayed several hours in most of those cities and canceled in San Agustin and San Francisco Javier.
A two hour gun battle took place in the San Salvador suburb of San Ramon when guerrillas struck at army troops guarding a water plant.
At least one soldier was killed and another wounded in the fighting which pinned down journalists drawn to the sound of the gunfire.
2 million were expected to cast ballots even though voting is mandatory a requirement easily checked since every voter must dip a finger into a pot of indelible ink.
Fewer Voters Seen While there was an ebb and flow to the pace of the voting depending on the level of violence even some tranquil areas were notably lacking in voters.
For instance an election official in El Paraiso an area often hit by the guerrillas in Chalatenango province told reporters that he expected no more than 45 or 50 of the 4 500 registered voters to show up.
In places where there was no conflict people walked to polling places to make up for the lack of transportation some taking four hours to make the round trip.
In San Salvador one polling place in the center of town looked like the ticket window of a Super Bowl stadium with people having spent the night in order to vote early.
And despite regulations prohibiting the military from interfering with the voting soldiers searched all men as they waited for their ballots.
"People are scared " said Carlos Rodolfo Alvarado an election official.
It had been predicted that a lower turnout would benefit Cristiani.
Arena has a solid base of nearly 500 000 members who are considered far more organized and fervent in their support for their candidate than the Christian Democrats who are badly split and demoralized from charges of corruption and inefficiency leveled at their party.
Chances of Victory Go Up said one diplomat Throughout the campaign Cristiani tried to soften Arena s image of a party still tied to the right wing death squads and brutal military tactics of the early 1980s when the organization was founded by former army Maj.
D Aubuisson has been charged publicly by President Duarte with engineering the 1980 murder of Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero while former U.
Ambassador Robert White says the Arena founder plotted the assassination of at least one American ambassador.
Gerardo Le Chevalier Chavez Mena s campaign manager has likened El Salvador to the Weimar Republic of Germany in the years after World War I.
Cristiani who is a millionaire coffee grower denies that D Aubuisson had any death squad links and angrily denounces foreign journalists who say they have found evidence that the former army officer planned last year to restart the deaths squads under the cover of providing security for Arena s National Assembly members.
Cristiani also has suggested that Arena is now more moderate.
The Arena candidate has lambasted the United States for its past support of the Christian Democrats and still suggests that the American Embassy secretly prefers Chavez Mena.
officials indirectly acknowledge that the embassy in both the 1982 and 1984 elections not only preferred Duarte over D Aubuisson but also provided heavy financial aid and pressure to prevent an Arena victory.
Chavez Mena agrees with American Ambassador William G.
Walker that the United States has been neutral this time but he says that stance amounts to Cristiani is if not an enemy of Washington hardly a friend.
He has accused the United States of pushing El Salvador toward socialism by pressuring for land reform and supporting Duarte s nationalization of banks and export control boards particularly that of coffee.
He has promised to privatize the economy and roll back the already weak and largely ineffective land reform program.
May Step Up the War Cristiani has also pledged to step up the war against the guerrillas if they do not agree to a negotiated settlement soon.
Human rights observers say this means an increase in civilian deaths and human rights abuses since D Aubuisson and other Arena leaders have called for harsh action against guerrilla sympathizers.
The deaths of the three journalists Sunday are likely to increase pressure by liberals in the U.
Congress and elsewhere to reduce if not eliminate the huge American economic and military aid program to El Salvador now averaging 1.
Although the official American position is that the winner of a democratic election must be respected and judged on his policies many officials express caution about Arena and have warned Cristiani that Congress will cut back on aid if he is perceived as a "false face" covering real control of Arena by D Aubuisson.
This warning to Arena was voiced indirectly but publicly in February when Vice President Dan Quayle visited here and said any increase in human rights violations would result in reduced if not eliminated American aid.
We Want Democracy For his part the Arena candidate told reporters Sunday that the United States should mind its own business.
The deaths of the three journalists led immediately to a dispute over the causes.
Roberto Navas a 28 year old free lance photographer working for Reuters news agency was riding a motorcycle home from work about 9.
Saturday when he was shot to death by a soldier guarding a roadblock near an air force base on the outskirts of San Salvador.
A passenger on the motorcycle Luis Galdamez another free lance photographer said they had been waved through the roadblock and were approaching another soldier when they were shot from behind.
Navas was killed immediately and Galdamez was hospitalized with serious bullet wounds.
Army spokesmen said the two men had run two roadblocks and were shot after refusing to stop.
Car Allegedly Refused to Stop Another journalist Mauricio Pineda de Leon a television sound technician for a Salvadoran TV network was shot to death by a soldier Sunday morning near the eastern city of San Miguel.
The army contended that the car carrying Pineda de Leon refused to stop and was fired on after it ignored a warning shot.
The third slain journalist was Cornelio Lagrouw a cameraman for Dutch national television.
He and several other reporters and photographers were in the town of San Francisco Javier on Sunday morning after it had been captured by the FMLN.
They were caught in a crossfire when the army counterattacked and Lagrouw was killed by a bullet to the chest.
When his colleagues tried to remove Lagrouw s body an army helicopter fired on the road and prevented their leaving the area for several minutes they said.
and human rights groups have called for an immediate investigation into the deaths.

CBS ROTH FREED BACK ON CHINA FRONT LINES.
CBS correspondent Richard Roth was freed Sunday after nearly 20 hours in captivity in Beijing during which time he said he was kicked and punched by the Chinese troops who had arrested him and his cameraman.
His release and news reports came as the three major TV networks and CNN aired graphic photographs and videotape footage the latter flown out by couriers of the pre dawn carnage in Tian An Men Square where army troops late Saturday and early Sunday crushed the long student demonstration.
The networks first video footage of the bloodshed broadcast before dawn Sunday and later that morning included scenes of bloodied bodies lying on the ground a tent being crushed by a tank and dramatic shots on ABC of a stalled armored personnel carrier exploding after being set afire by student thrown Molotov cocktails.
Under martial law imposed May 20 live TV and taped video transmissions from Beijing are banned.
Network correspondents largely have ignored the taping prohibition however and have been flying their news footage from Beijing to Hong Kong Tokyo and other points.
They also have continued to file live telephone reports from Beijing.
In a phone conversation with CBS anchor Dan Rather that was broadcast live Sunday morning Roth said that he and cameraman Derek Williams "were well treated" following the initial encounter with Chinese troops the day before during another live phone call to CBS.
That report from a vantage point near Tian An Men Square abruptly halted amid sounds of a scuffle and Roth s cries of "oh no.
Williams and eight other Westerners including an unidentified Italian journalist whom Roth said had been badly beaten also were released Sunday with Roth a 17 year veteran with CBS News.
Roth s release came after CBS News President David Burke sought help from Secretary of State James Baker.

Roth said he suffered "a small cut" under one eye and a gash on his head when seized by a small group of Chinese troops shortly before dawn Saturday in Beijing.
He said he offered no resistance when the armed soldiers grabbed him.
He said the cut under his eye later was The troops held Roth and Williams a New Zealand national who was not hurt for about 40 minutes in the Great Hall of the People near the square Roth reported.
The troops later took Roth Williams and a Chinese speaking American music student who also had been arrested on a Jeep trip through the then empty Tian An Men Square to a military encampment at the Forbidden City enclosure in Beijing he said.
Roth described the scene as one that seemed "out of a movie " with torn and ripped tents that had housed the protesting students troops sitting around and several armored personnel carriers six to eight light tanks and truck drawn heavy artillery in the square.
Turned over to civilian authorities he reported adding that while the holding facility was uncomfortable his captors Others held with him included a couple from Long Island N.

Jose Antonio Zorrilla once head of Mexico s now defunct Federal Security Directorate was indicted for murder in the 1984 slaying of journalist Manuel Buendia.
Prosecutors contend that Zorrilla 47 masterminded the killing of the influential Excelsior newspaper columnist who was shot in the back in a Mexico City parking lot on May 30 1984.
In presenting its case the prosecution said Buendia was slain because Zorrilla feared the journalist would expose links to some of Mexico s major drug traffickers.
Zorrilla who has denied having any role in the murder did not enter a plea at the hearing.
At the same time an arrest warrant was issued for Buendia s alleged assassin but authorities refused to disclose the identity of the suspect.

EGYPTIAN OFFICIAL FIRED FOR ANTI EXTREMIST STAND.
Egypt s powerful interior minister was dismissed Friday after reportedly urging the violent elimination of Muslim extremists who represent one of the strongest challenges to the moderate government of President Hosni Mubarak.
Mubarak s dismissal of Zaki Badr the tough outspoken director of Egypt s internal security forces followed two days of controversy over remarks reported in opposition newspapers that Badr allegedly made at two recent rallies.
Badr reportedly said he wanted to kill Muslim fundamentalists who have opposed Egypt s moderate government and have urged the implementation of conservative Islamic laws and strict social controls.
Badr was quoted as saying apparently including in his remarks even members of the Muslim Brotherhood which holds several seats in Parliament.
His remarks reportedly were recorded on tape by the Socialist Labor Party newspaper Al Shaab.
Badr was said to have unleashed a stream of abuse at Egyptian journalists opposition politicians lawyers and Muslim scholars including some of his colleagues in the Cabinet calling them sons of dogs thieves homosexuals and cart drivers.
In other comments published by the Paris based newspaper Al Watan Al Arabi Badr said of the Islamic extremists Mubarak s decision to fire Badr follows months of controversy over the Interior Ministry s tough crackdown on fundamentalists in Egypt resulting in thousands of arrests tear gas assaults on mosques and reports by human rights organizations of political prisoners being tortured.
Last month Badr 63 survived what appeared to be an assassination attempt when a car bomb exploded just before he arrived at a police recreational facility.
The incident followed the arrest of 500 Muslim fundamentalists a week earlier in the southern province of Assiut a hotbed of Muslim extremism for years.
Opposition politicians for months have been calling for Mubarak to rein in the Interior Ministry which recently has detained large numbers of journalists writers and university professors based on allegations that they were Communists.
The arrests sparked outcries from human rights groups around the world.
Western diplomats here say that while it is not surprising that Mubarak dismissed the controversial minister it is widely believed that Mubarak quietly supported Badr s tough approach toward Islamic fundamentalists who many believe represent a growing threat to stability in Egypt as economic conditions steadily worsen.
Appointed to replace Badr was Mohammed Abdel Halim Moussa a career police officer whose approach has been more conciliatory than confrontational.

BRITAIN RECALLS IRAQ ENVOY AFTER REPORTER IS EXECUTED.
Britain recalled its ambassador to Iraq today after the government of President Saddam Hussein ignored international appeals and hanged a London based journalist accused of espionage.
Britain also suspended all ministerial visits and military training programs.
The decision to recall London s ambassador to Iraq Harold Walker came after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he was "shocked and repelled" by the execution and he could not remember any other recent case of such disregard for united world opinion.
Farzad Bazoft 31 was sentenced to death on Saturday by a military court that accused him of spying for Israel when he entered an unauthorized military complex north of Baghdad last September.
He was investigating for the Observer newspaper an explosion reported to have killed hundreds of people.
Officials said a British nurse Daphne Parish 52 who was accused of driving Bazoft to the restricted zone had been shifted to a central jail to begin her 15 year sentence also passed by the revolutionary tribunal.
Robin Kealy the British consul general who witnessed the execution inside a Baghdad prison told the BBC that Bazoft looked "hollow eyed and subdued" as he was led to the gallows.
British diplomats said Iraqi Information Minister Latif Nassif Jassim delivered the body to the British Embassy and said.
THE DEATH TOLL IS LEAPING UPWARD AMONG THOSE REPORTING ON THE BATTLES FOR DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
Sixty three journalists were killed on the job in 22 countries last year the highest toll since records have been kept.
And now with the execution in Iraq of Farzad Bazoft of the London Observer 1990 already has the makings of surpasssing it.
In the last three months journalists have been killed in El Salvador Brazil Romania and Turkey.
Bazoft met his gruesome death on the orders of President Saddam Hussein on an unproven charge of spying.
Only a week before an extraordinarily brave Turkish journalist Cetin Emec chief editor and columnist of the Istanbul daily Hurriyet was shot to death by marksmen as he left home for work.
In what turned out to be his last column Emec wrote of his fears of the resurgence of terrorism in Turkey and the role of Syria in promoting it.
He also argued that Damascus was behind the bombing of the Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland in December 1988.
(Among them was The Times Dial Torgerson who was ambushed while driving on the Honduras Nicaragua border.
The number arrested or detained has also shot up from a low of 72 in 1984 to 225 in 1989.
These are the carefully compiled figures of Freedom House in New York.
During the Vietnam War more journalists were killed (proportional to their numbers) than American soldiers.
A few years ago West German insurers gave the longevity of the average journalist as somewhere in the late 40s.
But something rather different without precedent is afoot today.
It is occuring in too many countries for there to be one catch all explanation.
What is happening I believe is a worldwide sea change in how journalists perceive their craft.
Over the last decade they have become more and more disrespectful of those who abuse their power whether they be governments or guerrilla movements.
Increasingly they insist on the hard questions particularly ones that challenge an authority s conduct if it appears to have no democratic base and abuses the rights of those with less influence.
This maturation of the journalistic mind is part of the harvest reaped after 30 years of civil and human rights agitation in the Western world.
That influence has moved like a wave through Western educated and Western oriented younger people all over the world.
Not least it has affected journalists who occupy that highly sensitive and fine tuned midway point between politics and literature and have always wanted to believe that the pen is mightier than the sword.
The post 1950s movement toward liberty and democracy has encouraged them to confront with growing confidence those who use power wealth or guns for ignoble ends.
But a price is paid for touching the nerve ends of those who have no compunction about being ruthless.
The morbidity figures seem to suggest that journalists have pushed the frontiers of free reporting so far that they have made themselves frighteningly vulnerable.
The determination to fight with the pen is certainly what drives the Colombian journalism fraternity which has made a greater sacrifice than any other national group.
19 journalists were murdered by the Colombian drug mafia last year 86 in the last decade.
Along with a number of judges and political leaders the journalists have taken the brunt of the drug lords effort to intimidate Colombian society into cowed submission.
Make no mistake about it the Colombian journalists are imbued first and foremost with a sense of mission not to save the bodies and souls of drug consumers in the United States although of course they would be glad to see that happen but to save their own precious institutions of democracy and justice.
Democracy too is what drove Violeta Barrios de Chamorro general director of the Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa to fight the totalitarianism of the Sandinistas.
And democracy is what drove a large number of journalists Chinese and foreign to cover the demonstrations and protests of Tian An Men Square last June with an intimacy and daring that was breathtaking.
By year s end at least 56 Chinese journalists including some of the most prominent had been arrested.
But there remains a strong underground of journalists active in China working by new day fax and old day samizdat to keep the cause of democracy burning.
Across much of the world the battle for democracy and human rights has reached a crescendo and journalists are on the cutting edge capturing and shaping the mood.
As the wave spreads in China again and in Africa and the Middle East journalists will be there too and there will be more casualties.
DEATH SQUADS TERRORISM BECOMES SRI LANKA SCANDAL.
After a yearlong reign of terror by government backed death squads that emptied villages of young men and littered Sri Lanka s beaches with corpses the fishermen of Moratuwa were hardly surprised when they spotted yet another body floating 250 yards offshore recently.
When the fishermen got the body to shore they knew that this was not just another anonymous suspect in the government s brutal counterinsurgency campaign.
It was Richard De Zoysa nationally known television newscaster and film actor who most recently had been writing exposes on the abuses of Sri Lanka s death squads.
Just that morning Sri Lankan radio had announced that a group of armed men some in police uniform had abducted the 31 year old journalist from his mother s home in the capital of Colombo the previous day.
And now the Indian Ocean fishermen recognized De Zoysa s body with two bullet wounds in the head as something that did not fit the pattern of their coastal killing ground.
In the weeks that have followed De Zoysa s murder in late February his case has mushroomed into a national scandal reaching to the highest levels of government.
Diplomats lawyers and even members of Colombo s powerful ruling elite now say his death has come to symbolize a terrifying legacy of death squads gone awry.
said Colombo attorney Batty Weerakoon who is representing De Zoysa s mother.
Just 10 days after De Zoysa s murder for example a death squad in another town near Colombo shot set aflame and killed 13 members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party the main opposition to President Ranasinghe Premadasa s ruling party.
Elsewhere local opposition leaders have been assassinated individually or have complained of persistent telephoned death threats.
Five human rights lawyers investigating the activities of hit squads or representing victims families have been murdered.
Already the De Zoysa murder has had a chilling effect on the media as well.
At least four journalists have fled the country under death threats and those who remain say they are consciously avoiding any subject critical of the government.
The most recent activity of the death squads emerges against a backdrop that is as gruesome as the present record.
In the southern regions of this island nation once so idyllic that Mark Twain a visitor in the 19th Century nicknamed it Serendip there are entire villages where only children and the elderly remain.
Many were summarily executed under continuing emergency laws that permit security forces to kill suspects without trial or identification.
Others remain in overflowing military jails where they re being held without charges or notification of their relatives.
At camps throughout the south where the grass roots insurgency by the People s Liberation Army began in earnest three years ago scores of mothers can still be seen pressing up against the barbed wire waiting for word of their sons husbands or fathers.
The leftist insurgents also contributed heavily to the horror.
Before their leader Rohana Wijeweera and his top lieutenants were captured and quickly executed by security forces late last year guerrilla units routinely bound suspected government informants in village clearings and beheaded them as villagers were forced to watch.
They forced shopkeepers bus drivers and rickshaw pullers to observe general strikes by torturing and killing those who refused to comply often paralyzing the nation and its economy.
Until the government unleashed its death squads a year ago most analysts agreed that the insurgents were on the verge of taking power by force.
The death toll on both sides in the past year alone is staggering.
The most conservative estimate by diplomatic observers is 8 000 in a nation of just 15 million.
Political analyst Neelan Tiruchelvam borrowing a quote from Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel said.
It was in this context that the group of heavily armed men came to Manorani Saravanamuttu s modest Colombo home and demanded her son De Zoysa just after 3 a.
Despite his relative youth De Zoysa a veteran journalist knew all the top Sri Lankan politicians personally even President Premadasa.
He was employed full time as a correspondent of the Rome based Inter Press Service an international news agency focused on a Third World market.
But he was also an outspoken and respected actor and a fixture in Colombo s artistic community.
As a journalist De Zoysa had written Inter Press dispatches highly critical of the death squads among them an article last August entitled But he also had worked on documentary films favorable to the government and friends now say they believe it was De Zoysa s ties to the theater world as much as his journalistic work that made him a target for death.
The word was out that De Zoysa had helped produce a satirical play that was savagely critical of Premadasa who has been so sensitive to personal criticism that he has barred at least two foreign journalists from Sri Lanka simply for writing about his low caste roots.
The controversial play was called But the curtain never went up.
The night before its February debut producer Lakshman Perera an openly critical member of Premadasa s ruling party disappeared and is now believed to have been murdered.
It was the next morning that the armed men appeared at De Zoysa s mother s front door demanding to see her son.
"I m not a fool " Saravanamuttu a prominent physician and daughter of a former Sri Lankan diplomat told The Times in an interview this week.
(One) man was in full police uniform but I demanded to see some identification.
I had no choice and minutes later they took Richard away.
They just want to cover this whole thing up "Weerakoon said.
I m just not going to give this up without a fight no matter where it leads.
There are thousands of other mothers out there who just don t know who are still simply sitting there and waiting.
THE EX SECURITY CHIEF AT CALIENTE RACETRACK CAPTURED IN L.
IS BACK IN MEXICO TO FACE CHARGES IN THE SLAYING OF THE COLUMNIST KNOWN AS EL GATO.

Vera went to the station to meet a friend according to a statement by the Los Angeles Police Department which set up surveillance at the site.
The 38 year old Vera a former police officer in Mexico City was in the United States illegally and was consequently turned over to U.
Mexico border where he was turned over to state police agents and jailed in Tijuana.
The arrest culminates two years of doubt and intrigue surrounding the slaying which became a heated political issue in Baja California testing the Mexican government s stated commitment to a free press.
Felix was one of two dozen journalists killed in the six year term of former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid.
Most of the slayings remain unsolved according to Mexican journalism groups.
Felix 47 was killed on April 20 1988 as he drove to work down a rain slicked street in Tijuana.
A vehicle blocked his path and an assassin pumped two rounds from a 12 gauge shotgun through the driver s window of his car.
The assailants had observed his path to and from work and waited for him at the assassination spot investigators said.
Felix s killing sparked anti government protests and large scale mourning in Tijuana his adopted city.
The perception that authorities were covering up Felix s slaying was widely credited with contributing to the decisive electoral victory last year of opposition Gov.
Ernesto Ruffo Appel the first ever opposition governor in modern Mexico.
Jesus Blancornelas Felix s longtime colleague and co worker after news of Vera s arrest.
he added referring to the upcoming court proceedings against Vera.
Although grateful for Vera s arrest Blancornelas said during a Wednesday night press conference that he believes the masterminds of the killing are still at large.
He voiced the hope that Vera s arrest will finally resolve the mystery surrounding his colleague s death.
Blancornelas and Felix founded the muckraking weekly Zeta in which Felix s pointed barbs appeared in a must read column called Un Poco de Algo (A Little of Something).
Felix using a telltale combination of puns double meanings crude words and other verbal stunts regularly took shots at a wide range of public officials in Baja.
His titillating gossipy missives were savored by the powerful and powerless alike.
For the past two years Blancornelas probably the most prominent journalist in Tijuana has repeatedly used his publication to demand a thorough investigation into his colleague s killing.
He has reprinted old columns by Felix and featured full page black bordered advertisements asking three successive Baja California governors what they planned to do with the case.
The weekly Zeta under Blancornelas direction has pointed its finger directly at Jorge Hank Rhon the president of the Caliente Racetrack who employed Vera.
Vera was also the longtime personal bodyguard for Hank who is the scion of a wealthy and influential Mexico City family.
Hank the race track owner was an acquaintance of the slain journalist but toward the end of the journalist s life Hank emerged as a frequent target in Felix s column.
Hank has repeatedly denied any involvement in the case.
His father Jorge Hank Gonzalez former mayor of Mexico City and now Mexico s minister of agriculture and water resources a cabinet level post has also publicly denied that his son played any role in the slaying or that any cover up was perpetuated to protect his son.
Ruffo held a press conference in the state capital of Mexicali to announce the arrest.
During the campaign Ruffo standard bearer of Mexico s opposition National Action Party had vowed to pursue the case and clear up the unsolved slaying a promise that he repeated Wednesday.
Vera who authorities said was living in El Monte east of Los Angeles was arrested without incident.
He had been sought since the killing and sightings of Vera had been reported everywhere from San Diego to Mexico City.
Vera appeared before Baja California State Judge Miguel Angel Barud on Wednesday and at a preliminary hearing denied the charges against him.
The judge has 72 hours to determine whether there is sufficient proof to retain Vera in custody something that is considered a virtual certainty considering the wealth of evidence garnered during the two years since an arrest order was issued for Vera.
Vera could face up to 30 years in jail on the murder charge.
The suspect sporting a beard was led into the courtroom in handcuffs under tight security.
Victoriano Medina Moreno a former security guard at the race track was convicted last August of being the triggerman in the slaying.
However Blancornelas the slain columnist s longtime colleague has argued in print that Vera was the actual triggerman and that Medina only drove the getaway vehicle.
Blancornelas and other journalists have said that Medina although sharing responsibility was being offered up as a scapegoat for the entire murder scheme an allegation denied by Baja authorities.
Medina himself contended that he was tortured into making a confession.
Mexican authorities never presented an adequate explanation as to why they believe Vera and Medina killed Felix.
Officials said one of his columns cost Medina his former job but Felix s former colleagues said neither Medina s or Vera s names ever appeared in any of Felix s columns.
THE UPFRONT ISSUE NOW IS GETTING EVERYONE S PRISONERS EXCHANGED.
The best that can be said about the release of American hostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed is that their return marked only the beginning of the beginning for the others still in captivity not the beginning of the end.
What appears to be happening is a kind of cautious groping for a process of politically "safe" accommodation a kind of face saving "uncompromising" compromise that all parties will be able to claim never happened.
The result of the Polhill Reed stage one release process was a significant tactical draw.
Although it was no win for everyone (except the Polhill and Reed families) it nevertheless was no loss too.
When lives are in peril this can be considered if not progress at least a gain.
The beginning of the next stage in the release process appears to be a further testing of each party s current intentions and attitudes in relation to one of the core issues of the long hostage ordeal exchanging prisoners.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani s complaint that Washington s lukewarm thanks for Tehran s role in the release of Polhill and Reed was "inadequate and unwise" drew a tactful response from President Bush.
He implied a parallel between our national pain and Iran s by expressing some empathy for Iran s periodic expressions of concern about the fate of three Iranian diplomats and their driver who disappeared in Christian East Beirut on July 4 1982 and its additional oft expressed concern for the fate of 400 to 500 Lebanese and Palestinians being held hostage by Israel.
By continuing to dwell on their own missing officials and Israel s hostages Iran has been sending a message for quite some time that Westerners are not the only kidnap victims in Lebanon and that justice requires that Muslim sensibilities in this respect need also to be taken into account.
President Bush pledged that the United States would try to be of assistance to Iran so long as this was not His comment was similar to those he voiced nearly a year ago in response to Israel s kidnaping of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid the south Lebanese Shiite leader linked to Hezbollah.
At that time the President appealed to And after Reed s release the White House its no deal policy for American hostages notwithstanding said that it would not object to Israel trading its Lebanese and Palestinian hostages for three Israeli servicemen captured in Lebanon in 1986.
Other rewards for "helping out" speeding up the return of Iranian frozen assets compensating Iran for undelivered military equipment and normalizing diplomatic and trade relations with both Iran and Syria will undoubtedly take place in time but not until all our hostages have come home and probably not until both Iran and Syria get themselves off the State Department s list of nations involved with terrorism.
The nation s bitter Iran Contra experience with foolhardy upfront rewards without ironclad guarantees that the hostages would be freed will prevent that from happening again.
Iran s upbeat announcement Wednesday that progress had been made at the Iran U.
Claims Tribunal in The Hague is an indication that upfront material compensation and rewards are no longer the major issues they once seemed to be.
Iran seems to be satisfied that both can be expected in an appropriate period of time after all the hostages come home.
So now the upfront issue is getting everyone s hostages and prisoners exchanged.
The most consistent demand of the Lebanese captors has been for the return of Arab prisoners and hostages.
If no more American hostages are taken to replace Polhill and Reed we can take this as a signal that the captors are watching to see if Washington will pressure Israel to free the hostages it seized in Lebanon and if Kuwait will find a way to release 15 Shiite Muslims convicted of terrorism in December 1983.
It should not really be surprising that the fate of the American and perhaps other Western hostages now seems to be depending on what Israel and its Lebanese adversaries are ready and willing to do about their hostage situation.
There always has been a direct Israeli connection to the plight of the American hostages.
It was Washington s essentially uncritical support of Israel s invasion of Lebanon (and then our eventual violent intrusion into Lebanon s civil war mostly on Israel s behalf) that turned a fairly high Lebanese regard for Americans into deadly hatred.
Now there is a growing insistence in the United States that because the Israelis played a major role in getting us into this mess they d better help get us out with the lives of our six remaining hostage citizens intact.
TWO REPORTERS IN TROUBLED PAKISTAN PROVINCE KILLED.
Ethnic clashes spread Saturday to rural areas of Sind province as motorcycle riding gunmen shot and killed two Pakistani journalists minutes after the pair had completed reports about the violence that has turned Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto s home province into a battleground.
No one claimed responsibility for the slayings of Ahmed Khan Kamal a correspondent for Pakistan Press International a small privately owned news agency and Muthair Naqpit with Nawa i Waqt a leading Urdu language daily.
The army which took control of the southern province Friday as the death toll from mounting violence reached nearly 400 said it needs more troops to maintain order.
The violence in Sind which erupted May 15 was sparked by differences between the native Sindis and Mohajirs descendants of Muslims who migrated from India when the subcontinent was divided in 1947.
Sindis accuse the better educated Mohajirs of taking the best jobs and most valuable land.
The Chinese government warned foreign correspondents Tuesday to cease "illegal" news coverage after journalists reported two nights of protests by Beijing University students.
Several foreign journalists have been beaten kicked harassed and dispersed at gunpoint by police recently while attempting to cover the campus protests and activities around Tian An Men Square in the heart of the city.
The anti government protests were held to commemorate the anniversary of the army s crackdown on last year s student led democracy movement.
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing lodged a protest with the government Tuesday objecting to of foreign journalists by paramilitary and plainclothes security police.
Jim Munson president of the Correspondents Club and a reporter for Canadian television was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday even before the correspondents protest could be delivered.
A Foreign Ministry official told Munson that and that he will be held responsible for its consequences.
The official charged that some journalists violated city regulations by entering university campuses without formally applying to do so.
He said "a small number" of foreign journalists have connections with Chinese engaged in illegal activities and "even colluded with them.
" Munson said he told the official that the Correspondents Club was protesting the physical abuse and detention of journalists who were The Correspondents Club letter cited five cases of rough treatment of foreign journalists.
Armed paramilitary police struck Los Angeles Times correspondent David Holley and beat his wife Fumiyo with rifle butts outside the Beijing University campus.
Plainclothes police kicked Reuters photographer Richard Ellis in the head and smashed his camera.
A policeman severely beat West German television correspondent Gisela Mahlmann Hermann of ZDF with a truncheon.
ABC correspondents Todd Carrel and Masaaki Serita Ogushi were assaulted and detained.
CBS cameraman Bradley Simpson was physically mistreated and pieces of his equipment were seized.
BEIJING CONTINUES TO ASSAULT THE SPIRIT OF PRESS INDEPENDENCE.
SINCE LAST JUNE MANY CHINESE JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN PURGED JAILED OR HUMILIATINGLY COMPROMISED.
He was young good looking in an austere way and spoke excellent British inflected English not surprising given that he listens to the BBC English language service every day in Beijing (that is when his government doesn t have it jammed).
He wore exactly the intent searching expression we had seen so often on the faces of the Chinese student demonstrations on television a year ago.
Yet his words a confession that could have been taken from "Darkness at Noon" seemed to spring out of a unreconstructed past.
he explained He has seen the light the young journalist says and has repudiated the Democracy Movement and his involvement in it.
when he goes back to China he will be formally investigated by the Communist Party but he feels he has "nothing to fear.
" The young man s humiliating compromise is clearly one that is necessary now for any Chinese journalist who wishes to continue in the profession.
Liu Binyan China s most famous journalist in exile and a victim of many purges himself captures the sense of moment when he quotes the proverb According to Liu in the wake of the past year s crackdown on the Democracy Movement in China journalists have suffered more sweeping and lasting retaliation that any other category of intellectuals.
The Committee to Protect Journalists latest reckoning holds that 20 Chinese journalists have been arrested since June 1989.
Of these only one Dai Qing (an offspring of Communist Party elite) was reported to be among the 211 detainees released by the government in mid May.
The other 19 including Song Yuchuan and Wu Xuecan of the People s Daily and Xu Xiaowei and Zhang Weiguo of the Shanghai World Economic Herald are presumed to remain in detention.
Scores of others who have escaped imprisonment have lost the right to work as journalists.
At the country s leading newspaper the People s Daily the Communist Party s mouthpiece about 100 journalists have been driven out including the editor in chief the director and almost all middle ranking editors and department heads.
Most of those removed were placed under house arrest and obliged to write self criticisms.
they were replaced by editors from the army news paper and editors shipped in from provincial party papers untainted by first hand knowledge of the massacre.
China s most prestigious independent publication the World Economic Herald has been closed.
The intense young man I met like the vast majority of Chinese journalists will remain at their publications however dead in spirit.
The party "investigation"of his activities will probably beginwith small group meetings in which he will have to pronounce and sign a confession of his "errors.
" If he is a party member he will also be obliged to write a letter of self criticism or three or four if the first is too weak.
No doubt at least part of his speech to me was directed at his Chinese colleagues in the room who might be reporting back to Beijing.
With the ground breaking publications and leading talents of the Chinese media silenced or obliged to recant the readership encounters a press whose familiar hallmarks are conformity and acquiescence to Communist Party policy.
human rights violations military abuses and the corrupt activities of high ranking party cadres and their children.
For a brief time open discussion of these issues galvanized Chinese journalism but they have disappeared from China s news pages again.
But even more distressing is the number of journalists who have disappeared into China s jails as political prisoners many of them because of their profound commitment to freedom of expression a concept Americans regard as a basic principle.
Unfortunately one was missed last month when the Bush Administration renewed China s most favored nation trade status.
Many Chinese including Liu Binyan feel it would be a mistake to revoke it entirely.
But Liu believes that MFN or similar instruments could have human rights conditions attached such as the release of political prisoners.
Such a measure would leave China open to positive foreign cultural and trade influences while still sending a message to Beijing that all is not forgiven or forgotten.
PRESIDENT SALINAS HIMSELF NEEDS TO MONITOR THIS SITUATION.
Mexico is a nation not normally associated with official brutality found in places like El Salvador.
This is why the recent report on rights violations in Mexico by the respected human rights organization Americas Watch is all the more noteworthy.
The report merits the personal attention of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Americas Watch concludes that in their zeal to combat drugs and limit political dissent some Mexican police officials have "institutionalized" the practice of torturing prisoners.
The report also noted that between 1970 and 1988 51 Mexican journalists were killed pursuing news stories involving official corruption or drug trafficking.
In a climate like that the recent threats against Jorge Castaneda a professor at Mexico s national university and a regular contributor to The Times must be regarded seriously.
Castaneda s articles have usually been critical of the Salinas government.
His view on Mexican politics while not often shared by this editorial page nonetheless deserve a wide audience.
It may be that some Mexicans would rather those views weren t widely heard which may have been why four armed men stopped Castaneda s secretary on a Mexico City street last week questioned her about him and his family and told her It is not surprising that Salinas defended Castaneda when the incident was made public saying such a blatant effort to stifle dissent is "unacceptable.
" In its report Americas Watch credited Salinas with trying to improve the climate in Mexico by resurrecting a human rights office in the federal government and naming a national commission to oversee its work.
But the report warns that Salinas must not opt for One way for Salinas to prove he won t is to find and discipline the thugs who threatened Castaneda.
MEDELLIN DRUG TRAFFICKERS RESUME TERROR CAMPAIGN.
THREE HOSTAGES ARE TAKEN TO BACK AMNESTY DEMANDS.
THE GOVERNMENT DECLINES TO CONFIRM THAT THE NARCOTICS CARTEL IS RESPONSIBLE.
The Colombian government refused Friday to acknowledge publicly what the local news media are calling a fact.
Medellin drug traffickers have resumed their terrorist campaign by seizing at least three hostages.
A statement sent to newspapers radio and television stations late Thursday confirmed that traffickers had kidnaped two leading journalists and the sister of Colombia s ambassador to Italy.
The statement said the hostages would be freed only when the government of President Cesar Gaviria agrees to grant drug traffickers amnesty.
Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo Angel refused to discuss the demands at a Friday news conference.
He said that the government had still not determined whether traffickers of the so called Medellin cartel were behind the recent kidnapings.
But a senior journalist at El Tiempo Colombia s leading newspaper said government officials had privately acknowledged the cartel s responsibility for Wednesday s kidnaping of the daily s managing editor Francisco Santos.
An armed band abducted Santos the 28 year old son of El Tiempo s publisher Wednesday after forcing his car to the side of the road and killing his chauffeur.
El Tiempo has reported that it received several calls from a man identified as Carlos Jimenez who represented the cartel.
The caller said traffickers had kidnaped Santos and several other Colombians.
the El Tiempo source said while asking not to be identified.
Escobar is the cartel s leader accused of masterminding terrorist attacks that have killed more than 500 people since August 1989.
Both the caller and the cartel statement said traffickers are also holding Diana Turbay de Uribe the editor of a news magazine and daughter of former Colombian president Julio Cesar Turbay.
Turbay de Uribe is missing along with five other journalists who had been working with her.
Another Bogota newspaper La Prensa reported Friday that the cartel is planning to release the other five journalists including a West German.
In its statement the cartel also claimed responsibility for Wednesday s kidnaping of Marina Montoya the sister of Colombia s ambassador to Italy.
Both the phone calls to El Tiempo and the cartel statement give further evidence that traffickers have ended a two month old cease fire in their terrorist campaign.
Traffickers said in July that they were suspending bombings and assassinations to show their desire for peace.
The move was intended to pressure Gaviria who took office Aug.
7 to call off the government s anti drug crackdown which began in 1989.
As part of the campaign Gaviria s predecessor Virgilio Barco Vargas had decreed new anti drug measures including the extradition of trafficking suspects to the United States.
Gaviria pledged to maintain the pressure on the cartel but he soon offered traffickers incentives for maintaining their truce and turning themselves in.
A recent presidential order said that surrendering drug suspects would be tried at home rather than extradited to the United States.
It also offered traffickers reduced prison sentences in exchange for their cooperation.
Some analysts say the cartel viewing Gaviria s peace overture as inadequate decided to take hostages to force negotiations.
The source added that Gaviria s efforts to persuade traffickers to surrender had failed.
He repeated what the Medellin cartel representative had told the paper Gaviria has yet to acknowledge that the cartel is restarting its terrorist campaign.
But the president said in a television interview broadcast Thursday that the government miight be willing to "revise the extradition mechanism" if traffickers refrain from carrying out new terrorist attacks.
25 VIETNAMESE JOURNALISTS IN COUNTY DENOUNCE KILLING OF COLUMNIST WIFE.
The slaying of a controversial Vietnamese American magazine columnist and his wife in Virginia prompted Vietnamese language newspaper publishers in Little Saigon on Monday to denounce what one editor called "terrorism against newsmen.
" Triet Le 61 is the ninth Vietnamese emigre journalist to be attacked or killed since 1980.
The victims include a Garden Grove publisher who died in an arson fire in 1987.
Le and his wife Tuyet Thi Dang Tran 52 were found dead of gunshot wounds in the driveway of their home in Baileys Crossroads Va.
Saturday a Fairfax County police spokesman said.
Police would not comment on a possible motive Monday and had made no arrests.
Nguyen editor in chief of the Westminster based weekly magazine Dieu Hau or The Eagle.
About 25 Vietnamese publishers editors and other journalists signed a statement Monday night denouncing terrorism threats and killing of writers regardless of the motivation.
authorities to investigate assassinations of four newsmen and to take steps to protect writers in the future.
Two of Le s children by a previous marriage live in Orange County and were headed back to Virginia for their father s funeral which is scheduled Thursday said Len Phuong who worked with Le at Van Nghe Tien Phong magazine in Arlington Va.
The bimonthly magazine has a staff of five and an international circulation of 14 000 Phuong said.
Although Le enjoyed a wide following he had been criticized for sensationalism and for personal attacks on a number of Vietnamese political figures community leaders and other prominent exiles.
He was also the subject of a libel suit Phuong confirmed.
Others who knew Le described him Monday as a fiercely anti communist muckraker who reported some say fabricated everything from political intrigue to corruption to adultery.
Though he wrote under the pen name Tu Rua his real name was well known and he had accumulated a long list of personal and political enemies they said.
said Yen Ngoc Do editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily News in Westminster who said he himself was once tongue lashed in print by Le.
said another prominent emigre whom Le had accused in print of pro communist leanings.
Ten years ago the magazine s publisher Nguyen Thanh Hoang was the target of an arson attack that damaged his home and car.
Two years later Hoang s name appeared with several others on the "hit list" of a Vietnamese extremist organization.
Last November a page designer for the magazine Nhan Trong Do was found shot to death outside his home.
Vietnamese extremist groups have claimed responsibility for a number of previous attacks on newspaper editors and publishers whom they accused of communist leanings including the 1987 arson death of Garden Grove publisher Tap Van Pham.
The Vietnamese Party to Exterminate the Communists and Restore the Nation claimed responsibility for the attack which investigators believe was motivated by Pham s acceptance of advertisements that were perceived by some as pro communist.
In 1988 the FBI announced an investigation into political violence in the Vietnamese exile community after reports of political motives in attacks around the nation.
Officer Bill Coulter spokesman for Fairfax County police would not comment Monday on whether any group had claimed responsibility for the Le killings nor would he say whether the FBI had been asked to investigate.
An FBI spokesman in Santa Ana Jim Neilson declined to say whether the 1988 FBI investigation is still active.
No indictments have been made and the majority of the attacks have gone unsolved.
Phuong said Le had received numerous death threats during his 13 year career as have many other Vietnamese American writers editors and publishers.
said Bruce Hoffman a domestic terrorism expert with the Rand Corp.
As in the Cuban Armenian Filipino and Taiwanese exile communities Hoffman said the attackers could be motivated by politics or by a personal vendetta or could use one to mask the other.

COLOMBIA REBELS REPORTEDLY SEIZE 3 AMERICANS.
Leftist guerrillas were blamed Monday for the abduction on Sunday of five petroleum engineers including three American citizens working in Colombia.
The Medellin cocaine cartel meanwhile freed a kidnaped journalist after using him and at least nine other hostages to try to pressure the government into abandoning its anti drug fight.
The state oil company Ecopetrol said that two men and a woman saying they belonged to the National Liberation Army or ELN abducted three U.
petroleum engineers and two of their Colombian colleagues near the northern town of Tibu.
The group released one of the Colombians and told him to carry news of the abductions to officials William Giraldo an Ecopetrol spokesman said.
He identified the three Americans as Robert Hogan Larry Sams and John Bagbey and said they are employed by an Oklahoma mining company under contract to Ecopetrol.
The official added that Ecopetrol had not established the motive for the kidnapings.
The ELN has terrorized the petroleum industry for years to try to pressure the government into nationalizing it.
A statement from "the Extraditables " as the Medellin drug bosses call themselves said they were releasing the journalist Juan Vitta who is about 60 because he was suffering heart pains.
Vitta s freedom came just four days after the Medellin traffickers offered to surrender in exchange for government concessions.
Cartel members demanded that authorities protect their safety prevent their extradition and drop a demand that they confess their crimes.
Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo responded by repeating that the government would respect the rights of surrendering traffickers and prohibit their extraditions.
But he insisted that drug suspects confess at least one of their offenses.
Giraldo and other officials called on the cartel to release its hostages as proof of its desire for peace.
Hours after gaining his freedom Vitta also called for the release of six other journalists still held by Medellin drug bosses.
he said in a live radio interview after flying to Bogota from Medellin where he was freed.
Vitta said his captors had driven him all night in a black four wheel drive vehicle before dropping him off in Medellin.
Vitta editor of the weekly news magazine Hoy por Hoy had been held for 86 days when he was freed.
The freed hostage said he was treated well by his captors but added that he and the other six journalists were kept in separate rooms and he could not vouch for the condition of the others.
FT 26 APR 91 Two FT journalists die in Kuwait car blaze.
TWO Financial Times journalists David Thomas Natural Resources Editor and Alan Harper staff photographer died on Wednesday when their car was engulfed by flames in the southern oilfields of Kuwait.
Three other people believed to be oilfield workers travelling in two trucks also died in the incident.
The road from the Burgan oilfields north to Al Ahmadi is a public highway.
It runs through some of the most fiercely blazing oil wells lit by retreating Iraqi troops in late February.
At the point where the accident occurred the fires are particularly close to the road.
Pools of oil regularly form near the road sometimes creating slicks on the highway.
The two journalists were part of an FT team working in Kuwait on a major project for the newspaper covering the reconstruction of the country after the Iraqi invasion.
David and Alan represented the best qualities of the FT they were full of integrity commitment and flair.
This is a terrible loss for their families and friends and for the newspaper.
Obituaries Page 12 A feature by David Thomas appears on Page 23.
A FEW years ago when I used to cover Opec conferences for the Financial Times a bizarre event took place at one of the Geneva price fixing meetings of the cartel.
We the journalists said we would not attend the opening press conference a threat which threw into confusion the bureaucrats who ran the show.
They were aware that the absence of notebooks and cameras at the event would make them very unpopular with their political masters whose vanity was legion.
This dire threat was issued because one of our number Youssef Ibrahim of the Wall Street Journal had been refused accreditation to that Opec conference.
Ibrahim had written a front page piece which among other things detailed with scrupulous accuracy the rates charged not just by the oil producers but also by the international hookers who in many cases employed by some of the less well known oil trading companies flew in to offer their personal services to the delegations from the Arab world and elsewhere.
Before you become horrified I should point out that these were the days of the Dollars 30 barrel of oil and one high fixed price provokes another.
Anyway the sheikhs and emirs were not amused by these revelations and were particularly furious that a fellow Arab should have let the home side down by revealing the seamy side of Opec.
And after some debate we his colleagues said between teeth grinding with jealousy at Youssef s excellent cover story none of us will attend your oil price fixing opening ceremony.
After some arguments in camera the Arabs let their brother back into the fold and we duly followed.
Later that day I remember being hailed by an executive of a very well known oil company a man who once had the distinction and courage to deliver a suitcase full of banknotes to the kidnappers of one of his colleagues and who was therefore greatly admired by all the journalists.
This man was much amused by the episode.
one of your deadly rivals is blackballed and instead of rejoicing at his misfortune and exploiting it you stand by him.
I can assure you he said that if my company was booted out of an oil province our rivals would not hesitate to make the most of our misfortune however unfairly we might have been treated.
(This of course explains why Opec beat the western oil companies but that is another story.
) I was startled by his remarks simply because I had never heard anyone praise journalists before nor have I ever since.
This episode came to my mind yesterday morning when reading in the FT of the deaths of two FT journalists Alan Harper a staff photographer and David Thomas natural resources editor whose car was engulfed by flames on a road in the oilfields of southern Kuwait on Wednesday.
In opinion polls journalists regularly come bottom of the list of most admired people.
But I am old fashioned enough to regard the profession as an admirable one and those who exemplify its highest quality the disinterested seeking out of the truth I regard with as much respect as I do the most honoured and begonged public servant.
David Thomas whom I knew slightly was of that category of writer.
What the journalists at the Opec conference a few years ago were saying is that they would put their own career interests and expediency behind a greater ideal which was that the truth however unappealing it or its purveyor is should not be censored.
David Thomas s last piece a feature on the nuclear industry five years after the Chernobyl disaster makes the point.
We would all have been better off if five years ago journalists had been able to tell the truth about that incident rather than be dictated to by scarcely disinterested nuclear scientists over here and Soviet politicians over there.
I am sorry if this sounds merely sentimental but David Thomas was an honourable exponent of an honourable profession and his death should be as much a matter of public grieving as that of any British soldier doing his duty in the Gulf.
FT 08 APR 92 Mexico to privatise two TV stations.
THE Mexican government has taken a small step towards reducing its grip over the national media by announcing it will sell off two television stations and the newspaper El Nacional.
Channels 7 and 13 have a tiny market share but they offer national penetration and the ability to compete with Mexico s television giant Televisa which has about 90 per cent of the Mexican television market.
Grupo Vargas with more than 100 000 subscribers to its pay as you view Multivison channel is likely to be one of the strongest bidders given that Televisa has been ruled out of the auction.
El Nacional funded and owned by the government closely follows the official line in editorials although of late reporting has become more objective and readership has increased.
The newspaper does not make money and in the absence of a buyer the government may retain it.
Even if it is sold the government s more indirect influence over the press will continue.
Almost all Mexican newspapers depend on government advertising or subsidies to make money and many journalists rely on a monthly embute (a stipend) from the department they cover to boost their miserable wages.
The result is self censorship and occasionally more direct government control.
It is an arrangement difficult to change since it suits both the newspaper owners and the government.
Independent newspapers and magazines have been flourishing attracting more readers and advertisers but in the provinces independent journalism can be highly dangerous.
During the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari 17 journalists have been killed according to PEN International usually for upsetting local policeman drug dealers or caciques (local strongmen).
FT 05 JUN 92 Foreign press sparks fury over Tiananmen Square.
THE CHINESE government in marked contrast to its stated policy of opening to the outside world has stepped up interference in the work of foreign journalists in Beijing.
Mr James Miles Beijing correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation has been banned from reporting while his journalist s pass is being held by the authorities.
Mr Miles was detained for five hours on April 30 after covering a protest by European MPs in Tiananmen Square.
The Japanese and German governments lodged protests with the Chinese foreign ministry over the beating and detention of reporters on Wednesday.
France has said the treatment was unacceptable.
Reporters from TBS television of Japan DPA news agency of Germany and ABC News of the US were detained for three hours as they attempted to report from the square on the eve of the third anniversary yesterday of the bloody crackdown on pro democracy campaigners in which hundreds were killed.
An ABC correspondent Mr Todd Carrel and a Japanese cameraman Mr Atsushi Yamagiwa were beaten up.
The Chinese foreign ministry justified use of force because reporters had broken the law.
FT 14 AUG 92 UN agrees force as last resort in Bosnia aid effort.
THE United Nations Security Council last night authorised the use of force as a last resort to ensure relief supplies get through to the beleaguered population of Bosnia Hercegovina.
The resolution was passed as western governments cautiously backed further away from military involvement in the former Yugoslav republic.
They hope the threat alone will clear obstacles to relief convoys.
Welcoming the UN vote President George Bush said he hoped to step up the Bosnian relief effort in co operation with allied nations the UN and aid agencies.
He called on Serbia and Croatia to give their full support.
The resolution sponsored by the US Britain France Belgium and Russia authorises all measures necessary to ensure delivery of humanitarian aid.
It does not spell out what kind of force could be used or by whom.
It was adopted by 12 votes to none with China India and Zimbabwe abstaining.
The council unanimously adopted a second resolution demanding unimpeded access for the Red Cross to detention camps in Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics.
Reacting to mounting concern about atrocities it warned that individuals violating human rights would be held responsible for their actions.
Sir David Hannay Britain s ambassador to the UN stressed that the Security Council was not prescribing the use of force.
It is a resolution which is authorising (force) as a last resort he said.
Despite the UN vote several European governments were yesterday united in their determination to resist being drawn into military involvement in the tangled ethnic conflict between Serbs Croats and Moslems in the former Yugoslavia.
President Francois Mitterrand of France said a military campaign would be a fearsome effort.
He said adding war to war would not solve anything.
The Italian defence minister Mr Salvo Ando warned the west not to get sucked into a long guerrilla war.
In Britain Mr George Robertson the Labour party s foreign affairs spokesman cautioned against military involvement.
But he said the British government cannot simply hang around waiting for UN resolutions action to force Serbia to the peace table is urgently required.
Mr Muhamed Sacirbey Bosnia s ambassador to the UN protested that the UN was not going far enough.
The envoy who sought but was denied an opportunity to address the Security Council strongly criticised what he termed a Band Aid approach to the turmoil in his republic.
I am afraid that this approach may end up with the patient on the operating table ostensibly to help him but that he may then be dismembered he said.
Mr Sacirbey also complained that there was an attempt being made to deal with the situation in a way that did not fully acknowledge Bosnia s sovereign status as an independent member of the UN.
The real issue was Bosnia s right to self defence and how to exercise this along with ensuring that relief aid was delivered he said.
UN diplomats said that any use of force aimed at protecting humanitarian aid convoys in Bosnia would be carried out under the auspices of the UN which already has a peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia.
Diplomats said the UN resolution authorising force was a final warning to Serb irregular forces besieging Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities that they must allow relief deliveries through.
But the diplomats cautioned that the actual use of force would complicate the conflict.
The UN moves came only hours after a sniper killed a US television journalist David Kaplan 45 in an attack on a convoy taking Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic into Sarajevo for peace talks.

FT 01 OCT 92 UN to quit Sudan s south after murders.
THE UNITED Nations is pulling out of southern Sudan after a UN worker and a foreign journalist were killed in mysterious circumstances at the weekend Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Mr Thomas Edval co ordinator of UN Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) said yesterday relief operations near the town of Juba were closed.
The main faction of the rebel Sudan People s Liberation Army said on Tuesday a splinter group had murdered a Norwegian journalist whose name it gave only as Helge and a UN staffer from Burma named Myint Moung and abducted two aid workers on Sunday.
Relief workers said starving millions in the region could face imminent death if the UN shut its operations.
The UN said an international outcry had scuttled a scheme by European companies to dump 10m tonnes of toxic waste in Somalia.
African and western governments were outraged last month by reports that a Somali claiming to be a government minister had signed a 20 year dumping deal.
Relief agencies said they were evacuating staff from the Somali port of Kismayu after constant threats by gunmen trying to loot food meant for the starving.
Aid workers were said to be blockaded in a UN compound by their own Somali guards because of disputes over money.

FT 13 APR 93 Pleas to curb South African violence.
SOUTH AFRICAN political leaders yesterday struggled to contain violent reaction to the assassination of prominent black activist Mr Chris Hani.
Condemnation of the killing from across the political spectrum coupled with pleas for restraint from black political leaders helped to limit the violence.
Mr Eugene Terre blanche leader of the right wing Afrikaner Weerstands Beweging (AWB) while confirming that the alleged assassin was an AWB member condemned the killing as atrocious over the weekend.
Meanwhile the African National Congress attempted to channel black anger into an organised campaign of mass protest action due to begin today.
But the danger that activists will fail to heed their call was illustrated yesterday when black gunmen opened fire on police and journalists during a rally in the Katlehong black township east of Johannesburg one of several gatherings held to protest at the assassination of Mr Hani.
The mass action campaign is due to culminate with the funeral of Mr Hani which is likely to be one of the largest political events in South African history.
ANC leaders made clear that negotiations would continue in spite of the murder.
They issued a statement urging respect for whites and condemning racial attacks.
It is true that the person who pulled the trigger that killed Hani is white.
equally true is that a white person informed the police of the registration and the colour of the car that his murderer used and led to his arrest.
Therefore colour does not play a role in this instance the statement said.
Several townships near Johannesburg were reported tense yesterday with looting and cars burned but protests appeared to be under control by evening.
The worst incident of apparent reaction came when blacks in a township near Cape Town burned to death three white men who had visited an illegal drinking establishment on Sunday.
Attackers cut off part of the tongue of one of the men.
Police said there was no evidence that the killings were directly connected to the Hani assassination but they probably reflect worsening racial tensions.
ANC Youth League officials called for armed attacks on whites at one township rally but ANC headquarters deplored the call.
Mass protests begin today with a picket at the Boksburg magistrate s court where the alleged assassin Mr Janusz Walus is due to appear.
Police said they will charge Mr Walus a Polish immigrant to South Africa with Mr Hani s murder.
Mr Walus appears to have links with organised white extremist groups though no such group has claimed responsibility.
He had a hit list of eight or nine assassination targets including leaders of the ANC the ruling National party and Hani s South African Communist party.
The weapon used in the murder was stolen by white supremacist Piet Rudolf three years ago from Air Force headquarters in Pretoria.
FT 03 JUN 93 Milosevic condemned over assaults on opponents.
SERBIA S President Slobodan Milosevic came under stinging attack yesterday over the arrest and beating of more than 20 opposition politicians and journalists in Belgrade.
Leaders of Serbia s democratic opposition denounced the violent crackdown in the wake of the ousting of Yugoslav federal president Dobrica Cosic earlier this week as a brutal crime.
Mr Cosic too breaking his silence added to the criticism of the Serbian leader likening him to Hitler.
Democratic politicians demanded the release of those arrested and the resignation of the interior minister.
But their call for a mass demonstration outside the federal parliament yesterday went unheeded.
The violence with which police broke up Tuesday night s protest against the removal of Mr Cosic apparently succeeded in intimidating opposition supporters.
Serbia s democratic opposition has become increasingly marginal as radical nationalist leaders backed by paramilitary groups have gained ground.
We are heading for worse troubles said Mr Borislav Mihailovic a member of Depos a coalition of democratic groups.
On Tuesday night police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at several thousand people gathered outside parliament the largest demonstration in Belgrade for more than two years.
One police officer died from gunshot wounds and more than 30 people were injured in street battles.
Mr Vuk Draskovic head of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) the largest opposition party was in serious condition with a fractured jaw and other injuries after he was beaten by police who burst into the party offices early yesterday morning an SPO spokesman said.
Mr Draskovic a charismatic figure who led violent demonstrations against the Milosevic government in 1991 was arrested with senior party officials and local journalists.
Mr Nicola Milosevic head of the Serb Liberal party said it was an unprecedently violent action instigated by Slobodan Milosevic and his police.
It is a totalitarian regime that arrests the leader of the biggest opposition party.
Commenting on his ousting by radical Serbs backed by socialists in the federal parliament Mr Cosic accused President Milosevic of despotic self will and a classical Stalinist act.
In an allusion to Adolf Hitler Mr Cosic described the Serbian president a former ally as Fuhrer of the Serbian Radical Party.
Bosnian Serb troops were reported to be closing in on the Moslem enclave of Gorazde yesterday as an upsurge of fighting threatened to disrupt aid operations across the former Yugoslav republic Reuter reports from Sarajevo.

FT 10 JUN 93 Andreotti may face murder link charge.
ROME magistrates yesterday announced that they wanted to press charges against Mr Giulio Andreotti seven times prime minister of Italy for allegedly organising the murder of a journalist in 1979.
It is the first time a former European leader has been faced with such allegations.
The announcement is a further devastating blow to the reputation of the veteran Christian Democrat politician.
Last month parliament agreed to waive Mr Andreotti s immunity as a life senator to face charges of consorting with the Mafia.
Mr Andreotti reacted strongly to yesterday s announcement.
I don t wish to avoid facing justice like any other citizen but I must raise my voice in moral indignation at this attempt to lynch me.
The latest move follows a long interrogation of Mr Andreotti on May 25 in connection with the killing of Mr Mino Pecorelli.
He was a journalist who published OP a small magazine that peddled in cryptic language inside information about politics the security services and the Mafia.
Mr Pecorelli was a member of the secret masonic lodge P2.
His death is widely believed to involve some of the murkiest aspects of recent Italian history linking politicians the Mafia and the security services.
The murder was seen as an attempt to silence an inconvenient voice.
He is reported to have had sensitive information about the kidnap and murder of Mr Aldo Moro the Christian Democrat prime minister by the leftwing terrorist group the Red Brigades.
Ten years of investigations ending in 1992 failed to find those responsible for Mr Pecorelli s death.
But last April Palermo magistrates are understood to have questioned Mr Tommaso Buscetta the Mafia supergrass living in the US about his allegations that Mr Andreotti was linked to the Pecorelli killing.
Mr Buscetta claimed the murder itself was carried out by Cosa Nostra the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia.
He also alleged that Mr Andreotti was behind the murder in 1982 of General Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa the Palermo police chief who was reported to have been killed because he too knew secrets about the Moro kidnap.
Rome magistrates yesterday indicated they were asking parliament to waive Mr Andreotti s immunity not solely on the basis of Mr Buscetta s information.

FT 14 JUL 93 Rising death toll stokes Somali hatred against UN.
The crusade against General Aideed has damaged the peacekeepers claim of impartiality.
shot stoned and clubbed to death by a mob seeking revenge for its own dead has laid bare how tragically the United Nations humanitarian mission in Somalia is unravelling.
Since the UN launched its night time bombing raids over the capital in retaliation for the slaying of 24 Pakistani soldiers last month gunmen loyal to General Mohamed Farah Aideed have turned south Mogadishu into an urban guerrilla war theatre.
The rising death toll 35 UN troops more than 100 Somalis and the UN s decision to single out Gen Aideed as the chief villain in a land of feuding warlords has stoked Somali hatred against what is now perceived by many as a foreign occupation force.
On Monday after American Cobra helicopters bombarded a compound in the heart of the city the hatred spilled over to encompass all foreigners.
The journalists who were mobbed and killed at the bombed compound were well known to the residents of south Mogadishu.
These Somalis used to entreat foreign reporters to come to see the destruction wrought by UN forces.
Mr Dan Eldon a 22 year old British American Reuters photographer was so well known in the area after working there for a year that he had been nicknamed the Mayor of Mogadishu.
That he should have been stoned to death indicates how radically the mood has changed.
The UN s crusade against Gen Aideed has made the general into a local hero when only a few months ago his authority was waning.
It has also damaged the UN s claim to be an impartial policeman and further undermined its credibility among Somalis.
Gen Aideed s National Somali Alliance claims a meeting of clan elders was taking place when the compound came under attack.
But Mr Barry Walkley the UN spokesman in Mogadishu insisted yesterday that the compound was a command centre and rallying point for Aideed militia.
We are convinced there was no loss of innocent lives during Monday s assault he said.
UN troops counted 13 militia (members) dead and 15 wounded maybe more.
The question of UN inflicted civilian casualties is straining relations among the 20 odd national contingents that comprise the 20 800 member UN peacekeeping force Suspicion mistrust and national rivalries are undermining the UN s military command structure formally under the authority of Turkish Gen Cevik Bir but led in practice by Gen Thomas Montgomery commander of the US forces in Somalia.
The 2 600 strong Italian contingent is now allegedly taking its orders from Rome and has refused to follow instructions from the UN command.
Leading Italian newspapers were united yesterday in their condemnation of the US led assault after Mr Fabio Fabbri defence minister openly called for the suspension of all UN combat operations in Mogadishu.
Rome fears the UN is sinking deeper into a military quagmire in Somalia and is reluctant to become involved in a prolonged senseless conflict.
Mr Fabbri s remarks earned him a sharp rebuke from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali the UN secretary general who said it was unacceptable for any troop contingent to take action outside UN command.
UN officials distrust what they see as Italy s separate agenda in its former colony.
They suspect the Italian contingent may have struck a deal with Gen Aideed s Habir Gedir clan following the deaths of three Italian soldiers earlier this month.
They believe the Italians may have created a safe haven for Gen Aideed s gunmen and perhaps even for the fugitive warlord himself.
Aid agencies too are increasingly critical of the UN s military operation for losing sight of its political and humanitarian objectives.
We are primarily concerned with the unnecessary loss of innocent lives said Mr Howard Bell of Care International who was in Mogadishu during Monday s assault.
It has become difficult to plan relief work as we cannot always rely on military escorts.
Care has withdrawn all but three foreign aid workers from Mogadishu due to the precarious security conditions in the capital.
It says it has not been able to supply its 35 feeding centres there on a regular basis since the UN launched its military strikes in June.
Before then Care was feeding 175 000 displaced Somalis in the capital every day.
The UN however insists that any idea of reconciling rival clans and promoting a political dialogue cannot be achieved until Gen Aideed s militias have been disarmed.
This country is awash with weapons and we are not naive about the enormity of the task.
But Mr Walkley admits that the UN is operating virtually under siege in the capital.
It has retreated into a heavily fortified compound on the outskirts of town.
UN staff are not allowed outside the compound and are transported to the airport and other sights by helicopter.
Outside the capital he says progress is being made in bringing clan elders together for talks.
Kismayo the southern port is reported to have been peaceful since two rival warlords were banished and truces have been negotiated in other areas.
But other Somalia watchers doubt whether the UN has the ability to fulfil its aims.
The UN is being naive if it thinks it can transform a desert region of nomadic tribes into a model democracy said Dr Murray Watson a scientist who lived in Somalia for 14 years.
I cannot think of a worse test case for the UN s new role as global policeman.
Somalis have a tradition in which blood crimes are repaid with blood.
For the past month they have been counting the death toll inflicted by the UN.
Foreigners will be killed in Somalia whether they wear a Blue Helmet a nurse s uniform or a camera.
If so says Edward Mortimer it is because its members expect too much.
Iraq s defiance increases threat of UN attack.
UN to maintain Somali action despite bloodshed.
Nato will use jets in Bosnia to protect UN s peace troops.
Every day this week the same two letters UN have leapt out at us in the newspaper headlines as the United Nations has struggled with three crises in three different continents.
In each case the world body was either using or threatening the use of military force in an increasingly desperate attempt to impose its authority on recalcitrant warlords.
And in each case there were visible strains on its cohesion as leading member governments argued among themselves and with the secretariat over the course of action to be pursued.
In Iraq the unity of the Security Council in taking a firm line with President Saddam Hussein was damaged last month when the US took unilateral action bombing Baghdad in retaliation for an Iraqi attempt to assassinate ex president George Bush.
Last weekend when a UN inspection team abruptly left Baghdad after being refused permission to seal off two missile testing sites the US s European allies feared they were about to be bounced into a new US led air attack.
In the event the Council sent Mr Rolf Ekeus head of the UN special commission on Iraq s weapons of mass destruction on a further trip to Baghdad to try to defuse the crisis.
Meanwhile the spotlight switched to Somalia where US helicopters serving with the UN force bombarded a command centre used by General Mohammed Farah Aideed a Somali warlord who has been defying UN orders to disarm and has ordered attacks on UN troops.
The US claimed only 13 Somalis were killed in the attack but the International Committee of the Red Cross gave a figure of 54 while General Aideed s supporters produced a videotape showing scores of bodies.
Four foreign journalists were killed by a mob seeking revenge.
Italy one of the main contributors to the UN force called for a suspension of combat operations and a reconsideration of the overall objective and warned that it would withdraw its troops if differences over the conduct of the operation could not be resolved.
Mr Kofi Annan the UN undersecretary general in charge of peacekeeping operations responded by announcing that the UN had demanded the recall of the Italian commander General Bruno Loi who was said to have taken orders from Rome instead of from the UN force commander General Civek Bir.
Yesterday the Italian government bluntly refused to comply with this demand declaring that General Loi enjoyed its full confidence.
But if the UN was embarrassed by the threat of European troops pulling out in Somalia it was scarcely less so by the offer from seven Islamic countries to send troops into Bosnia Hercegovina.
The existing mainly western contributors have conspicuously failed to send enough troops to defend the UN safe areas for Bosnian Moslems.
Yet they fear that the arrival of up to 18 000 soldiers from other Moslem countries including 10 000 from revolutionary Iran would only exacerbate the conflict pitting Moslems against Christians on an international scale.
The UN is expected to accept an offer from Nato to deploy ground attack aircraft over Bosnia which may add some credibility to the safe areas plan.
But it could be further embarrassed by the fact that these aircraft would not be mandated to act directly in defence of the beleaguered Moslems but only to protect the UN s own ground forces.
The danger of a Somali style escalation with the UN appearing to engage in its own blood feud with local forces and the humanitarian objective being pushed into the background is obvious enough.
Coincidentally this week also saw the publication of a report from the foreign affairs committee of the British House of Commons criticising the ill thought out expansion of the UN s worldwide military role and in particular the way the UN operation in Bosnia is being transformed from peacekeeping to enforcement with no clear understanding of the different principles involved.
Bosnia Iraq and Somalia are by no means the only crises the UN is currently involved in.
It has had its successes in recent years notably in bringing peace to El Salvador and Namibia.
Its most conspicuous recent failure was in Angola where civil war has resumed after last year s UN supervised election.
Observers are now holding their breath to see whether the same will happen in Cambodia.
The Angolan experience partly explains the tough attitude UN officials are taking towards the warlords in Somalia.
It shows they believe the absolute necessity of disarming the factions if any peaceful solution is to stick.
and they point out that many Somalis have supported the action against General Aideed.
Yet the results have appalled many old UN hands.
Sir Brian Urquhart UN undersecretary general until 1986 and regarded as the main architect of the UN s traditional peacekeeping role winces at reports of UN retaliation in Somalia.
Nobody s thought out what the nature of the UN s activities really is.
This line was echoed in a New York Times editorial on Wednesday.
It should not be gunning down Somalis from helicopters no matter what warlord they support.
UN officials argue that this line of criticism reflects nostalgia for the cold war era when the UN was limited to relatively straightforward peacekeeping operations usually in interstate conflicts where the parties had already agreed to cease fire.
The Somali operation they explain is the first of a new type with an explicit mandate under Chapter VII of the charter the part that refers to enforcement.
The result is that command and control are now disintegrating with national contingents taking orders from national governments.
To avoid this he has revived a proposal made in 1948 by the UN s first secretary general Trygve Lie for a volunteer military force to be recruited directly by the UN and placed at the disposal of the Security Council.
He believes such a force could be sent in quickly for instance when the Council orders a ceasefire to show that the UN is serious.
But since the force would necessarily be small and could hardly be deployed in more than two or three parts of the world at the same time it is not clear what the next move would be if its arrival failed to have the desired effect.
What is clear is that apart from inevitable blunders through lack of experience the UN is above all the victim of the expectations vested in it by its members in a world pullulating with local conflicts and no longer disciplined by great power rivalry.
Few can be solved without the military defeat of the warlords the imposition of peace by external power for a prolonged period and the use of that period to rebuild social and political structures.
That is a process closely akin to old style colonial government.
The UN at present has neither the machinery nor the resources to undertake it.

HOPES for an early end to Nicaragua s hostage crisis were hit yesterday after a guerrilla leader issued fresh conditions for the release of 18 government officials agencies report from Managua.
In a stand off which reflects the bitter divisions left by the country s brutal eight year civil war armed gangs of the left and right are holding more than 40 officials politicians and journalists at two different sites.
A group of former US backed Contra rebels in the remote northern village of El Zungano freed 20 of their 38 prisoners late on Sunday after talks with envoys including an Organisation of American States representative.
Last Thursday the rebels led by Jose Angel Talavera alias El Chacal (The Jackal) seized 38 government officials soldiers and leftist Sandinista politicians who had travelled to El Zungano to try to persuade him to lay down his arms.
He originally demanded the firing of armed forces chief General Humberto Ortega and presidential chief of staff Mr Antonio Lacayo whom he accuses of plotting to allow the former governing Sandinistas to continue ruling Nicaragua despite their 1990 election defeat by President Violeta Chamorro.
On Sunday he settled for a pledge from the government to review a list of his grievances only to return to his original demands yesterday.
In Managua a group of about eight pro Sandinista gunmen retaliated on Friday against Mr Talavera s hostage taking by seizing the headquarters of the conservative National Opposition Union (UNO) party taking prisoner Nicaragua s vice president Virgilio Godoy and several dozen UNO leaders.
The group freed 16 prisoners at the weekend and two more yesterday.
However they also took about eight journalists hostage on Sunday.

The USS Harlan County with about 200 US personnel on board was blocked from docking in Port au Prince Haiti s capital.
Foreign journalists were beaten up and embassy personnel were turned away from the port by protesters.

FT 23 OCT 93 Kashmiri conflict destroys a paradise.
Why prospects for a peaceful settlement appear more remote than ever.
THE siege of the Hazratbal mosque the holiest Moslem shrine in Kashmir in northern India is the result of four years of violence and four decades of political dispute.
Neither the separatists hiding inside the white marble buildings nor the Indian troops surrounding them are in any mood to compromise.
The militants who seized the shrine a week ago want to walk free with their heads held high.
What is true for the siege seems tragically true for Kashmir as a whole.
the uprising which started in late 1989 and which the security forces have tried to suppress with brutal force has almost killed hopes for a peaceful resolution of south Asia s most serious conflict.
The violence is prompting the international community to look at Kashmir with renewed urgency out of concern for the fighting and for the damage done to relations between India and neighbouring Pakistan.
Much of Kashmir today is in the grip of a military style occupation by at least 150 000 Indian soldiers and paramilitary troops who have replaced the local Kashmiri police in front line security duties.
A mainly Moslem population of 8m is ruled by a Hindu dominated administration.
Civilian officials go about their work under armed guard.
In Srinagar the capital and in other towns there are sand bagged bunkers at strategic points.
Barbed wire is as common on the roadside as Kashmir s famous wild flowers.
Wooden houseboats which until the late 1980s took thousands of visitors across Kashmir s limpid green lakes are now rotting at their moorings.
Sringar s Lal Chowk the main market is scarred by the blackened ruins of buildings set alight during disturbances earlier this year by the security forces according to the residents who fled their homes in terror.
Elsewhere are the remains of a 200 year old mansion burnt down by militants.
According to police figures some 7 500 people have been killed since the start of 1990 including 635 members of the security forces.
Militants put the Kashmiri death toll including insurgents and civilians at 20 000.
The police allege militants spread terror by murder kidnapping robbery extortion and rape.
They also kill each other in bloody inter group conflicts.
international human rights groups have documented scores of cases of brutality including killing suspects on arrest and in custody rape and torture.
Just this week Mr Mukhar Ahmed a 25 year old Kashmiri journalist was arrested and interrogated for 13 hours.
Trembling with fear he showed marks on his ears where he said he was given electric shocks and bruises on the soles of his feet where he said he was beaten.
The Kashmir dispute began with the bloody partition of India in 1947 when Kashmiri hopes for independence were ignored as Pakistan and India divided the territory.
In 1949 the two countries agreed with the United Nations that the status of Kashmir should be determined by a plebiscite but it has never been held.
In 1972 India and Pakistan signed an agreement in the resort town of Shimla to the effect that Kashmir was a bilateral issue so third parties including Kashmiris and UN officials no longer had a say.
Indian officials argue the time for plebiscites is past and Indian held Kashmir is an integral part of India.
Pakistan describes Indian held Kashmir as disputed territory which it claims for itself.
Mr Mahmood Rahman a senior official of the local state government admits that the alienation of Kashmiris is getting worse.
Indian officials blame Pakistan for fomenting militancy by sending money arms and trained terrorists.
But the roots of insurgency lie much deeper principally in the fact that this isolated mountain land has been independent for long periods of time and in common with other peoples united by history and culture Kashmiris now want to assert their independence.
Most want to form a new state though a significant minority including some powerful Pakistan backed militant groups would prefer to acceed to Pakistan.
Nationalist feelings has been heightened by religious differences.
the global rise of Islamic militancy has given courage to Kashmiri insurgents and eroded Kashmir s tradition of Hindu Moslem tolerance.
Over the years Delhi has been caught between promoting democratic politics in Kashmir and suppressing anti Indian political activity.
The result is that about half urban Kashmiri youths are unemployed and so are fertile ground for militancy.
Kashmiri political leaders take heart from recent global political changes.
Like the Soviet Union broke up India may also break up says Professor Abdul Gani a representative of the All Party Freedom Conference a newly formed umbrella organisation of Kashmiri political groups.
Mr Gani suggests putting Kashmir (including Pakistani held territory) under UN administration for five years followed by a plebiscite.
For Mr Rahman the state government official such suggestions are anathema.

Britain yesterday suspended all official aid convoys throughout the former Yugoslavia after gunmen believed to be Moslems shot dead a British aid worker and wounded two others as they tried to escape in the central Bosnian town of Zenica.
Only hours after the incident three journalists working for Italian state television were killed in fighting in the south western Bosnian town of Mostar which is under siege by Bosnian Croat irregular troops.
The Italian Foreign Ministry said the three a reporter a cameraman and a sound technician for the state broadcasting organisation RAI were killed during a mortar attack in the Moslem held eastern part of the town.
The British aid workers employees of the Overseas Development Administration were abducted in Moslem controlled Zenica by a group of uniformed men with assault rifles according to Ms Sylvana Foa spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The way it was described to us in the first report (by the two survivors) was that it was a gang an armed gang she said.
I don t think this is the policy of any government to do something like this.
After being seized in their Range Rover outside the European Union s relief warehouse in Zenica the Britons were driven out of town and ordered out of their vehicle.
One of the Britons Mr Paul Goodall was shot dead immediately while the other two ran away towards a river.
Mr Goodall was the 11th aid worker to be killed in the former Yugoslavia.
The UNHCR is also considering whether to suspend its aid operations in the area as it did for a month after an aid convoy driver was shot dead in October according to the organisation s spokesman in Sarajevo Mr Ron Redmond.
