FT 27 APR 91 World Bank rejects loans policy attack.
THE HEAD of the World Bank yesterday outlined measures to counter US criticism that the bank was not doing enough to help the private sector in developing countries.
However Mr Barber Conable president of the bank rejected the notion that it should have a specific target for private sector lending as suggested by the US.
He also said that support for direct lending to the private sector by the bank a controversial proposal also envisaged by the US did not have strong support from shareholders.
The US has suggested that the bank group direct 50 per cent of its lending to the private sector by 1995 in negotiations over a capital increase for the bank s private sector affiliate the International Finance Corporation.
The IFC which makes equity and debt investment direct to the private sector is seeking a Dollars 1.
Mr Conable thought that at meetings over the next few days of finance ministers in Washington agreement could be achieved that an increase was needed.
Agreement over a figure would follow later he said.
The measures to increase the bank s role in the private sector include strengthening a private sector policy guidance committee changing staff guidelines to improve co ordination between the Bank and IFC and incorporating the IFC into the development of private sector strategies for borrowing countries.
Developing countries will face a shortage of official development finance over the next decade according to the World Bank s new chief economist.
Mr Lawrence Summers said a restoration of large transfers of development money to third world countries was not in sight.
The World Bank group itself had transferred Dollars 9 per head of the population (in 1991 dollars) to the developing world between 1975 and 1980.
Over the next five years this figure would be Dollars 2.
Those countries not eligible to borrow from the Bank s soft loan affiliate would actually be transferring money to the bank.
Since there will not be much development money over the next decade there had better be a lot of good ideas he told a conference.
He said that improving the efficiency with which capital is used was more important than the amount of transfers.
2 per cent would do more for living standards than an additional Dollars 100bn of capital.
FT 30 APR 91 More help offered to Third World cities.
THE World Bank has agreed to change its policies towards urban development in the light of the rapid growth of Third World cities bank officials said yesterday.
The bank has been trying to address urban problems mainly through lending for housing and other narrowly based projects.
The new approach taking account of the expectation that by 2000 half the population in the Third World will live in cities will attempt to make urban development an important component of its overall development strategy.
It will aim to encourage the improvement of urban productivity and reduce the impediments to growth.
The focus would include attempts to lighten the regulatory restrictions on growth of private businesses to tackle the weakness in many local governments and to address weak financial systems.
A new emphasis would be tackling urban poverty.
The bank would also focus on arresting and reversing the environmental deterioration which accompanied rapid urban growth.
Mr Nicholas Brady US Treasury Secretary yesterday suggested a World Bank fund facility or subsidiary to back long term Middle East development after the Gulf war.
He told the International Monetary Fund s policy making Interim Committee that the new facility should be supported by or co ordinated with the IMF.
Mr Pierre Be re govoy French finance minister said yesterday he saw no need for a new lending institution for the Middle East.
Instead the industrialised nations should co operate closely to help the region and the Maghreb of North Africa also badly hit by the effects of the Gulf war.
US seeks to raise World Bank s private profile Fears the bank will lose relevance if it deals only with the public sector.
Although the US the bank s dominant shareholder says the move should be seriously considered it would change fundamentally the basis on which the institution has operated since its birth after the Second World War.
The debate has been prompted by a call from the World Bank affiliate the International Finance Corporation for a doubling of its Dollars 1.
The IFC headed by Sir William Ryrie a former British civil servant is the part of the World Bank group created to lend and make equity investment direct to the private sector.
It cannot lend with a government guarantee but claims its capital limitations are already preventing it from growing at the pace it should.
It believes its 20 per cent annual growth rate in the late 1980s should slow to 12 per cent but without a capital infusion soon its growth would slow to 6 per cent or less.
The collapse of the communist model in eastern Europe has reinforced a sea change already under way in many developing countries.
This has placed the private sector and functioning markets at the centre of development plans.
While applauding this the US wants to see any debate on the capital increase dependent on the World Bank itself increasing its role in the private sector.
The price for any capital increase would be for the World Bank group including the IFC to direct 50 per cent of its lending to the private sector by 1995.
The US also envisages that eventually the bank might change its articles of association to allow it to lend directly to the private sector.
As explained by US officials the reasoning behind the proposal is that with the increasing role of the private sector in developing countries the bank risks losing its relevance in the 1990s if it deals only with the public sector.
A capital increase by the IFC alone would not meet the needs for private sector development.
The suggestion has prompted the bank to suggest a series of changes which will increase its explicit involvement in the private sector.
But there is concern among bank officials about the US proposal.
Mr Barber Conable the bank s president says a 50 per cent target for loans directed to the private sector risks subterfuge suggesting the bank would simply redefine loans so they fitted into the right category.
Mr Larry Summers the bank s new chief economist speaks of a confusion between measures which help the private sector to flourish and direct aid to companies in the private sector.
The former area providing the so called enabling environment for the private sector roads telephones and electricity is where the bank has its comparative advantage he says.
The establishment of significant private sector expertise in the bank also risks expanding its 6 000 strong bureaucracy and overlapping with the work the IFC already does.
Even if the proposal were adopted it is unclear what it would mean.
The term lending directed towards the private sector has an elasticity which makes its impact vague.
On its proposal for the bank to lend directly to the private sector the US is in a minority among shareholders possibly numbering one.
But given the importance of the US agenda and the need to push the regularly requested capital infusions of international institutions through the US Congress the proposal cannot be ignored.
The prospect of lending to the private sector frightens some bank officials.
the bank s top credit rating enables it to borrow at premium rates in the world s financial markets.
Lending to the private sector would add immeasurably to the risks it already faces adding the question of commercial risk to that of a country s willingness or ability to pay.
The IFC s own portfolio is said to reinforce this view.
Some bank officials argue its lending record is at best chequered.
FT 11 MAY 92 World Bank links loan volume to poverty relief.
THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country s efforts to fight poverty according to an operational directive to staff issued today by Mr Lewis Preston the bank s president.
The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank s central mission in the 1990s.
The shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to make comprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third world allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty.
In the directive Mr Preston says poverty reduction is the benchmark by which our performance as a development institution will be measured.
He adds that the new instructions to staff are intended to ensure that these policies are fully reflected in the bank s operations.
The bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past best practice on poverty reduction.
The bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developing countries within two years.
These would form the basis for a collaborative approach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank.
The directive signals an attempt to impose a form of social conditionality on borrowing countries.
Stronger government commitment to poverty reduction warrants greater support.
conversely weaker commitment to poverty reduction warrants less support it says.
Mr Preston s emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the 1980s when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing countries.
The new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past decade overshadowed the bank s poverty reduction objectives.
The bank is also reacting to new evidence suggesting that the number of poor in developing countries will rise during the 1990s rather than stabilise as had been expected.
Children s charity fears about World Bank priority for poorest (1).
Sir The recognition by the World Bank that the global environment debate has largely ignored the most serious problems facing developing countries ( Environment debate ignores plight of poor May 18) should be given a guarded welcome.
Many individuals and organisations including Save the children will support the priorities for action listed in the World Bank s World Development Report.
These include stress on the need to address the problems of lack of clean water and adequate sanitation.
That the welcome should be guarded is because of fears about the priority which will be given to that list of priorities.
Throughout the 1980s the World Bank played a dominant role in promoting structural adjustment policies in many developing countries.
Save the Children and other organisations argued that the effects of such policies on the most vulnerable in society particularly children should be considered in advance.
The World Bank and International Monetary fund were urged to adopt policies which would seek to improve the productivity and income of the poor and were told that services vital for the most vulnerable should be reinforced.
Despite the welcome comments in the World Bank report particularly on the need for education for women fears remain that the World Bank sees concern for the poorest as something which can be tacked on to an otherwise unchanged policy of economic adjustment.
International institutions must recognise that human and environmental objectives like the needs of mothers and children must be at the centre of an integrated longer term development policy.

FT 20 JUN 92 World Bank admits Indian dam flawed.
THE World Bank is to make substantial modifications in plans for one of the world s biggest dam projects after accepting criticism of the project in an independent report as justified.
Mr Lewis Preston the World Bank president said the report on the controversial Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.
6bn) Narmada dam system in central India had identified a number of deficiencies in the bank s appraisal of the project the borrower s implementation and the bank s supervision work.
The independent inquiry the first of its kind in the World Bank s history was set up after vociferous protests in India over the resettlement and environmental aspects of the project.
In a rare and candid admission that the Bank had been wrong Mr Preston said.
It is clear that performance under these projects has fallen short of what is called for under Bank policies and guidelines and the policies of the government of India.
He said continued bank support for Narmada was justified but we should proceed only if practical ways can be agreed to ensure that the pace of further construction of the dam is adjusted to whatever extent is required to permit a fully responsible approach to the resettlement and environmental concerns.
Mr Preston said analysis of the report and a set of specific remedial actions would be presented to the World Bank s board in the next few days.
The bank has promised to put Dollars 450m into the irrigation scheme along the Narmada river which flows through the north eastern states of Madhya Pradesh Gujarat and Maharashtra.
Opponents of the project say such huge dams are environmentally unsound and accuse the state governments of resettling people many of them tribal people not integrated into India on inferior land with inadequate compensation.
WORLD COMMODITY prices sank to an all time low in real terms last year according to the World Bank.
In its recently published annual report the bank attributed this is bleak news for the developing countries to a worldwide slowdown in economic activity a trend which has only worsened this year.
Economic difficulties in the Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe generally tended to lower commodity prices except for basic food stuffs the report continued.
Although price indexes for cereals and fats were slightly higher than in 1990 beverage prices were down by 5.
In fact coffee cocoa and tea prices hit all time lows in inflation adjusted terms.
One of the World Bank s commodity specialists Mr Takamasa Akiyama said worldwide recession had only a short and medium term effect on the price declines.
Basically the difficulty in commodity production is the vast productivity increases of the producing countries.
There are a number of factors contributing to productivity increases but one of them is the World Bank itself according to some of its critics including Mr Kevin Watkins senior economist at Oxfam.
The bank s structural adjustment programme has contributed to the chronic price depression by encouraging production of commodities for world markets which are already saturated Mr Watkins said.
It had pushed production he said on the ideological assumption that each country must produce what it produced best according to its comparative advantage whether or not there was too much of a commodity around.
It also wanted to help the developing countries repay their debts.
That is a question it ought to address Mr Watkins said.
The bank has long recognised the danger in backing overproduction and it has often tried to restrict such lending.
Mr Watkins said however that he doubted that the bank s country departments talked to each other about their loans.
As one example he cited support of palm oil production in both Malaysia and Indonesia two huge suppliers whose output significantly affects world price.
The bank said it tried to limit commodity loans to countries that did not have investment alternatives or simply needed to improve their current productive capacity.
However between 1983 and 1986 it approved 15 projects that were expected to lead to increased coffee production.
Mr Akiyama said the bank had little choice but to help a country increase its productivity lest it lose out to more efficient producers.
FT 27 OCT 92 Britain attacks World Bank over Indian project.
THE World Bank s handling of the Sardar Sarovar project in India s Narmada valley has raised questions about its commitment to public accountability the British government said yesterday.
In an unusual public criticism of the bank s management the Overseas Development Administration said normal processes for monitoring implementation of projects had failed.
It hoped it would not be necessary again to commission an independent review of a bank funded project.
Following a report by Mr Bradford Morse a former administrator of the United Nations Development Programme and Mr Thomas Berger a former Canadian Supreme Court judge the World Bank s executive board decided on Friday to continue funding the project subject to a rigorous performance review next April.
However Mr David Peretz UK executive director of the bank said that since India intended to proceed with or without support continued Bank involvement offered the best hope for rescuing the project.
Mr Peretz said the Morse report was a serious indictment of the Indian authorities and the Bank s management.
The pattern of inadequate supervision and enforcement fits in with concerns we have expressed for some time about the Bank s capacity to monitor large or complex projects.
MR Susil Sirivardana commissioner of the Janasaviya (Poverty Alleviation) Programme laughed at the suggestion that he was a frustrated revolutionary.
After two hours discussing the plight of Sri Lanka s poor and the inequities of its elite this was a rare moment of light relief.
9bn was developed by government in response to the 1987 89 People s Liberation Front (JVP) left wing insurgency.
The JVP comes from the frustrated polarised educated rural youth explains Mr Sirivardana who says that 15 years of liberal economic policy has produced a polarisation of society and a decline in human development.
In the 1988 election President Ranasinghe Premadasa ran on a platform of poverty alleviation which promised to put people first especially the poor and the poorest of the poor.
Janasaviya is the fulfilment of that promise and in Mr Sirivardana who participated and was jailed for his part in a JVP inspired insurrection in 1971 Mr Premadasa has chosen an emotionally committed administrator.
With Janasaviya we told the poor This is not the old politicised corrupt crooked deal you are revolting against.
If you are revolting against social injustice here you can create justice says Mr Sirivardana.
The programme involves almost 350 000 families and provides two forms of government support.
The families receive a a monthly entitlement of SLRs1 458 with which to purchase specified consumer goods such as food and clothing from co operatives.
In return each family is asked to put in 20 days of community related work.
Then after two years on the programme families become entitled to a SLRs25 000 Janasaviya Entitlement Certificate.
While this is not available as cash it pays interest of SLRs250 a month and can be pledged to a bank as collateral for a loan.
In 1989 its first year of operation the programme attracted the ire of the World Bank.
In its latest Sri Lanka report the bank said Janasaviya initially suffered two major shortcomings.
Second the supposed production orientation of the programme was missing.
The screening process for deserving families has been improved and the Janasaviya Trust funded by donors including the World Bank has been set up to identify civil works projects.
These range from crop cultivation to local infrastructure projects.
According to the bank s report the trust should ensure that those refusing to participate in a productive activity would be dropped from the programme immediately.
Mr Sirivardana recognises that the World Bank views some of the programme s components as welfare and subsidy.
He argues that Sri Lanka has suffered adverse domestic effects a worsening incidence of poverty and a deterioration in health and education services in its effort to become internationally competitive.
I see it definitely as a policy failure and preventable he says.
The criticism which is not new of World Bank sponsored economic adjustment programmes is supported by the facts.
Between 1981 and 1985 the share of national household income of the poorest third of the population dropped from 15 per cent to 11 per cent while the richest third grew from 52 per cent to 62 per cent.
In the same period economists estimate the purchasing power of the poorest third of the population declined by about 10 per cent.
In terms of minimum calory requirements a quarter of Sri Lanka s population remains below the poverty line.
This is despite Sri Lanka s notable achievements in the sectors of health and education.
The nation retains probably the highest literacy rate of all developing countries with about 90 per cent of the population above the age of 10 years officially literate.
Sri Lanka also has an impressive health record with an infant mortality rate of just 19 in 1 000 live births.
Almost 90 per cent of children receive standard immunisation.
In part this is the legacy of the 1950 70 period when for example government expenditure on education averaged 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).
During the last JVP insurgency the universities were closed for two years and schools and hospitals were severely disrupted.
The JVP could just by rumour or anonymous letter shut down whole institutions.
The government has since taken steps to reverse the decline and the education budget is currently 3 per cent of GDP.
Mr Pieris says the government would spend more if the continuing Tamil conflict were solved and the defence budget reduced.
But the most important element of the government s social initiative is the Janasaviya programme providing a safety net for the country s most disadvantaged.
Janasaviya officials query however whether the programme is a short term holding effort a political response to the JVP exigency or if it can become a comprehensive effort to in Mr Sirivardana s words change the social order.
Despite his energy and conviction Mr Sirivardana concedes that the future for Sri Lanka s poor remains dim.
He reluctantly accepts that investment by the poor in itself is insufficient to take them out of the poverty trap.
You ve got to have an active support system including an effective agricultural extension service he says.
in its Janasaviya programme and other policy areas it will not be possible to eradicate poverty altogether.
The Janasaviya programme Mr Sirivardana insists has had important benefits by generating a great deal of hope among the poor and those who care for them.
FT 25 NOV 92 World Bank debates its role as lender Assessing a damning report on the bank s portfolio.
THE World Bank s executive board yesterday began discussion on one of the most comprehensive reviews of its portfolio management based on a study that has opened up a fierce debate over how well the Washington based multilateral institution is fulfilling its role of development lending.
The report produced by a taskforce under the chairmanship of Mr Willi Wapenhans a World Bank veteran paints a stark picture of the deteriorating quality of the bank s portfolio of projects in the 1980s.
World Bank staff are used to being criticised for clumsy bureaucracy tax free salaries and lending to environmentally damaging projects but the Wapenhans report suggests the bank is failing even on its own terms.
The proportion of projects showing major problems in the World Bank s Dollars 138bn (Pounds 91bn) loan portfolio rose from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent a decade later.
Of projects in their fourth or fifth year of implementation in 1991 30 per cent had substantial problems with project categories such as water supply sanitation and agriculture demonstrating particularly severe difficulties.
In addition the bank is finding that it takes an average of two and a half years longer to complete a project than its staff estimates.
Much of this deterioration can be attributed to factors outside the control of any institution such as the oil shock debt crisis and steady worsening terms of trade for developing nations.
The taskforce suggested it may also reflect more realistic assessments of performance by bank staff.
But the report points to severe shortcomings in the conception and appraisal of projects shortcomings deeply rooted in the bank s corporate attitudes a culture that promotes loan volume as the measurement of success and an arrogance that leads the bank to impose its own projects on borrowers rather than responding to their needs.
Bank staff take a negotiating not a consulting position they know what they want from the outset and aren t open to hearing what the country has to say the taskforce concluded after consulting representatives from borrowing countries.
In fact the Wapenhans report finds the more time bank staff spend on the preparation of a project the less likely it is to succeed perhaps because these are the projects to which the borrower is least committed.
Borrowers complain staff may make matters still worse by imposing endless and unhelpful conditions to ensure the bank board will approve the loan and by adding in elements of the policy du jour be it import substitution export promotion women s programmes or environmental concerns.
Other critics say one of the reasons why portfolio supervision has deteriorated is that many of the bank s engineers who revelled in getting their boots dirty in on site inspections have been replaced by economists who stay in their hotels reading reports.
Yet say some World Bank insiders those hands on engineers tended to promote their own specialities whereas the economists take a broader view of a country s needs.
If you had a port engineer in south Asia you could be pretty sure you would get one or two port projects a year in south Asia said one bank director.
The Wapenhans report comes on the heels of a fiery debate inside and outside the bank over its handling of the Dollars 3bn Sardar Sarovar dam and irrigation projects on the Narmada river in western India.
Environmentalist groups have for years complained that the bank ignored all the warning signs about the Narmada dam s impact on the environment and on peasant farmers.
Despite a damning independent report from a commission headed by Mr Bradford Morse a former administrator of the United Nations Development Project the World Bank board decided last month to allow the project to go ahead although the executive directors who represent member countries set strict benchmarks to be met by April.
The problem is that institutionally there is no incentive to slow down projects for environmental or social quality reasons.
Your career incentives are to push projects through says Ms Lori Udall of the Washington based Environmental Defence Fund.
It is nothing new for the World Bank to be scratching its head over its missions and its corporate culture.
Former presidents Tom Clausen and Barber Conable each implemented his own management overhaul.
Mr Lewis Preston the former chairman of Morgan Guaranty who took over as president last year has made his own reforms and hundreds of bank employees are now waiting for reassignment.
However by commissioning the Wapenhans taskforce in February Mr Preston had in a way answered a central criticism of the report it was to produce.
Successful implementation of approved operations outweighs new annual commitments as an indicator of the bank s development effectiveness he wrote.
Already the bank s traditional emphasis on global loan volume as a measure of its success in transferring resources to third world customers has been somewhat muted.
The latest annual report shows signs of fewer loans rushed through before the end of the fiscal year to burnish the statistics.
Many non governmental organisations however complain that the entire career structure has been unchanged by top down reforms and continues to reward employees largely on the basis of their loan volume.
But some are encouraged by Mr Preston s recognition of his organisation s problems.
perhaps he will be able to change its culture in a way that has eluded his predecessors.
Environmental groups reacted with dismay yesterday at the decision of the International Finance Corporation the World Bank s private sector arm to finance a Dollars 500m hydroelectric dam on the upper reaches of Chile s biggest river the Bio Bio writes Leslie Crawford in Santiago.
The 450MW Pangue dam is scheduled to come on stream in 1997 when it will supply 12 per cent of Chile s total energy needs.
The Bio Bio Action Group a coalition of US and Chilean ecologists said the IFC loan violated all the World Bank s environmental guidelines.
It was particularly critical of the IFC s decision to back the project while studies on the downstream impact of the dam were pending.
In Washington an IFC spokesman said the corporation was confident further work would mitigate the power station s effect on the water levels of the Bio Bio.
FT 30 MAR 93 India to drop World Bank dam loans.
Government refuses to meet stiff conditions on Dollars 3bn project.
THE Indian government is to ask the World Bank to cancel its remaining loans for a half finished Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.
1bn) scheme to dam the Narmada River in north western India following intense criticism of the project s impact on the environment and on villagers who will lose their land.
But the Indian authorities are likely to press ahead with the project which would generate hydroelectricity and bring irrigation and drinking water to about 30m people.
The Indian government is expected to disclose today that it will not meet tough conditions laid down by the World Bank six months ago for its continued participation in the scheme.
India was asked by the bank to improve detailed plans for resettling displaced villagers and to prepare a full study of the project s environmental effects.
The bank s withdrawal will highlight the growing power of international environmental campaigners and raise doubts about the value of projects such as dams in developing countries.
It could also prompt questions about future relations between aid agencies and Third World governments.
Much of the Dollars 450m loan the World Bank committed to the project has already been spent.
The bank will now block the release of the remaining Dollars 170m and could persuade the project s other foreign backers including the Japanese government which has promised loans worth Y25bn (Pounds 146.
The Narmada project first mooted in 1946 was delayed by disputes between the three states which share the Narmada s waters Gujarat Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.
The arguments were resolved only in 1979 and it was not until 1985 that the World Bank approved its loan.
By then environmental lobbyists power in India and overseas was growing.
Economists were starting to question the merits of big dams in that they rarely delivered the full benefits expected and caused environmental damage.
But the Indian government and the World Bank saw the Narmada scheme as a chance to learn from past mistakes.
So the scheme went ahead with stringent conditions for resettling and paying compensation to displaced villagers and for an environmental master plan.
Pressure from activist groups forced the World Bank in 1991 to commission an unprecedented independent review by Mr Bradford Morse a former senior US development aid administrator and Mr Thomas Berger a former Canadian Supreme Court judge.
The report delivered last summer condemned the alleged failure to protect the environment or the interests of displaced villagers.
While World Bank officials continued to back the project the bank s directors representing member countries began to voice doubts.
The US Japan and Germany among others last autumn raised the possibil ity of dropping the scheme.
But a bank board meeting in October agreed to give India until March 31 to meet new conditions.
India has been unable to forge a consensus on the bank s conditions between the central government and three interested states not least because New Delhi has been preoccupied with the recent wave of inter religious violence.
Some Indian officials will be relieved they can continue with the scheme without time consuming monitoring from the World Bank.
They claim the bank has exercised inordinate influence given it was contributing only some 15 per cent of the funds.
But the World Bank s pullout could well boost the efforts of Indian anti Narmada campaigners who have won national attention by staging demonstrations on the banks of the reservoir which is steadily filling up behind the Sardar Sarovar Dam the biggest of several being built across the Narmada and its tributaries.
THE CONTRAST between the grandeur of Mr Jacques Attali s self styled European Bank and disbursements of a mere Ecu200m (Pounds 125m) after two years of existence is bound to attract hostile comment.
The EBRD must be judged on whether it makes a useful contribution to reform of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union rather than on the magnificence of its offices or the flying arrangements of its president.
Some Pounds 200m was spent on its offices and overheads between April 1991 and the end of 1992.
It is difficult to feel confident that the directors responsible for supervising its expenditures ensured these sums were all essential since they are themselves beneficiaries of EBRD largesse.
In this and other respects the problem lies more with the model on which it was founded than with the EBRD itself.
Politicians complain incessantly about the fat cat life style of institutions such as the World Bank.
To this charge the latter reply that many of their employees enjoy alternative opportunities in the private sector.
that they are not lavish by the standards of private sector financial institutions.
What makes the questions about the EBRD s life style more pointed is that many wondered whether it should have been established in the first place.
Some argued that it would divert attention from the need to provide generous assistance and liberal market access to the newly liberated countries.
To Mr Attali s credit it is here that the EBRD has been most effective.
It may be made of Carrara marble but he has used it well particularly on the need for Continent wide free trade.
Yet the EBRD cannot be justified by the ability of its president to say sensible things.
The question is whether it can also become an effective lending institution.
Many believed that the EBRD s mandate to lend 60 per cent of its money to the private sector would prove a crippling handicap.
Yet so far the more important obstacle to rapid disbursement has been the public sector.
The EBRD is affected like everything else by the political chaos of most countries of the former eastern bloc.
But lending to the public sector is not the EBRD s sole problem.
Its desire to lend prudently clashes with the need to take risks in support of the fledgling private sector.
It needs to demonstrate control over its own spending but above all it needs to lend effectively without lending foolishly.
It may never be possible to be sure that the EBRD serves a useful purpose.
But it must make a serious effort to convince the world it does.
FT 17 APR 93 World Bank IMF wage bills to rise by 6.
Institutions defend pay increases against opposition of rich member countries.
DIRECTORS of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have voted for a pay increase that will increase wage bills at the two Washington based institutions next year by more than 6 per cent.
Despite opposition from the US UK Canada and Australia which together represent a third of the voting capital of the IMF and World Bank the two boards this week approved a pay increase of 4.
This will result because of additional recruitment and pension costs in a rise of 6.
9 per cent in the IMF s total personnel bill budgeted at Dollars 273m (Pounds 180.
2 per cent from Dollars 804m budgeted for year ending June 30.
Bank and Fund officials said the pay rises were based on comparisons of public and private sector salaries in the US France and Germany collected by Hay Associates a consulting company.
The move at a time when the US plans to freeze federal workers pay and other countries are actually rolling back civil service salaries was attacked by outside critics of the two institutions as well as by some inside the two institutions.
Considering that the donor countries are financing an institution that is not performing well to pat themselves on the back and give themselves a raise is not the thing to do said Ms Peggy Hallward of Probe International an environmental group that has criticised many World Bank projects in the developing world.
We can t restrain our appetites added one Bank official.
The World Bank and IMF pay rise also follows a week of intense criticism of lavish spending at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development a similar multilateral financial institution.
Mr Norman Lamont the UK chancellor of the exchequer and Mr Theo Waigel the German finance minister have raised questions about EBRD salaries travel and office expenses.
Opponents of the pay rise believe it is particularly unfortunate because it could increase hostility in the US Congress towards funding the US commitment to give Dollars 3.
75bn for the 10th replenishment of the International Development Association a World Bank offshoot which provides loans at concessional rates to the poorest developing countries.
25bn for the first tranche of this commitment in its budget for 1994.
Officials from the Bank and the Fund said this year s pay rise reflected historical data.
The US pay freeze would show up in next year s calculations.
They also noted that they had to pay competitive salaries to ensure their ability to recruit internationally adding that staff who moved to Washington often came with spouses who had to give up jobs in their home countries.
Both the Bank and the Fund have often been criticised in the past for adding subsidies perquisites and substantial travel expenses to already generous salaries.
Neither institution would provide salary figures but independent guesses estimate the average for the World Bank group s 7 000 employees at over Dollars 70 000 a year and for the 2 200 IMF staff at around Dollars 80 000 a year.
Since non US citizens are not subject to tax equivalent taxable salaries would be much higher.
Mr Lewis Preston president of the World Bank and Mr Michel Camdessus managing director of the IMF earn Dollars 190 000 a year plus a representational allowance of Dollars 95 000 salaries which were substantially increased in 1991 at Mr Camdessus s insistence to retain parity with Mr Jacques Attali president of the EBRD.
Criticism of the World Bank has been particularly barbed because of its role in helping poor developing nations.
FT 27 APR 93 Oxfam wants urgent Marshall Plan for Africa.
West attacked for lacking political will while IMF World Bank policies hurt but do not work.
OXFAM yesterday called on the west to back a Marshall Plan for sub Saharan Africa warning that without greater assistance the region s economic crisis is set to deepen.
Africa is on a knife edge Mr David Bryer director of the Oxford based charity told the London launch of its Africa recovery programme.
The end of the Cold War fragile peace in Ethiopia Eritrea and Mozambique and the emergence of more representative governments in Africa provided the opening for a western initiative said Mr Bryer adding.
to support the current opportunities for recovery or to sentence the region to a spiralling and agonising decline.
But unless the opportunity were seized prospects were bleak Mr Bryer warned.
Economic stagnation social breakdown decaying infrastructures crippling debt burdens ruinous prices for commodity exports and environmental degradation threaten to retard Africa s development prospects into the next century with frightening consequences for human welfare.
Without recovery more than 300m people half the region s population will be living in poverty by the end of the decade.
The report accuses the west of lacking the political will contrasting the response to problems of eastern Europe and Russia with their neglect for over a decade of Africa s far deeper problems.
Some of Oxfam s sharpest criticism is directed at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank arguing that their policies are hurting but not working.
The Fund s increasingly damaging role stems from policy mistakes in the early 1980s says the report.
The Fund treated what was a problem of insolvency as one of short term liquidity extending short term loans at high interest rates to cover structural and trade deficits.
The Fund embarked on financing what was bound to be a slow process of adjustment and recovery with the wrong resources and the wrong approach.
Africa has been paying the price ever since.
It is time for northern governments to face up to the fact that the IMF has failed Africa.
The time has come either fundamentally to reform the IMF or extricate it from Africa.
The report calls for a write off or concessional rescheduling of much of the region s external debt.
Total external debt in 1992 was Dollars 183bn (Pounds 116bn) including IMF and World Bank debt Dollars 30bn higher than in 1989 when large scale cancellations began.
Multilateral agencies mainly the World Bank and IMF accounted for 36 per cent of debt servicing payments in 1991.
Neither agency under existing rules is permitted to reschedule or write off debt.
Tackling the debt burden would be central to Oxfam s five point recovery programme which urges western governments to treat Africa with the same sense of urgency and concern that prompted the Marshall Plan.
Under the plan launched at the end of the second world war the US transferred some 2 per cent of its gross national product to support the rebuilding of post war Europe.

WHEN OXFAM one of Britain s leading aid agencies warns that Africa s economic crisis has put the continent on a knife edge the world should take note.
From Ethiopia in the mid 1980s to Somalia in the 1990s Oxfam and other non government organisations have sounded alarm bells that have aroused public opinion and jolted western governments out of complacency or indifference.
This time says Oxfam the continent not just a country is in jeopardy.
If its fledgling democracies are to survive and fragile peace agreements are to hold sub Saharan Africa needs more help.
and structural adjustment programmes reformed Oxfam argues in its recovery plan for the region.
Oxfam s proposals would be enhanced by a more detached and comprehensive examination of the causes of Africa s crisis.
western governments which spend too much on defence and too little on aid.
industrialised nations which defend protectionist trade regimes.
A markedly more cautious and inhibited approach characterises Oxfam s analysis of Africa s shortcomings past and present.
Zaire s Mobutu and Malawi s Banda are roundly and rightly condemned.
but there is no appraisal for example of ex president Julius Nyerere s disastrous pursuit of African socialism in Tanzania.
Harmful omissions The report is right to note that the slump in world commodity prices has cost Africa dearly.
But it overlooks the fact that domestic policy failures caused Africa s share of the market to fall.
These omissions undermine Oxfam s assertion that the structural adjustment policies urged on Africa by the World Bank and the IMF have not halted the continent s decline.
Its analysis suggests that this failure is almost entirely the fault of the doctor and has little to do with the behaviour of the patient.
Yet in Nigeria and Kenya World Bank supported reforms have been undermined by vested interests and endemic corruption.
Oxfam barely touches on Africa s compelling need to attract foreign investment.
The rate of return on foreign investment dropped from around 30 per cent in the 1960s to 2.
Today Africa s share of global foreign direct investment is 0.
Alarming symptoms Whatever the dispute about the cure however the symptoms of the disease are alarming.
The external debt crisis is getting worse not better while rescheduling has done little more than prolong the agony.
Africa s debt was Dollars 56bn in 1980 29 per cent of GNP.
Twelve years later further enervated by war and drought it owes Dollars 180bn over 100 per cent of annual gross national product.
The IMF and the Bank are hard pressed to find an African country where structural adjustment has led to a sustained recovery that has not been supported by continuing aid.
The average tariff on cocoa beans an important African export is only 2.
Such tariff escalation reinforces Africa s dependence on primary commodities by discouraging investment in local processing.
However serious the constraints imposed by an unfavourable external environment there can be no excuse for the way that Oxfam underplays domestic shortcomings.
This may have something to do with the fact that it has to live with the governments it criticises.
But the report s inhibited treatment of Africa s faults suggests some members of Oxfam are still fighting under the banner of a discredited ideology reluctant to surrender a vision that harks back to the heyday of African socialism.
But to the extent that its assessment of structural adjustment is inadequate the alternatives it proposes lose credibility.
If Oxfam allows erring African governments to avoid shouldering their share of the blame for the continent s crisis it does a disservice to Africa s citizens.
FT 29 APR 93 Reforms planned to improve success rate.
THE World Bank will introduce reforms to try to reverse a steady deterioration in the success rate of its projects Mr Lewis Preston the bank s president said yesterday.
Mr Preston was referring to the findings of an internal review of project performance by a task force headed by Mr Willi Wapenhans a senior bank official.
The Wapenhans report which the bank has not yet published found a gradual but steady deterioration in the World Bank s portfolio performance.
The number of projects judged unsatisfactory at completion had risen from 15 per cent in fiscal 1981 to 30.
It said problems were concentrated in Africa and Latin America but other regions also had 30 40 per cent of problem projects in their 4 5 year old portfolios.
Mr Preston said he was disturbed by the report because it meant implementation of bank projects was not what it should be.
However he said critics misunderstood the meaning of the failure rate.
It was high partly because the bank set an ambitious standard for success.
Projects that failed to meet this criteria need not be a failure in terms of development.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen US treasury secretary underscored the point in congressional testimony this week and said he would press for prompt remedial action.
Make or Break report ( Diagnosing Africa s ills April 29) is right to point to the past and present policy failures of some African governments.
Misguided economic policies autocracy endemic corruption and armed conflict have been part of the lethal cocktail which threatens to consign the region s citizens to deepening poverty.
This is why northern governments should encourage the moves towards democratisation peace and economic policy realism now taking place in many African countries with a Marshall plan for recovery.
Seven years after the Group of Seven industrial countries grudgingly accepted the need for debt relief the world s poorest region is being drained of Dollars 10bn annually.
There can be no moral or economic justification for this especially in the wake of the massive debt relief measures agreed for Russia.
This is why Oxfam is calling on Britain to press for a new initiative on African debt at the G7 summit in July.
Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) implemented by African governments under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF have failed to create a platform for economic recovery and even more conspicuously to address the challenge of poverty alleviation.
The World Bank s own most recent review confirmed that SAPs have a particularly bad record in terms of restoring investment the yardstick against which recovery prospects must be measured.
In part this can be traced to the impact of deflationary monetary policies and sweeping trade liberalisation measures under SAPs.
These have exposed fragile but potentially competitive manufacturing industries to increased competition in the face of spiralling interest rates and rising import costs.
The predictable result has been disinvestment de industrialisation and mounting unemployment.
Rather than apportion blame between doctor and patient surely it is time to recognise that both are hooked on the wrong medicine.
It is time for the World Bank and IMF to surrender their dogmatic attachment to an outmoded set of economic prescriptions.
What is needed is a new approach to adjustment based on redistribution policies selective import liberalisation more carefully phased market reforms and above all a commitment to increased investment in human capital.
Stewart Wallis overseas director Oxfam 274 Banbury Road Oxford OX2 7DZ FT 06 MAY 93 World Bank loan check plan rejected.
WORLD BANK shareholder countries have sent management back to the drawing board to produce a new set of measures for improving the implementation and supervision of loans.
Executive directors representing the member countries rejected a first draft action plan called Next Steps as an inadequate response to a commission s report which documented an alarming deterioration in the performance of the World Bank s loan portfolio.
The commission was chaired by Mr Willi Wapenhans.
We worked closely with other member countries in determining that the first response was not satisfactory and we joined with the others in sending management back to the drawing board for further work Mr Lawrence Summers the US Treasury under secretary in charge of international affairs told a House of Representatives committee yesterday.
We made clear that the initial response went insufficiently far to respond to concerns about the need for more adequate supervision of bank projects and much more emphasis on implementation rather than on approval of loans he said.
The Wapenhans report said that more than 75 per cent of World Bank projects showed acceptable performance but noted a steady deterioration in portfolio performance.
The proportion of projects with significant problems rose from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent in 1991.
The World Bank has been caught in the unfavourable spotlight cast in recent weeks on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development its sister multilateral bank.
Some members of Congress are treating the administration s request for funds for the International Development Association the concessional loan arm of the World Bank with as little enthusiasm as they are showing for EBRD funding.
But the Clinton administration although at first hesitant about the size of the IDA contribution negotiated by its predecessor is throwing its weight behind the request involving a Dollars 1.

Plans at the World Bank for improving its project management.
THE World Bank will next week hold three days of discussions on reforms that could radically alter the way the Washington based development institution operates.
Executive directors representing the shareholder countries will discuss working papers proposing steps to halt the decline in the quality of the bank s loan portfolio policies for disclosure of information and the establishment of an inspection panel to review complaints from the public about bank funded projects.
Some of the changes result from several months of argument and soul searching among managers and directors of the bank provoked by a report last year from Mr Willi Wapenhans a former senior bank official on the deterioration in the quality of the bank s portfolio.
The Wapenhans report said that more than 75 per cent of World Bank projects showed acceptable performance but warned that the proportion of projects with big problems had risen from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent in 1991.
Bank managers and directors have also been acutely anxious to avoid any repetition of their debacle over the Narmada dam project in India.
Sustained criticism of the project from local activists and environmental groups around the world forced the bank to appoint an independent commission whose damning findings eventually led India to withdraw its request for bank funding.
neither the board nor the president want more surprises about problems with on going projects says the draft paper on the establishment of an inspection panel circulated within the bank.
But the internal debate has been sharpened and greatly accelerated by the prodding of the US Congress in the person of Mr Barney Frank the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee which oversees international development issues.
Mr Frank s lever is that he controls the legislation to authorise Washington s Dollars 3.
5bn) contribution to the International Development Association the World Bank affiliate which provides concessional interest rate loans to the poorest countries.
In negotiations with the World Bank and the US Treasury Mr Frank has implicitly although not publicly made the IDA contribution conditional on improvements in the bank s disclosure and appeals procedures.
The documents produced for next week s board discussions are still viewed as inadequate by the environmental groups that have been at the forefront of demands for greater transparency in World Bank operations.
They also fall short in some respects of the understanding US officials thought they had reached in their negotiations with the bank.
Nevertheless they go much further than before in meeting demands from environmentalists and shareholder governments for greater transparency.
The draft papers propose two options for the setting up of an inspection process.
One idea raised by the Dutch and German executive directors is for a single inspector who would not only investigate outside complaints but also review a random sample of bank projects.
A second proposal would involve three independent inspectors reviewing only projects about which complaints had been received.
While there are still questions about details such as budgets and the publication of inspection reports the second proposal seems likely to prove broadly satisfactory to the US Congress.
The draft paper on disclosure however raises more problems.
Although the bank proposes publishing final staff appraisal reports on projects and final country reports early information on projects would be available only in specially prepared Project Information Briefs.
Critics led by the Environmental Defence Fund have circulated comments insisting on the publication of early project documents not fairy tale versions of them.
The third paper Next Steps is designed to follow up the Wapenhans report with measures to improve portfolio performance.
An earlier version was dismissed by shareholder countries as inadequate and the new document attempts to offer stronger measures to shift the bank s corporate culture away from one in which employees are rewarded for approving ever greater volumes of loans towards one which focuses on implementation.
Next Steps introduces portfolio performance reviews for each borrower country but also promises changes in personnel practices to increase the importance attached to portfolio management in staff reviews and promotions.
It is hardly possible to over emphasise the importance of these incentives to reinforce the change in culture towards implementation says the document.
It argues that reversing the decline in the quality of the portfolio must be given the highest priority in the bank s agenda.
COMPANIES in eastern Europe and Russia see poor telecommunications as their main infrastructure barrier to exports according to a survey by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development published at an FT conference yesterday.
Among 800 companies in six countries surveyed Russia Lithuania Hungary Romania Poland and Latvia inadequate telecommunications were a more frequent source of complaint than transport links or border crossings.
Among Polish companies telecommunications were rated the single greatest domestic barrier to exports more significant than exchange rates the instability of financial regulation and other infrastructure shortcomings.
Speakers at the FT conference on telecommunications in central and eastern Europe held in Berlin claimed that investment was falling far short of that required to provide a basic service.
Mr Andres Bande president of Ameritech International the US operator was highly critical of the World Bank in its support for telecommunications investment in the region.
4bn) a year was needed over the next decade to take the number of phone lines from 12 per 100 people to the current level in Spain 35 lines per 100.
6bn was invested and his projections for the rest of the decade were way short of the target.
Mr Alexander Aleshin Russia s first deputy minister for telecommunications said Russia wanted to double its number of exchange lines by the year 2000.
He stressed the problems created by inadequate revenue from fees despite the deregulation of prices.
Mr Krzysztof Kilian Poland s minister of telecommunications said his government wanted to reform Poland s telecommunication law to encourage foreign investment.
But he ruled out the introduction of competition in trunk lines and stressed the political problems of privatisation and revised tariff structures needed to make investment more attractive.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch Germany s minister of posts and telecommunications said privatisation of Deutsche Telekom legislation for which is to be introduced in the German parliament later this year was necessary in part to leave Telekom completely free in the international sphere.
The OECD research also highlighted the high costs and financial insecurity faced by operators in the former eastern bloc.
It found an average of nearly 18 employees per 1 000 main lines in eastern Europe compared with an OECD average of 7 per 1 000.
Privatisation of Deutsche Telekom is likely to take place in four or five steps beginning in late 1995 or 1996 Mr Botsch told the conference.
He wanted network modernisation to be a prime beneficiary of receipts from the sale but he had not yet discussed this with Mr Theo Waigel the finance minister.
FT 12 JUL 93 World Bank to sharpen its focus on cutting poverty.
THE WORLD Bank will today unveil a strategy to overhaul its management priorities and halt an alarming decline in the quality of projects in its loan portfolio.
The move is in response to a growing debate over the effectiveness of the world s multilateral development banks the US in particular pressing for more effective use of its contributions.
Executive directors representing the Bank s shareholder countries agreed last week on a programme entitled Next Steps to remedy some of the problems highlighted last year by an investigative taskforce chaired by Mr Willi Wapenhans a former senior Bank official.
Representatives from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations rejected an earlier draft of the programme as inadequate.
But during three days of board meetings last week the directors agreed that the document was now as close as we are going to get in the words of one official.
The programme coupled with moves to improve the transparency of the World Bank s operations by increasing disclosure and instituting an independent inspection panel could have far reaching effects on the way the Washington based development institution does business.
Next Steps attempts to shift the World Bank s focus away from how much money it lends each year towards its mission to reduce poverty in the developing world through changes in review processes and career incentives.
There will in future be more emphasis on detailed country reviews which will provide a framework for individual project loans.
Promotions will also be based on how well projects perform and not as in the past on the number and size of loans negotiated by staff.
While commitment levels and the size of resource transfers cannot be ignored the ultimate test of the Bank s operations is the actual performance of Bank financed programmes including their long term development impact on our clients and particularly on the poorest segments of their populations the Next Steps document says.
The Wapenhans report revealed alarming problems with the Bank s follow through on loans.
the proportion of projects in the World Bank s Dollars 138bn (Pounds 92bn) portfolio showing big problems nearly doubled from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent a decade later.
Projects were taking an average of 2 1 2 years longer to complete than Bank staff estimated at the outset.
Environmental groups have already criticised the Next Steps programme for focusing too much on financial accountability and too little on improving the actual development impact of the Bank s lending.
Discussions on disclosure during last week s board meetings also made considerable progress and a final document will be prepared over the summer.
The creation of an inspection panel has proved more controversial but a final paper is expected to be drafted by the World Bank s annual meeting in September.
Executive directors are leaning towards an appeals commission to respond to complaints from local citizens and environmental and human rights groups but insist the commission must be answerable to the board.
This is likely to disappoint outside critics of the bank who have argued that a wholly independent panel is needed.
However the measures are expected to satisfy the US government which has played a critical role in prodding the Bank towards new policies on disclosure and appeals.

FT 13 JUL 93 Action plan for World Bank.
THE World Bank has increased its budget for supervision activities by 12 per cent for the current year as part of its efforts to improve the effectiveness of its lending.
Mr Ernest Stern a World Bank managing director and acting president while Mr Lewis Preston the president is recovering from surgery said yesterday the new action plan agreed at a board meeting last week would accelerate a cultural change within the bank and should help to improve the management of the 1 850 projects in its portfolio.
Central to the plan is the commitment to make the management of projects under implementation as important as making new loans.
Only sound on the ground results the development impact of projects are true measures of the bank s contribution to sustainable development Mr Stern said.
The new action plan comes in response to last year s report by a taskforce which identified a sharp decline in the quality of the bank s portfolio with particular problems in Africa and in the agricultural sector.
At the heart of the plan is a determination to manage the bank s portfolio of projects within each country as a unit instead of project by project.
Mr Stern said country reviews would in future be conducted annually for big borrower countries and on a regular basis for smaller borrowers.
Over half of the bank s biggest country portfolios however have already undergone review and as a result a number of projects have been cancelled or redesigned.
In India a review led to the cancellation of projects totalling Dollars 1.
Mr Stern insisted however that the basic responsibility for ensuring that projects were properly implemented lay with the borrower not the bank.
With a portfolio of Dollars 140bn invested in 1 800 projects and programmes it is too powerful for that.
But to win that respect it must be both open and tough open about its failures tough on its shareholders and most of all itself.
With its agenda for improving development effectiveness the bank is taking steps in the right direction.
The bank s prime aim of poverty reduction can in the words of its president Mr Lewis Preston be attained only by restoring or accelerating economic growth and by focusing on policies and programmes that specifically benefit the poor.
The bank tries to turn such benign intentions into reality via its lending.
To Mr Preston s credit he decided to find out how well the bank s lending was working.
The proportion of operations in progress that had major problems had risen from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent a decade later.
The bank s Operations Evaluations Department judged only 63 per cent of completed operations to be satisfactory in 1991 a sharp decline from the 85 per cent achieved in 1981.
It would be easy for the bank to improve its performance by avoiding innovative risky or complex projects particularly in the poorest countries.
Furthermore many failures are to be explained by adverse global developments such as deteriorating terms of trade and high real interest rates.
Also important has been the poor state of many borrowers economies.
The debt crisis inflicted serious damage for example though these difficulties usually reflected and in turn contributed to wider economic mismanagement.
Nevertheless the bank does bear much of the blame.
It is simultaneously a financial intermediary a dispenser of largesse and a supplier of advice.
In practice effectiveness has too often been subordinated to the desire to expand lending and remain on good terms with clients who are also shareholders.
The bank s proposed solutions are to move the management of country portfolios to centre stage in its dialogue with borrowers.
It also aims to redirect internal incentives towards rewarding successful progress in projects from project approval.
Similarly it cannot give countries honest and effective government.
What the bank can do is decide whether a particular government or borrower is worthy of support.
If the conditions for effective use of resources do not exist the bank must walk away explaining clearly both to the client and to a wider audience why it has decided to do so.
The bank needs to see an informed public opinion as its friend.
But many in both developed and developing countries want the bank to succeed in its prime goal of helping reduce poverty.
They also recognise that developing countries need honest and effective government implementing sensible policy.
FT 16 JUL 93 Red faces at World Bank as HQ costs break budget.
THE World Bank has sent three managers on administrative leave after loose project management pushed the cost of its new headquarters building in Washington Dollars 83.
The the building was now expected to cost around Dollars 290m compared with a 1990 budget of Dollars 206.
However an internal inquiry had concluded that most of the overrun was due to unrealistically low initial estimates.
Cost overruns for large buildings are not uncommon but in this case much of the problem could have been avoided if realistic estimates had been presented at the outset said Mr Ernest Stern who is acting as president while Mr Lewis Preston recovers from surgery.
This was compounded by loose management and a failure to bring problems to the attention of the bank s senior managers on a timely basis.
A bank statement said the inquiry had found that all funds committed to the project had been spent on essential components of what remains a strictly functional building and there is no suggestion of financial impropriety of any kind.
However Mr Sven Sandstrom the World Bank managing director appointed to head the inquiry found that project managers had failed to inform either senior management or board of the cost overruns.
They had also spent Dollars 22m without authorisation on two buildings which are to be refurbished as part of the overall headquarters project.
A second phase inquiry will begin immediately to assess the actions of the managers and appropriate disciplinary measures if any.
The World Bank s construction problems are particularly embarrassing coming as they do on the heels of the furore over the lavish London headquarters built for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Even critics of the World Bank s operating expenses however acknowledge that the new headquarters whose Dollars 123 per square foot construction cost falls within central Washington norms includes none of the expensive marble or frills of the EBRD building.
This is home grown incompetence not imperial arrogance commented one person familiar with the project.
In another sense however the bank s failure to oversee its own project adequately is even more embarrassing because of the institution s long experience of advising borrowers in the developing world on project management and supervision.
The preliminary budget submitted to the board in February 1989 was set at Dollars 186m.
After a design competition and negotiations with the winning architect the budget was revised the following August to Dollars 206.
The bank said yesterday it had ignored independent consultant engineers estimates that the building would cost Dollars 250m in the expectation that low demand in the construction sector and cost saving measures would allow it to stick to the approved budget.
Sir In your otherwise well balanced editorial Improving the World Bank (July 15) there is one important matter on which you let the World Bank off too lightly.
Many failures are to be explained by adverse global developments such as deteriorating terms of trade.
This statement treats the deteriorating terms of trade as entirely an external factor nothing to do with the World Bank.
However some of us think and believe we can prove that the deteriorating terms of trade have a great deal to do with the type of structural adjustment programmes impressed by the World Bank (as well as the International Monetary Fund) upon developing countries.
The pressure towards outward orientation simultaneously exerted upon so many developing countries exporting the same commodity has the predictable outcome of deteriorating terms of trade.
This will also affect countries not directly subject to structural adjustment programmes but competing with countries which are.
The remedy must be for the World Bank (and IMF) to pay greater attention to aggregation problems and abandon their strict and blinkered country by country approach.
It also follows that the world community must pay more attention to macro economic management including stabilisation of commodity prices.

FT 16 AUG 93 World Bank scales down proposals to become more open.
THE WORLD BANK has scaled back plans to increase disclosure of information and to set up an appeals panel to review complaints.
The move has drawn criticism from non governmental groups that have been lobbying for greater transparency in the institution s operations.
Executive directors representing the World Bank s member countries discussed draft policy papers on the disclosure of its studies and reports and the establishment of an inspection panel to review complaints about Bank funded projects last month.
But revised drafts scale down the degree of disclosure and also aim for a more modest inspection panel than once proposed.
In a memorandum attached to the disclosure draft Mr Ernest Stern the World Bank veteran who is running the institution while Mr Lewis Preston the president recovers from surgery says the proposals are based on the judgment that the bank should be more open about its policies and activities and that broader dissemination of information will enhance the quality of our work and strengthen public understanding of it.
However the new draft has eliminated all references to a reform which would have led to the bank obtaining blanket approval from borrower countries for the disclosure of documents relating to them.
Executive directors at last month s board meeting insisted on the need for some confidentiality in order to ensure frank discussion with borrowers and among directors.
Mr Stern says in his memorandum that the proposed disclosure procedures will maintain the presumption of disclosure while providing the governments concerned an opportunity to review appraisal country economic and sector reports and identify specific issues of confidentiality.
Blanket clearance has been a core demand for advocates of greater transparency including both environmentalists and campaigners for democracy in areas such as Africa where governments rarely disclose much information to their citizens.
While environmentalists criticised the case by case disclosure policy the new policy would nevertheless expand the categories of document made public by the World Bank.
Staff appraisal reports on individual projects reviews of the overall economy or of specific sectors in member countries and summaries of audits by the operations evaluation department would be made available.
However a new project information document intended to give advance information on projects being considered for bank financing is viewed by environmentalist groups as inadequate.
Environmentalist groups are particularly critical of a proposal that the panel s findings should only be made public after the bank board had decided on them too late for the plaintiff to have much influence on the decision.
However it seems likely that executive directors will agree to the disclosure policy at a board meeting on August 26.
FT 19 AUG 93 World Bank move on plan to monitor projects.
THE World Bank board will meet next week to discuss proposals for setting up an inspection panel to review complaints about projects from executive directors or outside groups.
But the draft paper circulated to directors before the meeting suggests a modest unit with an annual budget of only Dollars 600 000 (Pounds 402 700) and a single permanent though not necessarily full time staff member.
The suggested annual budget is almost exactly half of that required for a single independent commission set up under Mr Bradford Morse former administrator of the United Nations Development Project to investigate the World Bank funded Narmada dam project in India.
The furore over Narmada was a driving force behind many World Bank directors desire to set up some form of inspection panel.
Criticism of the draft paper especially from environmental groups which have led the battle against projects such as Narmada focuses on the limits proposed on the panel s independence on the restricted scope of complaints it could investigate and on the publication of the panel s verdict.
Complaints could be brought either by any four executive directors or by a directly affected third party but in the latter case the board would decide whether to proceed with an investigation.
Environmentalist groups also complain that investigations would be limited to violations of the World Bank s own policies rules and procedures.
They would not be allowed for violations by a borrower country of its loan agreements with the World Bank.
In most cases critics of the paper argue the bank follows procedures in drawing up its loan agreements insisting on very adequate environmental and human rights safeguards.
the problem arises when those safeguards are not put into effect by the borrower.
A further criticism is the draft paper s proposal that the panel s judgement should only be released to the complainant after the World Bank board had already taken a decision on what to do about it too late for the complainant to have any input into the remedy.
A separate draft paper on expanding the disclosure of World Bank information is also due to be discussed but is at a more advanced stage and could be concluded that day.
The inspection panel document is likely to be reworked and concluded shortly before the bank s annual meeting at the end of next month.
FT 28 AUG 93 World Bank approves greater transparency.
WORLD Bank executive directors have approved a new information policy that will make many more of its documents available to the public.
Project appraisal reports summaries of internal evaluations country economic reports and sectoral policy papers will in most cases be published usually only with the consent of the country involved and after the bank s board has acted on them.
Critics of the Washington based international development bank especially environmental groups which have long criticised it for financing projects such as dams and power stations in the developing world still have vigorous complaints about the new policy especially as it steps back in some regards from a draft circulated a few weeks earlier.
It s totally inadequate said Ms Lori Udall of the Environmental Defence Fund.
Bank officials insist however that the policy is a genuine attempt to achieve greater transparency.
We are doing more than any international organisation has ever done to open up.
Many environmentalists agree that it will in fact take transparency a step further.
It is clearly better than nothing acknowledged one persistent critic.
Intentionally and unintentionally the World Bank is already far less secretive than the International Monetary Fund its sister institution.
even supposedly confidential documents circulate widely in Washington.
One significant step in the new policy is the creation of a public information centre to open next January which will greatly ease public access in the borrowing countries where information is most scarce.
Critics of the new policy say too many documents will only be published after the bank has taken its decision too late for the public to influence the debate.
Environmentalists are particularly harsh about the Project Information Document a new summary intended to give early information on loans the Bank is considering.
A sample PID circulated this month did not even disclose where the shrimp fisheries it discussed were to be located although this was rectified in an embarrassed addendum last week.

the lingering legacy of the colonial era the harsh dictates of World Bank structural adjustment programmes the miserly aid and restrictive trade policies of developed country governments and the kleptocratic tendencies of Africa s own governing elite.
So called Afro pessimists and their gloomy appraisals make an easier target for those who are reluctant to confront the true dimensions of Africa s crisis.
After a dozen years of structural adjustment and more than Dollars 170bn in net development assistance the sub Saharan economy is still falling behind.
1 per cent a year between 1982 and 1992 compared to an average rise of 0.
4 per cent in the east Asia developing countries.
The outlook is far from encouraging as the accompanying articles demonstrate throughout this survey.
Institutional and infrastructural decline is accelerating the number of countries facing political disintegration is growing and the Aids crisis is deepening.
The aid keeps flowing although sub Saharan Africa cannot be sure that its share of global aid up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970 will continue to rise.
But Africa is increasingly cut off from the rest of the world economy there is little evidence to suggest that either returning flight capital or foreign investment can fill the gap between Africa s capital needs and its ability to generate domestic savings.
The combination of half hearted policy reform some debt relief and substantial aid is expected to continue to slow the pace rather than reverse the direction of this relative and absolute decline.
The World Bank expects African real incomes per head to rise by 0.
6 per cent a year over the next decade compared to 2.
Still as the World Bank rightly says the gloom can be overdone.
Across the continent human development indicators have improved over the past two decades.
Infant mortality has fallen from 137 per 1 000 live births in 1973 to 107 in 1991 while life expectancy has risen from 45 years to 51 years over the same period.
Progress on these social measures of quality of life was made in the 1980s despite adverse shifts in Africa s terms of trade volatile commodity prices persisting protectionism in OECD countries and the doubling over 10 years in the the share of Africa s export earnings which go to service debts.
Moreover the World Bank can correctly claim that the nature of the obstacles to economic progress in Africa is now better understood.
Ten years ago African governments defended to the death fixed exchange rates administered prices state ownership of industry subsidies to parastatals cheap food for urban workers and negative real interest rates while the private sector was regarded with suspicion.
Now most governments accept at least in principle that establishing macro economic stability through structural adjustment policies cutting budget deficits slowing inflation and monetary growth establishing a competitive exchange rate and eliminating obstacles to exports is necessary if their economies are to achieve self sustaining economic growth.
The World Bank can point to signs of success in the handful of countries which has taken the structural adjustment advice to heart most notably Ghana but also Uganda Burkina Faso and until recently Malawi as evidence that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for progress.
Since Ghana s adjustment programme began its gross domestic product has grown by an average of 4.
9 per cent a year over twice the sub Saharan average of 2.
Equally powerfully the Bank can point to the deepening recessions in the member countries of the French African Community (CFA) zone to demonstrate that governments cannot pick and mix items from the adjustment agenda.
Between 1986 and 1991 cumulative losses in competitiveness cut the output of the CFA countries by an average of 0.
GDP in the other 16 African countries which the Bank classifies as adjusters rose by an average 4.
5 per cent a year over the same period compared to a fall of 0.
2 per cent annually in the first half of the decade.
First most African governments have not been willing to pay more than lip service to the need for structural adjustment.
Second the experience of those countries which have tried to keep to the spirit as well as the letter of World Bank programmes suggests that structural adjustment is far from sufficient to deliver sustainable economic growth.
In country after country the political commitment to economic reform has not been maintained.
Of 26 adjusting countries in 1990 91 only one Ghana was judged by the World Bank research department to have an adequate macro economic policy stance.
In another 14 the stance was found to be fair while in the remaining 11 it was rated either poor or very poor.
One reason that adjustment is hard to sustain is that it takes many years to deliver results much longer than the World Bank and the IMF were originally prepared to admit.
But the deeper problem is that economic reform invariably runs counter to the interests of the urban elites who dominate government in Africa.
Many African rulers are politically dependent on the patronage and corruption which regulations and secrecy conceal and which reforms are designed to root out.
Kenya and Nigeria are prime examples of countries whose governments in spite of the glaring need for adjustment have never been able to maintain the reform momentum for long too many powerful Nigerians benefit from the rewards that a distorted foreign exchange market deliver to those with a banking licence.
Ghana by contrast has sustained adjustment in part because its military government consistently aligned its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer urban elite which probably stands to lose more from adjustment in the early stages.
The rural vote secured the election of Flight Lt Jerry Rawlings as president last December.
The donors have rightly come under fire for their willingness to conceal what they know of the activities of African governments.
For all its talk of good governance the World Bank has never been willing to require that its client governments observe minimum levels of transparency accountability and access to information or apply these tests to its own dealings with African governments.
The Bank often finds itself standing between unsuccessful governments and their electorates and withholding vital information on the state of the economy and presenting overly optimistic progress reports that do no service to the reform cause.
In Nigeria the World Bank remains willing to conceal the extent to which the government siphons off an estimated 200 000 barrels of oil a day for its own off budget purposes.
In Zimbabwe Bank officials recently submitted wildly optimistic export and growth numbers to their executive board to support a loan application.
But the shortcomings of African governments and the unwillingness of Bank officials to disclose unpalatable facts are only part of the story.
The absence of political instability and corruption and the adoption of the full adjustment agenda is not it seems enough to deliver a significant growth take off.
In a handful of cases there has been an impressive supply side response.
The Mauritian miracle is the most convincing but the response of farmers and textile manufacturers in Nigeria of clothing exporters in Zimbabwe and tourist operators in Kenya and Tanzania all reflect only partial success.
One reason is that the non farm private sector is too small to exploit the new opportunities.
Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990 compared to 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per cent in rapidly growing Thailand.
Across Africa the private sector is dominated by a handful of multinationals and hundreds of small scale enterprises.
Those medium sized companies which do exist are primarily service orientated and often dependent on the regulations and tariff walls that adjustment policies dismantle.
The post 1970 deterioration in commodity prices the increasing need for skilled rather than merely plentiful and cheap labour and the increased emphasis on short lead times and quality over cost all make it harder for Africa to sell itself as a location for foreign direct investment.
Even successful adjusters have not shed the reputation of being high risk low return locations.
Africa does not have the social and physical infrastructure requirements that multinationals increasingly demand.
Standards of literacy lag behind those of the east Asian developing economies while the public infrastructure education and health systems have deteriorated across the continent.
Even when governments are getting macroeconomic policies right implementation on the ground in the central bank at the tax office at the customs desk is proving much more difficult.
The reason acknowledged in a recent speech by the Bank s vice president for Africa Mr Kim Jaycox is the region s deteriorating institutional capacity.
The Bank group lends Dollars 4bn a year to sub Saharan Africa but has Dollars 14bn waiting to be dispersed.
The World Bank now concedes that some of its performance yardsticks a reduction in the number of public servants on the payroll are not meaningful indicators of policy reform.
Laying off road workers makes little impact on the wage bill has no impact at all on administrative efficiency and invariably means increased road maintenance charges later.
Reducing the role of the state has left a vacuum filled in many instances by the donors and non governmental organisations.
In reality the shift of control in Africa is not from the state to the private sector or to the market but to the donors.
Aid dependence has become aid addiction.
Mr Jaycox argues that by substituting expatriate management for domestic skills donors are systematically destroying capacity that does exist.
This is much worse than it sounds given the long lead time necessary to rebuild that capacity.
The result is a disturbing contradiction between the desire for private sector and market oriented development and the intrusive role the agencies frequently play in project decision making.
An alarmingly high proportion of the region s investment decisions are made by aid workers rather than the private sector.
Given a healthier global environment a more robust OECD growth performance adoption of the Uruguay Round proposals firmer commodity prices fewer droughts and an end to war and civil unrest an acceleration in the sub Saharan growth towards 5 per cent a year from 2 per cent over the past decade is within reach.
Whether the majority of African countries can achieve even this modest growth rate will depend on the willingness of African governments to pursue the right policies and on the incentives that the developed country donors can offer to persuade governments to put long term development before political short termism.
The failures of the 1980s suggest that the west in seeking ways to speed rather than impede development must make a much clearer and public distinction between those governments which truly embrace reform and those which merely pay lip service.
That means offering greater rewards to those countries such as Ghana Uganda and Zambia which are demonstrating a sustained commitment to reform while taking a tougher stance towards those countries such as Kenya and Nigeria which continue to evade responsibility for their failures.
humanitarian intervention without a political and economic framework for recovery is at best short term relief and at worst compounds the disaster.
Trade aid and debt relief are the best ways to encourage success.
Ghana s ability to sustain reform over the past decade is due in large part to the fact that annual gross aid flows averaging 8 per cent of GDP were available almost from the moment that reform began.
But it is absurd that Ghana should at the same time be paying a third of its annual export earnings in debt service to bilateral and multilateral donors.
The Ghanaian government will not request debt relief even though it clearly qualifies for debt reduction for fear that these aid flows will dry up.
But the donors should be offering to Ghana and other successful adjusters much more generous packages of aid and debt relief.
The international aid community must also think hard about the ways their activities help and hinder development in successful adjusters.
The slow pace of indigenous capacity building means that the need for external institutional support will remain for decades.
There is a strong case for more burden sharing between the donors and agencies starting with a greater and more formalised role for non government organisations (NGOs) working with local communities in areas such as primary health and education which are so important if sustainable growth is to be achieved.
But the World Bank and the donors need radically to re assess their approach to the numerous African governments who merely flirt with economic reform.
The 1980s evidence suggests that trying to force adjustment measures on unwilling and corrupt regimes is counter productive.
First the World Bank resident representative and visiting firemen tend to become the regime s apologist increasingly willing to answer local critics and justify and defend ill designed adjustment policies on the government s behalf.
Then the Bank and the IMF become useful scapegoats when flawed and partially implemented policies do not deliver results a tactic that President Moi of Kenya and ex Presidents Kaunda of Zambia and Nyerere of Tanzania have all exploited.
To avoid this trap the Bank must insist that reform programmes are home grown rather than imposed from outside something which Ghana s achievements show is difficult but possible.
The donors must meanwhile be prepared to put political reform at the top of the agenda.
What is needed is not necessarily a change in government but rather a change in the style of government towards more open and accountable policy formulation and debate.
Enforcing good governance requirements is much more demanding and arguably far more important than requiring multi party elections as a pre condition for aid.
without the defeat of Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections Zambia would probably not have become the country with one of the best macro economic records in the region.
But Ghana s successful transition to civilian rule occurred in part because the military government was able to build an impressive track record over a 10 year period before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn s elections.
An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very different result.
But there is nothing democratic or economically progressive about multi party elections unless minimum standards of good governance are already achieved.
Last year s elections did not persuade President arap Moi of Kenya to put past patronage policies aside and embrace accountability and transparency.
Nigeria s disastrous and flawed transition to civilian rule shows how multi party elections can become an excuse for not taking tough economic decisions.
Africa s debt burden further complicates the strategy as the Nigerian experience again illustrates.
Without debt relief Africa s most populous country has little hope of progress a point that World Bank officials make with great force.
But the Paris Club creditors remain unwilling to offer further relief to a government which consistently misuses the resources it does control.
Across Africa the carrot of debt relief has not been enough to persuade half hearted adjusters to accelerate reform the World Bank is right to argue that a substantial write off of Africa s remaining debts on more generous terms than are currently envisaged and taking account of differing debt structures is now inevitable and should occur across the board.
But debt relief should be combined with a public statement from the Bank and the donors that for Africa the rules of the aid game have changed.
The Bank and the donors should refuse to engage in policy based lending with any government which does not meet minimum standards of transparency and public access to information including the Bank s own reports.
They must be much tougher about policing and enforcing the conditions upon which future lending is based including much more rigorous and rapid internal auditing of Bank and IMF lending.
If governments are not willing to embrace the full structural adjustment agenda and good governance requirements then the donors should only finance humanitarian projects.
The World Bank and the donor community must speak out about the true state of Africa.
Telling things as they are means being more realistic about what adjustment programmes can achieve.
It means acknowledging that deregulation and liberalisation are only a beginning that five year programmes are implausibly short and that it will take many years of investment in human and physical infrastructure before the region s institutional base is rehabilitated.
Afro realism means resisting the temptation to declare victory in Ghana or Uganda or to make excuses for the shortcomings of governments in Nigeria and Kenya.
For those countries which take the structural adjustment medicine recovery will be long and hard.
For those that do not the chances of progress are slim and the future looks bleak.
World Bank Global Economic Prospects 1991 and 1993 FT 01 SEP 93 Business and the Environment.
When conservation efforts fail to protect Despite sound funding and noble intentions a project to curb deforestation rates in north west Ecuador has collapsed.
Environmentalists applauded when the Global Environmental Facility was set up three years ago to create a United Nations backed international fund for developing countries.
They saw the GEF as a way for north and south to share responsibility for global environmental problems.
5bn (Pounds 1bn) over three years for projects on protecting the ozone layer international waters and biodiversity and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
Yet earlier this year a proposed GEF project in Ecuador Ecoforest 2000 was dropped because of its controversial social and environmental implications.
Its failure revealed the obstacles in implementing the GEF s objectives and raised questions over the World Bank s role as the administrator of such a fund.
Ecoforest 2000 was conceived as a long term forestry management scheme to minimise deforestation of primary forest by planting tree farms for sustainable use by commercial timber companies.
The tropical rainforest in north west Ecuador has one of the world s highest biodiversity densities but also one of the highest deforestation rates.
It was the first project to be approved by the International Finance Corporation the private sector financial arm of the World Bank using GEF funds.
At first sight a laudable initiative it was soon criticised by local communities and environmental groups.
Many asked why only a single managed timber source was planned as an alternative to existing sources namely the Durini Foundation a family owned lumber group which is one of the wealthiest businesses in Ecuador.
The small landowners were said to have equal or larger environmental importance.
The effect on the indigenous groups was also questioned.
Lorena Gamboa of the environmental group Accion Ecologica criticised the IFC GEF s impact study saying it underestimated the effect of resettling 40 to 50 families toestablish tree farms.
Landless farmers were likely to increase pressure on deforestation and colonisation of virgin forest she claimed.
The GEF s plans to lease lumber rights from indigenous people at extremely low prices in some of the last large tracts of primary forest also proved contentious.
While such concerns were being voiced expectations for the project to meet community needs to lessen acute poverty and enable development of regional infrastructure such as health services and schooling were large.
The IFC GEF s alleged insensitivity to community needs prompted many to question their commitment towards conservation.
Ecociencia for example an ecological research centre says the project failed to provide an alternative for principal agents of deforestation in the area the colonos or settlers.
Colonos subsist on sale of timber or clear land for farming.
Teodoro Bustamante a member of Fundacion Natura Ecuador s largest environmental group says the project s aim of a single and managed timber source in the area was based primarily on commercial principles with conservation only a secondary consideration.
The IFC GEF sponsored review of the project released in March confirmed many of the criticisms and revaluation needs.
Funds were subsequently frozen and a round table talk was scheduled for all those involved.
But before the meeting the IFC delegation announced its withdrawal.
We were all disappointed by the withdrawal says Bustamante and it ridiculed the entire consultation process illustrating that they were not really interested in our input.
The subsequent collapse of the project has cast doubt on the potential for alternatives to the continuing destruction of tropical primary forest in Ecuador.
Environmentalists are left with only bitter reproaches for how the project was handled.
And the failure of the Ecuadorian government to develop a strategy of sustainable forest utilisation and to allocate sufficient resources to the management of forests and protected areas has created a hostile climate for foreign aid to benefit the country s environment.
But others believe one lesson can be learnt from the experience future projects would benefit if environmental groups and local communities were involved in the early design of a project.
The need for this is highlighted by scientific studies showing that the 4 per cent annual deforestation rate will devour tropical forests of north west Ecuador in a decade or two eliminating an estimated five animal species per day.
FT 24 SEP 93 Reform failing in African states.
ECONOMIC reform is failing in sub Saharan Africa and its crisis will deepen unless finance ministers at the IMF World Bank meeting in Washington help resolve the region s crushing external debt burden officials of Oxfam the international aid agency warned yesterday.
After a decade of structural adjustment programmes implemented under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF Africa remains trapped in a downward spiral of economic and social decline and poverty is increasing the agency said in London.
There is now overwhelming evidence that existing adjustment policies have failed in two ways it said.
They have not created a platform for sustainable recovery and have not addressed the central challenge correctly identified by the World Bank of alleviating poverty.
However the Bank s policies suffer from inappropriate design inadequate funding and poor implementation the statement continues.
Some of the sharpest criticism is reserved for the IMF whose role in Africa should be reviewed by an international committee reporting to the United Nations Oxfam said.
Mr Michel Camdessus IMF managing director strongly defended its role in Africa against Oxfam s charges while admitting that the situation in Africa was a matter of immense concern.
But he said there were countries in Africa that were growing ones that had followed IMF economic reform programmes that had allowed increased output and exports.
Countries such as Mozambique Uganda Ghana and Ethiopia were all benefiting from IMF inspired policies.
There was scope for greater regional integration in Africa.
Those countries which had not embarked on structural adjustment programmes must put their macro economic policies in order.
Mr Camdessus said there was much that industrialised countries could do to improve the situation.
Africa would benefit most from early conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
Oxfam says the speed at which IMF programmes require governments to reduce budget deficits is totally unrealistic and destructive.
The statement calls for longer time frames and more selective introduction of trade liberalisation measures.
Debt servicing takes up a quarter of the region s exports although only half of scheduled payments are being met.
Arrears currently exceed Dollars 11bn and are building up at an alarming rate.
Oxfam called on the IMF to create a special fund to write off part of Africa s debt through the sale of gold stocks.
FT 16 MAR 94 Honesty urged over failure in Africa.
A leading British charity yesterday called for an open acknowledgment of the scale of sub Saharan Africa s development fail ure.
In a strongly worded attack on the World Bank s latest report on the region Oxfam said that bank supported structural adjustment programmes had failed to generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty.
The charity which is heavily involved in Africa declared that adjustment programmes were preoccupied with lowering inflation through interest rates and unrealistic money supply targets.
Poorly planned and sequenced import liberalisation measures had exposed potentially competitive local industries to ruinous competition from imports Oxfam said in its statement.
The British charity accused the bank of complacency in the face of what it called Africa s deepening development crisis.
The charity also attacked the bank s classification in its report of Zimbabwe as a successful adjusting country as bordering on outright deception.
Zimbabwe s adjustment programme did not come until operation until 1991 says Oxfam.
Since when there has been no sign of recovery in investment or export growth.
FT 11 APR 94 World Bank to focus on the human cost of aid.
The World Bank plans to strengthen its efforts to help people who are forced out of their homes or farms by the development projects it finances after a year long review of the forced resettlements resulting from its loans.
Mr Ismail Serageldin the World Bank s vice president for environmentally sustainable development said the Washington based development institution had already improved its procedures but would now make sure it agreed with borrowing countries on a complete resettlement programme before a project began.
Over the last seven years the bank has been involved in projects forcibly displacing about 2.
5m people mostly dams and non bank projects have probably displaced more than 30 times as many.
The resettlement review was partly triggered by the bank s involvement in the Narmada dam project in India from which it withdrew last year after months of controversy over its resettlement programmes.
Publication of the resettlement report comes just days before the World Bank board is due to vote on a loan for the Xiaolangdi project in China another controversial dam to be built on the Huang He which will displace 181 000 people.
Mr Serageldin said that China the World Bank s largest borrower was now a model for resettlement because the government had adopted its own policies that concentrate on resettling people in new jobs or land rather than simply compensating them for the property they had lost.
The key lesson is that it works best when governments themselves buy into the idea of people based resettlement not property based resettlement he said.
Outside environmental and development groups however are more critical of the extent of compulsion in China s resettlement programmes and the bank s own report does not back up the idea that it has succeeded in meeting its resettlement goal of restoring or improving the incomes of the displaced populations.
Mortgaging The Earth The World Bank environmental impoverishment and the crisis of development By Bruce Rich Earthscan Publications Pounds 14.
376 pages Fifty years after its creation the World Bank faces a chorus of complaints that the Dollars 24bn worth of loans it makes a year is failing to bring about the kind of economic development it intends.
One of the most frequent accusations is that the bank s projects are also destroying the environment.
That charge was partly acknowledged by the bank last year when it withdrew a proposal to lend India money to build the Narmada dam in Gujarat state west India.
Critics of the Dollars 3bn project to provide electricity and irrigation said it would destroy wildlife habitats and force thousands of people to resettle.
According to Bruce Rich the Narmada episode is just one example in a long list of World Bank projects which have brought ecological devastation.
Rich a campaigner at US lobby group the Environmental Defence Fund is right in his criticism of the bank s lending practices on many counts.
Several World Bank funded schemes have become notorious for their ecological impact.
Road building through the rainforest of north western Brazil accelerated logging of hardwood trees.
the bank then felt obliged to back further projects intended to counteract that damage.
Indonesian transmigration the relocation of people from the western Indonesian islands into the untouched forests of Irian Jaya caused extensive disruption of the island s native communities and of the plants and animals that supported them.
The scheme did not alleviate poverty but simply redistributed it Rich argues.
He is right too in his analysis of some of the causes of these misjudgments.
He points to the bank s preference for projects such as dams road building and irrigation schemes which have environmental and social consequences that are often hard to anticipate.
But he seems misguided in ascribing the bank s failings to a thirst for power and to its official culture of secretiveness.
A sprawling chapter From Descartes to Chico Mendes (who campaigned against Brazil s timber policies) declares that the bank represents a centuries old western tradition of dominating other societies and the natural world.
A better explanation might be that the bank favours large schemes because of the difficulty and expense of gathering information on smaller projects and because of the need to control overheads.
Rich s taste for grandiose pronouncements on cultural trends makes many of his descriptions frustratingly abstract.
To see Singrauli today is to witness a nihilistic negation of nature and humankind he says of one Indian industrial region which hardly conveys what it feels like to be there.
Even where he introduces particular cases of ecological destruction his attacks on the World Bank are frequently imprecise.
For example when talking about the environmental impact of commercial shrimp farming in Thai mangrove swamps he does not say how much tree felling would have happened regardless of the bank s involvement.
However the book s main weakness is that it judges the bank only by an ecological yardstick.
Rich makes no attempt to assess how the bank rates against its own goals of fostering economic development and reducing poverty.
He quotes people who object to projects but does not examine whether other groups or the countries overall have benefited from the World Bank s presence.
Rich does not give sufficient credit to recent soul searching at the bank including a conference last year on proposals for reforming its lending practices and environmental standards.
After Narmada the bank produced a series of scathing internal reports which concluded neither the board nor the president wants more surprises about problems with ongoing projects.
It becomes clear as Rich rails against the seemingly unstoppable inevitable face of development that he is at heart uncomfortable with the pursuit of economic growth.
As helping countries to grow is one of the bank s central aims it is perhaps inevitable that no World Bank project meets with his approval.
Tellingly he concludes that nature itself appears in revolt against this empire of man over things.
Readers may feel at many points that Rich does not much like people unless they belong to indigenous tribes.
These weaknesses are unfortunate because Rich poses timely questions about the World Bank s role.
Anxieties about whether resources are applied to the most deserving projects and about how success should be measured now confront many of the international institutions set up after the second world war notably the International Monetary Fund the World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency the nuclear watchdog.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development set up in 1991 to help rebuild eastern Europe and modelled partly on the World Bank has grappled with similar issues.
If the World Bank now faces more searching questions about its role than in the past that is not entirely the fault of its lending record.
It also reflects the growing debate about the proper economic and environmental relationship between the developed and developing world.
He is right though to argue that the bank needs to find answers because the questions will not go away.
FT 20 JUN 94 Inefficiency and bad maintenance attacked.
The World Bank is urging a complete reorientation of policy on infrastructure provision in developing countries to shift the focus from building new roads electricity plants and water pipelines towards ensuring such installations provide the service they were designed for.
An extensive analysis of infrastructure issues in the latest edition of the World Bank s annual world development report shows that about Dollars 200bn (Pounds 132bn) a year of infrastructure investment in developing countries has greatly increased access to electricity sanitation paved roads telephones and water.
But inefficiency and poor maintenance have meant that money is wasted and service is patchy.
there has been too much emphasis on the stock of infrastructure built and not enough on the service provided said Mr Lewis Preston the World Bank s president.
The emphasis everywhere must be less on cutting ribbons to open new facilities and more on ensuring that those facilities deliver the intended services he added.
The report notes that spending Dollars 1m to reduce the very high losses of electricity in transmission and distribution networks could save some African countries Dollars 12m in generating capacity while the proportion of water delivered to the field in irrigation projects is typically only 25 30 per cent compared wth 40 45 per cent in the most efficient projects.
World Bank highway projects primarily involving maintenance produce returns that are almost twice as high as those concentrating on new road construction.
But almost Dollars 13bn worth of roads one third of those built in the last 20 years have eroded for lack of maintenance.
Overall the World Bank estimates that technical inefficiency such as leaking water pipes electricity transmission losses and railway overstaffing costs the developing world Dollars 55bn a year.
In addition it calculates that inefficient pricing structures that fail to recover costs fully from users cost developing country governments Dollars 123bn a year.
These inefficiencies cause great hardships not only for the very poor but also for businesses the report says.
A study in Istanbul showed that nearly all households used back up water supply systems such as wells rivers and street vendors because of the unreliability of publicly supplied water.
For the poorest households however these back ups cost 5 per cent of total income while for the richest it was only 1 per cent.
Another survey of 179 businesses in Nigeria showed that more than half owned their own electricity generators an expense which amounted to around 10 per cent of the total machinery and equipment for the largest companies but as much as 25 per cent for the smallest.
Yet because Nigerian regulations prevent the sale of surplus power they operated their generators on average at no more than 25 per cent of capacity.
While efficiency of operation is typically much higher in industrialised countries the report argues that there is nothing inevitable about this.
Although the availability of infrastructure facilities does increase in step with national income the efficiency and quality of service delivered is relatively independent of income that is low income countries can be good performers while chronic waste and inefficiency can be found among middle and even high income countries said Mr Gregory Ingram who headed the team that wrote the report.
The report suggests three ways in which service can be improved.
manage infrastructure like a business not a bureaucracy introduce competition directly if feasible and indirectly if not give users and stakeholders a strong voice and real responsibility.
Analysing 42 developing countries the report found that in those with centralised road maintenance systems one third of unpaved roads and more than 20 per cent of paved roads were in poor condition.
in those with decentralised systems only 15 per cent of unpaved roads and just over 10 per cent of paved roads were in poor condition.
Another study of 121 rural water supply projects in Africa Asia and Latin America showed that of those where participation by the local population was classified as high 83 per cent had good maintenance levels and 81 per cent were graded as effective in achieving their goals.
Of those where participation was low 23 per cent had good maintenance levels and only 8 per cent were graded as effective.
While non governmental development groups applauded the World Bank s call for more emphasis on maintenance and for greater user participation they said that the Bank itself was part of the problem.
There is no figure in the report said Mr Paul Spray head of policy at London based Christian Aid.
The emphasis on improving infrastructural service rather than expanding the stock of infrastructure contained in the world development report echoes a theme which has been repeated in World Bank internal analyses in recent years.
most notably in the Wapenhans report which found an alarming deterioration in the success rate of Bank projects and attributed it in part to an in house culture that rewarded officers more for the volume of new loans arranged than for success with which they followed through on projects.
Although the Bank has taken steps to counter this cultural tendency it has so far failed to convince many of its critics that it has really changed its spots.

World Bank accused of attempting raid on gene reserves Geoff Tansey on a row over control of germplasm a vital resource for the world s plant breeders.
Some 40 major environmental and development NGOs (non governmental organisations) have accused the World Bank of attempting a coup to take over control of the 500 000 crop samples held in gene banks in the various international agricultural research centres such as the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and the Mexico based International Research Centre for Wheat and Maize which developed the green revolution varieties of rice and wheat.
The row over who controls this germplasm a vital resource for future plant breeding and a major asset gathered from the poor farmers and countries of the world looks set to dominate an international meeting on biological diversity that began in Nairobi yesterday.
The NGOs want the second session of the Intergovernmental Committee of the Convention on Biological Diversity to ensure that control over these germplasm collections stays with an intergovernmental body run on a one nation one vote system and that recognises farmers rights.
Agreement on such a body was expected to be endorsed at a meeting of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in New Delhi at the end of May after post UN Conference on Environment and Development negotiations between the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation s Commission on Plant Genetic Resources and the individual research centres.
However this was rejected at the consultative group meeting at which the bank sought to strengthen its leadership of the international agricultural research system.
The research centres are funded by the consultative group an informal group of donors mainly from the industrialised countries and international agencies which is chaired by the bank and faces the worst funding crisis in its 23 year history.
Funding fell by 7 per cent (Dollars 18m) last year and another 6 per cent fall is projected for this year.
As part of its support to the group the Bank announced in New Delhi that it would forgive existing debts increase its normal grant to Dollars 40m and offer to match new funds from other donors up to a total of Dollars 60m.
5bn fund over five years for lending to national agricultural research linked to the consultative group.
Along with this cash came the creation for the first time in its 23 years of a group steering committee chaired by the bank.
It also announced that it would consult the World Trade Organisation about the intellectual property provisions in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the disposition of the group s germplasm.
The NGOs see this as aimed at preventing intergovernmental control of the germplasm which will become increasingly important once countries begin charging for collecting crops within their borders.
If they set high prices then searching out materials from the existing collections will become more important for users.
At present the legal status of the research centres collections is not clear.
Countries where they are based such as the Philippines which hosts IRRI for example might be tempted to exert national control over the collections if they feel that developing countries will be kept out of policy making over the use of these collections according to Rene Vellve of Grain (Genetic Resources Action International).
In a statement on plant genetic resources to the Nairobi meeting Ismail Serageldin Chairman of the consultative group and a vice president of the World Bank confirms that the research centres should not seek to benefit financially from the commercialisation of germplasm but should help developing countries obtain financial benefit when opportunities occur.

When the Bretton Woods conferees concluded their deliberations of 50 years ago they thought they had created a new international monetary system to replace the monetary anarchy of the 1930s and a new bank that would replace the international capital market which had been killed off by the defaults induced by the Great Depression.
The Bretton Woods monetary system died in the early 1970s.
The international capital market confounded the conferees expectations.
It revived to a point where it at least matches its golden age before the first world war.
The contribution of the World Bank to international lending is now marginal.
The remaining legacy of the Bretton Woods conference is the two large bureaucracies known as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Since the original remit of both institutions has vanished and bureaucracies are inherently unlovable it is not too surprising that there are suggestions to abolish them.
But the 50 years is enough campaign is orchestrated by those who are not necessarily dedicated to the objectives that both organisations are now pursuing.
helping poor countries catch up with rich ones and assisting former centrally planned economies to make the transition to a market economy.
Both have in fact exhibited a substantial measure of flexibility in adapting their operations to evolving circumstances.
The task of development or of making the transition from communism to the market economy would be even harder without the technical expertise and financial support the Bretton Woods institutions provide.
Since the 1970s however both the fund and the bank have been providing increasingly similar support to the same group of countries.
Given the overlap thoughts of merging them inevitably arose.
The only convincing answer to those subversive thoughts would be a return by the IMF to the monetary vocation for which it was created.
Its current role of fostering macroeconomic discipline in non industrial countries would then revert to being a by product of its central task of overseeing the international monetary system rather than the be all and end all of its existence.
There are reasons for believing such a return could improve world economic performance.
The heyday of the Bretton Woods system from the end of the postwar recovery in the late 1950s until the late 1960s was the best decade the world economy has experienced.
It was a golden age in terms of the speed and wide distribution of growth with low inflation and payments imbalances that caused concern but because of that did not build up large debt overhangs threatening prosperity.
This impressive performance was aided by the opportunities of catch up growth in Europe and Japan the scope for exploiting the first easy stage of import substitution in developing countries the inheritance of low inflation and the absence of big economic shocks.
Nevertheless the Bretton Woods system with its dedication to balance of payments discipline and equilibrium exchange rates alongside full employment helped.
While the years since 1971 have not yielded disasters comparable with the 1930s the cup is no more than half full.
A massive overvaluation of sterling in the early 1980s destroyed far too much of British manufacturing.
In the mid 1980s there was an equally large overvaluation of the dollar the reaction to which threatened the international trading system.
Happy go lucky attitudes toward payments imbalances led directly to the international debt crisis which cost much of the developing world a decade of progress.
The attempt to freeze European exchange rates prematurely led to a far deeper recession than would otherwise have occurred.
they were not avoided because there were no rules of the game as appropriate to their era as the Bretton Woods rules were to the 1960s.
Bretton Woods rules cannot be resurrected primarily because capital mobility has made it very difficult to manage exchange rates with narrow bands and occasional jumps in central rates.
But that is no reason for failing to design rules that would be equally appropriate to our age.
Such rules should provide for a system of target zones for exchange rates with central rates set for consistency with satisfactory medium run macroeconomic outcomes and regularly revised to prevent their becoming outdated.
Concerted intervention backed up when necessary by changes in interest rates could prevent rates leaving the zones even under the current situation of high capital mobility provided intervention did not occur until it was virtually certain that the market had overshot.
Ideally there would also be international pressure for responsible fiscal policies meaning far smaller budget deficits over the cycle combined with active anti cyclical stabilisation.
But politicians are searching for institutional mechanisms that will tie their hands with respect to fiscal policy.
In a recent speech at the Institute for International Economics the managing director of the IMF stated that he yearned for more currency stability.
He also declared that in many ways circumstances were now propitious for movement in that direction.
The obstacles he implied lay in the continuing resistance of many of the member countries.
It would have been an ideal 50th birthday present for the IMF if the most powerful and most resistant of those members the Group of Seven leading industrial countries had invited the managing director to their Naples summit this weekend specifically to explore ways of rebuilding an international monetary system worthy of the name in whose management the IMF would once again have a central role.
The memory of Bretton Woods would be even better honoured if the summit asked what else needed to be done to update the international economic system.
So far as the World Bank is concerned there is nothing that could not be remedied by having a president who had spent a lifetime in economic development.
The Bretton Woods twins are about to be joined by their long lost sibling a World Trade Organisation to ensure countries take account of the global interest in liberal trade.
There is also a need to create a Global Environmental Organisation to ensure that similar account is taken of environmental spillovers.

FT 15 JUL 94 Sweeping changes urged on UN.
A privately funded study of the United Nations and its agencies proposes sweeping reforms to meet global problems that can no longer be neglected without catastrophic consequences.
The authors former international civil servants with considerable experience in the workings of the organisation are Sir Brian Urquhart a British war hero who was the UN s first employee in 1945 and Mr Erskine Childers grandson of a former Irish president and an authority on third world development problems.
In their report financed jointly by the Ford Foundation and the Dag Hammerskjold Foundation of Sweden they state that as the UN nears its 50th anniversary next year there is mounting concern about its ability to remain an effective mechanism for peace and security in an increasingly complex world.
The authors recommend radical reforms in the International Monetary Fund created by the Bretton Woods conference held 50 years ago this month.
Third world nations have long criticised the Fund and the World Bank and the report notes that despite or because of these institutions 20 per cent of the global population still holds 80 per cent of world wealth.
Sir Brian and Mr Childers call for a UN monetary financial and trade conference to develop an equitably governed low interest capital lending facility and an equitably governed monetary fund working with a similarly governed universal trade organisation.
They also see a need for a single UN development authority consolidating all present UN development funds and a consolidation of now scattered UN relief operations.
Another proposal is for the establishment of a UN humanitarian security police force.
Critics have accused the world body of allowing politics to influence too many decisions relating to human rights and humanitarian affairs.
The report calls for an inter governmental consultative board for the UN system as a whole an executive committee comprising the secretary general and heads of specialised agencies and a new documentation office responsible for creative management of economic and social reports.
The financially strapped world body could operate more efficiently from a single headquarters the report advises.
This need not be in New York or Geneva although Sir Brian told correspondents at a briefing that he believed keeping New York as the centre would maintain the interest and support of the US.
Germany is prepared to offer inducements to the UN to move many or all operations to Bonn after the German capital transfers to Berlin but so far this has not been seriously considered by member states.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali secretary general had yet to study the report his spokesman said.
The document is not the first such contribution by the authors to debate about the shape and future of the UN.
While their expertise is widely respected far reaching proposals are likely to encounter opposition in a body fundamentally averse to change.

Private view of a public motivator Lewis Preston World Bank president.
Visiting the World Bank at its 19th Street headquarters in Washington DC you would never guess that questions are being raised about its long term future.
You have to negotiate a building site strewn with cranes and earth moving equipment.
With both the bank and the IMF its sister institution across the street racing to complete lavish extensions to their already extensive offices the area resembles a development zone in southern China.
The World Bank has been expanding rapidly for years.
The number of higher level professional staff is now 6 039 (including 1 291 consultants ) an increase of a third in five years and more than 50 per cent in a decade.
Since 1991 when Mr Lewis Preston took over as president the bank s administrative budget has risen 44 per cent to Dollars 1.
staff costs (excluding consultants) have risen 43 per cent to Dollars 876m.
To his credit Mr Preston has no apparent interest in empire building.
He welcomes the Group of Seven s call in Naples for a review of the role of international institutions.
If there is any duplication overlap or waste let s get it out he says.
Questioned about the bank s future he states repeatedly that it must intervene more selectively and become more cost efficient.
It would be absolutely wrong to continue lending to countries that could easily obtain capital from private sources.
We shouldn t interfere where the private sector is prepared to invest he says.
Having spent 40 years at JP Morgan the premier New York bank Mr Preston seems untroubled by the notion of transferring bank functions to the private sector.
Over time the shift that is called for will occur should occur and must occur he says.
He has an admiration for private enterprise that is perhaps not entirely shared by senior colleagues who have never experienced life outside the public sector womb.
Yet although he seems personally convinced that the bank should contract this theme does not come across clearly in the bank s vision statement to be released tomorrow in a 50th anniversary attempt to redefine its goals and defuse growing criticism.
And it is unclear whether he has the stomach for serious downsizing.
At times he gives the impression he is fighting a losing battle against the bank s permanent bureaucrats.
At Morgan he says strategic change was readily accomplished.
He simply discussed a plan with four or five colleagues and then implemented it.
He was able to incentivise people and make things happen.
The situation is entirely different in a large public sector bureaucracy.
People at the bank he says have seen presidents come and go.
Since 1989 private flows to developing countries have quadrupled to about Dollars 120bn dwarfing the bank s total commitments of about Dollars 20bn.
He notes that the bank s loans have fallen off sharply in recent years partly because countries such as India are awash with private inflows and no longer need its adjustment loans.
He hopes there will be a significant number of graduations in Latin America in other words countries that become too rich to qualify for World Bank support.
But the bank has to move carefully he warns because the recent jump in private flows might not be sustainable.
It was spurred by interest rates in developed countries that are at their lowest level since the second world war.
He says there are two reasons why the bank s staff and headquarters expenses have risen so rapidly despite the reduced demand for loans.
The first is the need to meet the historic challenge posed by the transition to capitalism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
He cannot cut back elsewhere because members were very insistent that we didn t dilute services to the existing customer base.
He has also needed to fill gaps in the bank s skills mix.
He has created new vice presidencies covering areas in which the bank expects to play a larger role in the future.
the environment private sector development and human resources such as health care and education.
The bank now employs 200 environmental experts compared with a handful when it embarked on the much criticised Namada dam project in India in the mid 1980s.
Lending for human resource development now accounts for 17 per cent of all loans against 5 per cent in the early 1980s.
While favouring a larger role for the private sector in development he says some ideas for expanding the International Fi nance Corporation the bank s private sector arm are facile.
The bank proper cannot transfer resources directly to the IFC because they have different owners.
In any case the IFC has sufficient capital to expand its investments at 12 per cent a year until 2005.
The biggest change facing the bank is a likely increase in its advisory role in developing countries and a corresponding reduction in its importance as a financier.
With private capital more readily available the challenge is to help clients restructure their public sectors so as to create a climate in which private business can flourish.
If the bank charged fees he muses it would be able to test the strength of demand for its services.
And it could see how it measured up to private sector competitors.
If Lazard and Warburgs can give it cheaper and it s better there will be an even more rapid diminution in staff he says.
But then he frowns remembering that he is at the World Bank not JP Morgan.
But the idea of charging for advice is totally alien around here.
He says his greatest achievement at the bank is changing the emphasis from initiation to implementation.
He is referring to recent attempts to alter bank culture by judging staff not by the volume of loans they initiate but by the performance of the projects they help finance.
The emphasis on loan volume rather than project success is said to reflect the production line mentality of Robert McNamara the influential World Bank president in the 1970s and a former head of the Ford car company.
Mr Preston is also proud of introducing the bank to the mysteries of cost accounting.
Incredible though it may seem he says the bank did not have a means of measuring the costs of different activities.
Looking back he admits he may have adopted too low a profile as bank president.
Although some parts of Asia are developing enormously quickly he is concerned by the desperate plight of sub Saharan Africa.
So I don t think 50 years is enough he says firmly referring to strident demands from leftwing environmentalists for the World Bank s closure.
Uncertain returns from a 50 year investment Why the the IMF and World Bank are coming under greater scrutiny from their backers.
Fifty years ago tomorrow representatives from 44 countries signed an agreement at the Mount Washington hotel in the forests of the White Mountains in Bretton Woods in the US which led to the creation of two of the most powerful institutions on the planet.
They dispense over Dollars 30bn in funds every year to countries in Asia Africa Latin America and the former Soviet bloc the largest source of new money for these countries.
If we are to believe a new coalition of social and environmental groups that sprang up this year called 50 years is enough or critics on the libetarian right such as the Cato institute the institutions are the main source of poverty and environmental degradation in their borrower countries.
Two years ago Willi Wapenhans a former vice president of the World Bank was commissioned to examine its existing portfolio of 1 800 projects.
5 per cent of the bank s loans had failed to meet their own minimum estimation of an economic rate of return.
Bank staff promptly replied that their standards were higher than most.
They could not explain why the failure rate had risen by 150 per cent over the previous decade.
it is attributable to deep rooted problems which must be diagnosed and resolved wrote Wapenhans.
it compared staff appraisal reports which are issued before a loan is made to project completion reports which are written up after the last penny has been paid out as well as looking at reviews conducted by its operations evaluation department.
What they had not looked at was how valid were the figures used in these reports and how timely they are in order to ensure that there is some way of correcting problems before it is too late.
This process has now begun and the first report that has come back is less than encouraging.
The Financial Reporting and Auditing Task Force headed up by George Russell a financial adviser in the World Bank s central and operational accounting division shows that over 60 per cent of the audits of its projects are not received within the grace period of four to nine months after the fiscal year ends making it inconsequential for project management purposes according to the reviewers.
A fifth of those received have a qualified adverse or disclaimed opinion.
the auditors believe that either additional information is required before the audit can be signed the audit is misleading or there is insufficient information for the auditor to judge the audit.
In addition Russell s team report that the format of the (financial) information received often does not allow for (1) comparison with staff appraisal reports (2) linkage of physical achievements with project expenditures and (3) reconciliation with bank disbursement records.
Interviews with members of the team reveal that in many countries particularly in Africa the government auditors have no clue about how to prepare proper financial statements.
Even within the World Bank itself at its headquarters in Washington the importance of proper financial reporting has been downgraded.
The Wapenhans taskforce pointed out that in 1980 the bank had 270 financial specialists of which 29 per cent were considered experienced.
By 1992 it discovered there were 190 specialists 30 per cent less of which a mere 22 per cent were considered experienced.
As for the International Monetary Fund its critics say that while it provides interested parties with statistics galore it leaves out the most crucial information.
Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University who has advised a dozen countries from Bolivia to Russia on their economic policies told a recent Congressional hearing there was no way to judge the performance of the institution because nobody knew any more than its most general recommendations.
I must say that the IMF resisted in a number of cases the very measures which turned out to be enormously successful after the fact and then the IMF is able to say after the fact we supported those policies because there is no documentation to say to the contrary he said.
Between 1980 and 1989 241 structural adjustment programmes were put in place in 36 countries.
As the United Nations Children s Fund (Unicef) points out over the same period three quarters of these countries in Africa Asia and Latin America experienced marked declines in their per capita income.
Using advice from activist groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and International Rivers Network the Senate has drawn up a list of minimum conditions the IMF must meet if it wants more money from the US.
Under these recommendations the IMF must encourage borrowing countries to give them permission to publish the Article IV agreements which are the details of policies that the IMF wants the country to follow the recent economic development papers and the policy framework papers for each country as well as the letters of intent.
To underscore their impatience with the IMF the Senate slashed contributions to the IMF s Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility from a requested Dollars 100m to Dollars 25m next year.
The House of Representatives went further and recommended giving the IMF nothing at all.
Karin Lissakers the US executive director on the IMF s board who as the US representative controls 18.
3 per cent of the votes in the institution says she hopes to get the rest of the board to agree to make these changes.
Last week the IMF said that it was trying to put some of the policies into effect by its annual meeting in Madrid in September.
The bank was persuaded by similar pressure from activists last year through the US Congress to give out more information through a new public information centre and to set up an independent inspection panel to review complaints.
The panel will come into existence next month but the information policy has been in place for six months.
US Congressman Barney Frank called a hearing last month to review progress.
Testifying before Frank was Lori Udall of IRN.
Since 1989 the bank has had an information policy that states the general presumption in favour of disclosure of information in the absence of a compelling reason not to disclose.
Despite this presumption in practice the bank has consistently restricted almost every type of information regarding bank projects.
First they have sovereign guarantees that ensure that the World Bank and the IMF have to be paid back and that their debt cannot be rescheduled.
Second without their stamp of approval no country can receive international credit.
Thus the World Bank and IMF cannot fail no matter what recommendations they make to countries.
Things might be very different if these guarantees were withdrawn and they were forced to compete with the private sector they are so eager to espouse.
At the very least governments should be entitled to know whether they are getting their money s worth.

FT 27 JUL 94 World Bank laments its Tanzania role.
Hans Georgeson and Michael Holman on an internal study that admits to uncritical support for Nyerere.
World Bank loans exceeding Dollars 1bn to Tanzania over nearly three decades following its independence helped sustain a poorly thought out socialist experiment according to a confidential internal report drawn up by the agency.
The two volume analysis of relations between the World Bank and Tanzania between 1961 and 1987 is highly critical of the support for former President Julius Nyerere s socialist programme launched in 1967.
The report obtained by the Financial Times is still confidential according to World Bank officials yesterday though they said this may be reviewed in the light of the bank s new disclosure of information policy.
Mr Nyerere nationalised the country s industries and some 14m peasants and their families were compulsorily re grouped in ujamaa or collective villages in an effort to make water health and education more accessible.
But the badly planned exercise disrupted agricultural production.
Since independence in 1961 the bank and other donors have provided more than Dollars 15bn in aid.
The largest single contributor has been the bank with loans to date totalling Dollars 2.
1bn while Sweden Denmark and Norway have together provided Dollars 3bn.
The hitherto unpublished report although compiled in 1990 five years after Mr Nyerere retired throws new light on the donors share of responsibility for Tanzania s economic decline.
Many of the issues raised including problems of aid co ordination effective utilisation of assistance and donor reluctance to disclose policy failures continue to characterise current efforts to tackle Africa s development crisis.
The document suggests that what it sees as Mr Nyerere s well meaning but impractical socialist vision was indulged by senior bank officials.
Mr Robert McNamara the former US defence secretary was bank president from 1968 to 1981 most of the period covered by the report.
The report criticises what it calls a stance of uncritical support for government policies adding.
Even where risks were noted the board (of directors) consistently reiterated that it was the bank s role to be at the forefront of social innovation and change supporting new approaches to development even at the risk of failure.
The bank s practice of choosing to accept and not to influence the development path led to considerable difficulty when the bank then sought to restablish some influence in the 80s.
The bank accepted Tanzania s road to socialism enunciated in 1967 as a fait accompli adding that since 1967 and at least until 1980 the bank viewed Tanzania as coming close to being a model developing country.
But misgivings of successive missions concerning the effectiveness of the planning mechanism the workability of industrial policies and the viability of an array of industrial projects initiated in the late 1960s and early 1970s did not evoke sober Bank reaction.
Initial gains in literacy primary school enrolment and life expectancy in the post independence era seemed to have validated Mr Nyerere s approach.
aid projects were seldom self sustaining and donors were having to maintain as well as fund projects such as roads.
the state dominated industrial sector was increasingly inefficient.
As the report points out Tanzania s unprecendented access to concessionary flows of external capital has allowed it.
to maintain a high rate of largely ill conceived and uneconomical industrial investment.
The cushioning effect of this access to funds at least until the late 1970s reduced the government s receptivity to external advice for badly needed reforms in the country s economic planning and management system policy framework and institutional arrangements.
It was not until 1981 that the bank acknowledged that the situation was getting out of hand.

No effort was made to dissuade the leadership from embarking on ambitious industrialisation programmes when fundamental preconditions for such an undertaking identified by the bank earlier were lacking.
The bank remained an apathetic observer and an impotent bystander of unfolding developments as Tanzania became the testing ground for an allegedly unique socialist experiment and one that was poorly thought out at that.
None of the donors challenged the conventional wisdom though by the mid 1970s it was apparent Mr Nyerere s vision was turning out to be an egalitarian folly.
The report highlights a problem still common among development agencies government multilateral and voluntary in Africa today.

The bank was not prepared to question openly the underlying conflict between the ideological intentions and what was realistically feasible it comments.
No attempt was made to communicate to the political leadership at the highest level privately the true dimensions of the situation at least not until the late 1970s says the report.
By the mid 1980s Tanzania s honeymoon with the donors was ending and overall aid levels have been falling over five years reflecting recession in developed economies aid fatigue and dissatisfaction with Tanzania s performance.
With Tanzanians per capita incomes more than halved since 1980 the government of President Ali Hassan Mwinyi is trying to redress the legacy with mixed results.
Institutionalised corruption permeating the top echelons of government is threatening to undermine fragile macro economic stability.
Western diplomats estimate up to 10 per cent of aid disappears in this way.
Many donors are still cautious in their comments but a Scandinavian official acknowledges its aid programme supported Tanzania through a period when in retrospect we probably shouldn t have.

Thirty years after independence and some Dollars 16bn worth of aid later a country which once aspired to self reliance has become aid dependent with nearly 50 per cent of its recurrent and development budget funded by donors.
The largest single contributor has been the Bank while Scandinavian countries have been amongst the largest bilateral donors.
Although compiled in 1990 five years after Mr Nyerere retired the unpublished report raises far reaching questions about the donors share of responsibility for Tanzania s economic decline as well as questions about current efforts to tackle Africa s wider ranging development crisis.
Mr Nyerere nationalised the country s industries and some 14m peasants and their families were compulsorily regrouped in ujaama villages in an effort to make water health and education more accessible.
But the badly planned exercise conducted by an authoritarian bureacracy severely disrupted agricultural production and contributed to soil erosion and deforestation.
By 1985 the country s deepening economic crisis forced the government to adopt market driven reforms.

Roles that World Bank and IMF must give up.
Sir Coinciding with the recent 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods conference some 70 citizens organisations in the US launched the 50 years is enough campaign to hold the World Bank and International Monetary Fund accountable to people whose lives they affect across the developing world.
The campaign is working with similar coalitions around the globe.
Unfortunately both John Williamson ( Rules needed for a new age July 8) and Michael Prowse ( Private view of a public motivator July 18) have mischaracterised the US campaign and misrepresented its positions.
We do strongly recommend cutting its resources and responsibilities so as to reduce its power and the damage it causes.
The campaign also agrees with many analysts that the IMF should get out of determining development policy.
Furthermore Williamson suggests that the members of our campaign are not dedicated to helping poor countries catch up with rich ones and assisting former centrally planned economies to make the transition to a market economy two supposed goals of the Bretton Woods institutions.
It is World Bank and IMF adjustment programmes that have led to increased poverty widened the gap between the rich and the poor gutted local productive capacity and accelerated environmental degradation in most of the some 75 countries in which they have been imposed.
We believe that economic policy reforms must support the productive activities of the poor (particularly women) stimulate greater local self reliance increase workers rights and wages and enhance broad based sustainable food production.
Our platform which apparently neither Williamson nor Prowse has read also calls for a shift away from large scale infrastructure projects that displace millions of people in favour of smaller resource conserving investments.
But more importantly the road of change must be paved by the people themselves who should be left to determine the direction and pace of their own economic future.
Doug Hellinger The Development GAP executive committee member US 50 Years is Enough Campaign 1025 Vermont Avenue NW 3rd Floor Washington DC 20005 US.
In the financial year ending June 1994 the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development the commercial lending arm of the World Bank Group made net disbursements to developing countries of minus USDollars 731m.
So too will the fact that administrative expenses have risen 60 per cent over the past six years while gross disbursements have stagnated.
Inevitably the Bank is finding it difficult to convince the public that it knows what it is doing and is doing it efficiently and effectively.
What makes the task particularly difficult is the changed international climate.
Historically the Bank had two groups of supporters in industrial countries.
The first group has now disappeared while those who claim to have the interests of developing countries at heart now condemn the Bank for its stinginess its heavy handedness its encouragement of environmental despoliation and its neglect of the cause of the poor.
For all its might the Bank lacks friends and lacking friends is politically vulnerable.
It is a large international public organisation that must work with and through governments.
Its brief is in essence to assist developing countries achieve rapid poverty alleviating growth.
East Asian developing countries have shown the way.
The trick difficult in most places and hitherto impossible in some notably in Africa is to help others follow the same path.
Economic returns The Bank must confront its critics.
If it is to be blamed for its failures it must point to such successes as East Asian development and the green revolution.
It must also reject the notion that its brief is to transfer resources something that could be done better by a check writing machine.
The wasteful use of oil revenues by so many oil exporting developing countries demonstrates that the mere availability of money does not ensure economic development.
The question instead is whether lending brings satisfactory economic returns to borrowers.
True the Bank has made big mistakes.
over rural development lending for example the sustainability of the commercial bank lending of the 1970s and the durability of the energy crisis.
It is as important for the Bank to admit and learn from such mistakes as it is to stand up for itself.
Less bureaucratic Yet if the Bank is to defend both itself and its core mission it must also change.
First it must become leaner and much less bureaucratic.
The recent proposal by Mr Lewis Preston the Bank s president to reduce the administrative budget by 6 per cent a year in real terms will increase the pressure.
Third it must be more aggressive with its critics more aggressive with its clients and also more aggressive when appropriate on behalf of its clients.
If for example it believes there ought to be more generous official debt relief for Africa it should say so loudly and clearly.
There is much debate inside and outside the Bank about what sort of future it might have.
Some believe the prospect is one of genteel decline as its activities are progressively limited to Africa and South Asia.
Others believe it could become an integrator of ideas and money world wide even in countries that do not need its direct financial assistance.
The challenges of eliminating extreme poverty and helping to integrate most of humanity within the global market economy remain huge.
Notwithstanding its faults the Bank represents a unique and irreplaceable repository of experience skill and financial resources dedicated to these tasks.
Their appropriate use must also be vigorously defended.
Taming the beast of H Street Costs are being cut at a World Bank critics claim is bloated and bureaucratic.
Last week Lewis Preston president of the World Bank Group since 1991 dropped a little bombshell into the laps of his staff.
Over the next three years he proposed the budget should be cut at an annual rate of some 6 per cent in real terms.
Stringency has come to what its critics argue is a bloated and over bureaucratic leviathan.
First class air travel has already gone.
Preston s stringency is the latest element in a programme of internal management reform progressively introduced since his arrival three years ago.
It goes well for example with dollar (or cash) budgeting under which senior managers are being given sums with which to achieve agreed objectives.
The financial squeeze partly reflects Preston s appreciation of the chilly climate.
Some shareholders notably the US believe the Bank should share the pain felt by public sectors everywhere.
They note that between the financial years 1990 (July 1989 to June 1990) and 1995 staff costs of the Bank Group are expected to rise by 56 per cent to Dollars 878.
8m (Pounds 556m) and overall costs to grow by 60 per cent to Dollars 1 420.
Total administrative costs this year are larger than the gross domestic products of several of the Bank Group s clients Mozambique being an example.
So large an increase in expenses seems surprising since lending activities have stagnated for many years (see chart).
Shahid Husain the Bank s recently appointed vice president for management and personnel services explains the rising costs by reference to three developments.
hugely expanded work on eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union little of which has as yet borne fruit in lending.
expanded lending for the environment which is relatively labour intensive.
and improved project implementation following the Wapenhans report on that topic.
These explanations provide a valuable reminder that the Bank s mission is not to transfer money at minimum cost.
But the president obviously feels that things have gone too far all the same.
The question is how the proposed squeeze on costs fits into his attempt to remedy the failures of what he once judged among the most under managed institutions he had encountered.
The equity (paid in capital plus reserves) of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development the Bank s commercial lending arm is Dollars 26.
If the Bank were merely to earn a 5 per cent real return on its capital it would be able to support the current level of administrative costs in perpetuity.
This huge subsidy must however be justified by performance.
There has been a broad recognition led by Preston that an institution like the Bank cannot keep on expanding says Husain.
You don t simply manage loans and you don t simply manage economic and sector work but you have to manage resources and people.
Improvement in efficiency and reduction of costs have to become an integral part of the work of the Bank.
The task is made urgent by the criticism of the institution and by the rapidity with which the world continues to change.
The Bank s main long term mission is deemed to be the alleviation of poverty above all in Africa and South Asia along with environmentally sustainable development.
But around this core the Bank must be tremendously mobile in Husain s words.
Before Preston s arrival the Bank had suffered two traumatic re organisations.
These focused on the Bank s structure rather than on its processes and procedures.
We believe that large traumatic changes of the sort that took place in 1987 leave behind so much debris that in the long run they are self defeating.
One disadvantage of such infrequent large changes is that people do not take change as a normal way of life.
What we are trying to inculcate however is the idea that since the world around us is changing all the time so must we.
The other disadvantage alluded to by Husain is the effect on staff morale.
The World Bank employs highly qualified staff who believe in what the Bank does but dislike the institution itself.
This problem of poor morale was greatly exacerbated by the 1987 upheaval in which staff were simply told to scramble for new jobs as in a giant game of musical chairs.
When Preston came to the Bank he found an organisation still shattered by that event.
This had reduced staff numbers by about 500 and created four large self contained regional offices.
The number of regular staff at 6 406 last June can be compared with the 6 095 in June 1986 before reorganisation and the 5 665 shortly afterwards.
The new structure coped quite well with narrowly regional challenges such as structural adjustment in Latin America and the growing involvement with China.
But Husain argues that this decentralised Bank could not serve us well in providing a centrally driven response to changes in the international environment.
For example our work on the environment was slow to take off.
Our work on Russia and eastern Europe also took time to take off.
And above all we took a long time to recognise that the wind had changed and that our constituents both in the developed and developing countries expected much greater rigour in management and efficiency.
Preston s initial effort was to strengthen the centre by creating a presidential office with three managing directors.
He also established three new central units in the areas of sustainable development human resources and promotion of the private sector.
A next stage was to strengthen the Bank s personnel and management function.
Husain says that in the course of the 1987 reorganisation there was an almost total demolition of the central management and personnel capacity.
There was no unit that was concerned with business processes.
(there was) very poor capacity on organisation issues poor capacity for recruitment for an institution which basically has only one asset its people and inadequate management of training and skills.
The main emphasis has been on changing processes but changes in processes are expected to affect structure as well.
This sequence from process to structure rather than the other way around is novel for the Bank.
It is now looking at specific parts of its organisation one after the other asking first whether what is being done should be done and second whether things should be done in the way they are being done.
So far the spotlight has shone on the East Asian regional office and on the international economics department.
Simultaneously attention is being paid to the administrative apparatus and information management.
Market testing and contracting out are among the buzz words here.
The work has already been completed in one department of the East Asia region.
Attention will soon be turned to South Asia and Latin America.
We hope to complete all this work in the next two years.
Husain gives a telling example of what is involved by pointing to the Bank s core function lending for projects.
In our old procedure project officers would first have preliminary ideas.
They would write up these preliminary ideas which would be reviewed within the division with people in support departments with the director and with the regional vice president.
The second step would be a final project summary which would go through the same review process.
In the meantime much project preparation would take place.
After this last review a mission would be sent to appraise the project.
The mission would come back and would prepare an issues memorandum.
Again people would collect from around the Bank to look at those issues.
Then the vice president would give the go ahead to write the appraisal report.
When the negotiations were completed someone in the vice president s office would look at the final negotiated project which would be sent to the Board for approval.
What we are doing in the case of East Asia is to have one simultaneous review at a very early stage.
Husain admits that this may all seem minor but every year we approve 250 projects.
At any time the World Bank is working on 1 000 projects.
It also spends massive amounts on economic and sector work.
We believe it is through this detailed re engineering that we will get to the issue of cost and efficiency.
It will involve a tremendous amount of effort in selection of people and in training.
It will also require rationalisation of internal information and technology.
The Bank is in short trying to get things right first time.
For what has effectively been a governmental bureaucracy these are huge changes with radical implications for delegation and training and for the quality of the people doing the jobs as opposed to those who manage the people who do the jobs.
These efforts at improved internal management do appear significant.
over the effectiveness of the board for example particularly in supervising the Bank s management.
and over the effects on the shaky morale and hunger for security of a staff whose opportunities elsewhere are limited both by their experience at the Bank and by the G4 visa for foreign members which prevents them from staying in the US.
Senior managers seem convinced that they have to be answered decisively and effectively if the Bank is to enjoy a secure future.
FT 30 SEP 94 Worlds apart on how to change world.
The Bretton Woods institutions and their persistent charity and interest group critics.
They are concerned with the same issues have offices in the same building but they are worlds apart.
The World Bank and to a lesser extent the International Monetary Fund are under intense and persistent attack from a clutch of charities and interest groups at this year s annual meeting of the two bodies in Madrid.
From a small suite of offices in the main meeting hall household names such as Oxfam Greenpeace and Christian Aid are campaigning for the Bank to change its policies.
Smaller little known organisations such as VLK the Slovak Forest Protection Group are also represented and seeking to stop specific programmes.
The 50 years is enough campaign a Washington based lobby group has mounted a slick well oiled crusade to cut the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund down in size.
It wants the International Development Association the World Bank s soft loan agency for helping the poorest developing nations to be removed from the Bank s control.
It also is campaigning for a denial of future capital requests to curb the Bank s ordinary lending operations and the IMF s loans to the poorest countries through the Fund s Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
Read the World Bank s annual report with its account of lending operations to promote development and listen to the criticism from the 30 40 non governmental organisations drawn to this year s annual meeting and it is difficult to believe that they have the same aims of improving the lot of the poor of the planet.
Mr Lewis Preston the World Bank president yesterday declared that the two Bretton Woods institutions had played a major role in co ordinating and financing the development effort over the 50 years in which they have existed.
Oxfam by contrast charged that the current IMF and World Bank policies were actually jeopardising prospects for sustainable recovery and poverty reduction.
Christian Aid has said that the structural adjustment programmes of the IMF and World Bank are damaging the poorest people in debt burdened developing countries.
It called for the phasing out of the IMF s enhanced structural adjustment facility.
Greenpeace weighed in with a report saying that the World Bank was failing to implement programmes to phase out ozone depleting substances in developing countries and so hindering the restoration of the ozone layer.
Yet some non government organisations also co operate with the Fund and the Bank.
The Bank was involved in 114 projects with NGOs in its most recent financial year to the end of June.
According to Mr Preston NGOs have some involvement in 50 per cent of the Bank s lending activities in Africa.
Most NGO involvement is in the design implementation and monitoring of programmes.
But they also helped finance 11 projects last year.
This involvement helps explain why critics of the Bretton Woods institutions divide into a radical wing such as the 50 years is enough campaign.
They want to curtail the activities of the two organisations and more moderate groups which hope to change their practices.
The influence of the NGOs has been increasingly apparent over the past decade with the Bank paying more regard to the environment and putting greater emphasis on combating poverty.
On the evidence of this week s meeting in Madrid their influence looks set to grow as the IMF and the World Bank embark on their second half century.
FT 30 SEP 94 Oxfam urges big change at World Bank.
Big changes in the approach of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank towards Latin America were urged by the British based aid organisation Oxfam in Madrid yesterday.
After four successive years of economic growth Latin America has come to be regarded as a success story for the market oriented policies urged by Washington based organisations.
But in yesterday s report Oxfam said Latin America s free market revolution has only widened already extreme income inequalities and worsened poverty.
Oxfam welcomes the World Bank s recent commitment to poverty reduction but remains concerned that the strategy adopted is essentially a repackaging of the IMF and World Bank s policies with social investment and safety nets added on.
According to the charity the new policies main flaws are that they fail to introduce policies for wealth distribution and do nothing to protect what it calls basic rights a lack of which has resulted in low wage precarious jobs unequal land distribution restricted access to capital and inadequate health and education.
It says IMF stabilisation policies and World Bank insistence on market deregulation import liberalisation and export growth have undermined any anti poverty strategy.
Growth was also based on the dismantling of workers rights and the erosion of wages which would further worsen economic insecurity.
Its central recommendation is for the two institutions to replace their current single policy blueprint with a country by country reform strategy based on dialogue with local civil organisations governments and relevant UN agencies.
It favours selective trade protection and carefully targeted subsidies for key industries as well as low real interest rates.
It also calls for social clauses in international trade and investment agreements to reverse the current trend towards low wage export strategies.
Land reform should be a central element of the World Bank s poverty reduction strategy.
Further it says foreign debt is still draining many Latin American countries of resources.
The Brady plan though welcome had been biased towards big debtors and had failed to restore their long term financial stability.
Meanwhile debt to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank has become an increasing part of the problem rising from 5 per cent of the regional debt stock in 1980 to 28 per cent in 1992.
It urges quick implementation of the British government s proposal to use IMF gold stocks for debt relief for very poor countries and says debt relief should be separated from IMF reform packages.

FT 07 OCT 94 Bretton twins at an awkward age.
The fundamental task of the World Bank and IMF is to do themselves out of a job argues Martin Wolf.
It has not been a particularly happy 50th birthday for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
By that age people have built up along with a record of achievements a list of disappointments and mistakes.
The attitudes and knowledge acquired in their youth have often become outmoded.
So it is for the twins born at the Bretton Woods conference in July 1944.
For all the show at their annual meetings in Madrid this week these are troubled giants.
They have a host of enemies and many friends do not like them much either.
The brilliantly achieved aim of the Bretton Woods conference was to re establish a global market economy.
The assumption particularly on the part of the British delegation headed by the economist Lord Keynes was that there would be no return to a world of free capital flows and hot money.
Thus the articles of the IMF required that currencies be convertible only on current account (to pay for goods and services).
Governments could retain controls on capital movements to enable them to maintain fixed exchange rates while pursuing policies for full employment.
Similarly the World Bank was created to finance post war reconstruction and economic development because the private capital flows that had financed growth in the late 19th century would or it was believed should not return.
In the light of the Great Depression and contemporary advances in economic thought these were reasonable assumptions.
The IMF lost its envisaged function with the collapse of the fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s largely caused by the impossibility of combining pursuit of full employment with fixed exchange rates once capital flows were set free.
Since then the Fund has increasingly become the macro economic policeman of the more fallible developing countries encouraging them to change economic policy when in balance of payments difficulties.
Under three entrepreneurial managing directors it also found a wider role in co ordinating international responses to the oil crises of the 1970s the debt crisis of the 1980s and Soviet communism s collapse.
Similarly the World Bank has been elbowed aside by surging private capital flows after the long hiatus of the debt crisis.
Regional development banks have also taken over some of its work notably in Asia and Latin America.
In 1993 the net external financing of developing countries was Dollars 170bn (see table).
But the net disbursements of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development commercial arm of the World Bank were a mere Dollars 2.
3bn in the financial year ending June 1993 and negative at minus Dollars 0.
Even soft lending from the International Development Association was only Dollars 4.
The bank has become a marginal provider of development finance.
These profound changes in the global environment have hardly gone unnoticed.
Senior managers of the World Bank are engaged in a vigorous debate over whether theirs is a sunrise or a sunset institution.
The IMF too is debating its future if rather more circumspectly.
Yet the explosion of global financial activity albeit the most important is far from the only development with which the two institutions have to grapple.
The institutions now have some 20 new clients engaged in making the transformation from planned economies to the free market.
However they can also no longer count for support on people concerned about geo strategic competition with the former Soviet Union.
The IMF has recently come under formidable pressure to relax conditionality the imposition of economic policies in return for finance for some borrowers notably Russia.
The pressure on the World Bank is rather to adopt quotas for increased lending to social sectors.
Both institutions but particularly the World Bank are also being told to become more cost effective.
A friendly critic would conclude from the chart that development has worked above all in east Asia.
An informed critic would know that these countries have best conformed to the Washington consensus of fiscal conservatism outward orientation and reliance on market forces.
Those on the anti market left argue instead that the twin institutions bear most blame for what has gone wrong in Latin America the Middle East and Africa.
Meanwhile critics on the market liberal right conclude more plausibly that since they have been associated with failures as much as with success the Bretton Woods twins cannot make a decisive difference.
Their prestige depends on the perception that they know what they are doing but they have made big blunders.
They encouraged much of the lending that led to the third world debt crisis.
they failed to foresee the energy price collapse of the mid 1980s.
the World Bank ignored the environment for too long while some of its project lending proved misguided.
and many countries helped by the IMF have returned to its trough again and again.
Leftist hostility to the market economy has become venomously focused on the Bretton Woods institutions.
The left s commitment to more participation also creates a profound suspicion of governmental structures shared by the market oriented right with its demand for reliance on markets.
So now the left is pursuing its 50 years is enough campaign while Lady Thatcher s former economic adviser Sir Alan Walters argues that the ideal solution would be to abolish the Fund and the Bank 1.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University for example argues the IMF s approach to stabilisation in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has been inappropriate because it fails to understand the economic consequences of the state s political bankruptcy.
The central necessity is to define and defend their core tasks in ways that respond to justified demands and resist unjustified ones.
the subsidiary need is to execute those tasks as efficiently as possible.
The institutions basic operational role can best be defined as helping those economies unable at present to prosper in the global market system.
They must complement the global market economy not substitute for it.
the least successful developing countries notably those in sub Saharan Africa.
relatively dynamic countries such as Indonesia that remain poor and need to achieve large institutional changes.
countries engaged in the switch from state planning to the market economy mainly the former Soviet empire and in its own way China.
and countries that fall into the hands of incompetent populist governments or suffer large adverse shocks.
As a country prospers however and improves links to the global economy and as more of its investment is carried out by entities with access to global capital markets the operational role of these institutions should disappear as in western Europe.
Balance of payments problems can then be managed through the international capital markets.
The IMF s focus is on shorter term macro economic problems while the World Bank s is on longer term structural difficulties.
Given the different time horizons and relationships involved the two institutions should not be merged as some suggest.
In addition the IMF has a useful role vis a vis industrial countries and as important is accustomed to imposing relatively tough conditionality.
But critics fail to realise that its clients would have to make still more savage cuts in spending without it.
Being mainly restricted to the worst managed developing countries is a painfully circumscribed role for the IMF.
Many argue instead that it should play a central role in the formal management of exchange rates.
The independent Bretton Woods Commission under the leadership of Paul Volcker former chairman of the Federal Reserve has recommended that the governments of the major industrial countries should give a high priority to international monetary reforms aimed at reducing large exchange rate fluctuations and serious misalignments 2.
If the IMF were to calculate target zones for exchange rates it would gain a more central role in the world monetary system than ever before.
But the IMF s major shareholders are unlikely to agree to this as Mr Lloyd Bentsen US secretary of the Treasury indicated in Monday s FT.
Today the IMF s managing director attends discussions of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries but has no voice in decisions on exchange rates.
For the foreseeable future the IMF s relations with major industrial countries will depend on its surveillance discussions with countries whose effectiveness is questioned even among the staff.
While the Fund might yet be needed to help with public debt crises in industrial countries that would indicate serious policy failures.
For the World Bank as well longer term prospects are not all that bright.
The fear within it is that lending will move from stagnation to outright decline as its clientele is gradually restricted to south Asia and Africa.
Just as the IMF hopes for a role in exchange rate co ordination some in the bank dream of a consultative role in countries that do not need its funds.
But that would be a remarkable departure for an organisation that has depended on mixing subsidised finance with its recommendations.
In the IMF s case questions about the quality of its advice are legitimate.
Arguments for greater transparency and wider use of outside economists are strong.
More important is a sharper focus on the underlying disease which lies almost always in the functioning of the state.
For its part the World Bank has published a list of the six principles it has derived from its experience selectivity partnership client orientation results orientation cost effectiveness and financial integrity3.
It also defines its objectives as the pursuit of economic reforms that promote broad based growth and reduce poverty investment in people protection of the environment stimulation of the private sector and reorientation of governments on the tasks only they can do.
Finally it is undertaking a re engineering of its internal management processes to make itself more efficient more responsive and more flexible.
Yet the goals hardly look selective and the six principles are little short of banal.
As for the managerial changes they will be difficult to achieve however desirable.
The core functions of the Fund and World Bank are not of course their only ones.
Both provide valuable analyses of global economic trends and undertake useful research and analysis.
Both must also retain a flexible capacity to respond to unforeseen events.
Nonetheless the fundamental job of the Bretton Woods twins is to do themselves out of one.
If they do so successfully their operations ought to have largely faded into history by the time their centenary is celebrated in 2044.

Sir The World Bank s Tim Cullen ( Sleepless and irritable in suburbia October 10) mocks the position of those who seek to halt the World Bank s support of socially and environmentally destructive projects in particular large dams.
This group claims Cullen would like the bank to steer clear of any activities that challenge the right of people to live in pristine poverty.
Presumably Cullen counts among the members of this group International Rivers Network author of the recently released Manibeli Declaration.
This calls for a moratorium on World Bank funding of large dams pending a comprehensive review of the costs and benefits of its past dam projects and the more than 2 000 organisations from 44 countries who have endorsed the declaration.
Cullen arrogantly dismisses the misery caused by the Bank s large dam programme saying merely that people may have to be resettled.
In reality about 10m people have been directly displaced by World Bank supported dams over the past 50 years.
More enlightened employees of the Bank admit that dam displacement takes part on a massive scale and tears apart poor but often self sufficient communities robbing them of their land and jobs and increasing rates of malnourishment sickness and death.
At stake is not people s right to live in pristine poverty but their right not to have their cultures self respect and livelihoods destroyed.
Large infrastructure projects says Cullen merely have the potential to cause environmental damage.
in the real world Bank funded dams have destroyed hundreds of rivers wiped out riverine and coastal fisheries and drowned huge areas of fertile farmland and diverse forests.
If the World Bank were as Cullen claims really concerned about the well being of the billions of people without access to electricity or clean water it would not be promoting uneconomic and technically flawed dam projects which have in most cases failed to support rural water supply or electrification programmes.
The World Bank s own self critical reports which Cullen boasts of (and which the Bank invariably ignores) show that its large irrigation projects have been stunningly inefficient and have had serious environmental side effects.
A 1991 World Bank study revealed that in almost half of the irrigation projects surveyed crop production had actually fallen after project construction.
