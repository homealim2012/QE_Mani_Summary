19920117000000000	FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology: Operation Amazon - Christina Lamb describes plans to put satellite images of the Brazilian rainforest on computer. Name the remotest part of the Amazon rainforest to Diogenes Sales Alves and with the flick of a few switches on his computer he can tell you how much if any deforestation the area has suffered, when and how it happened, whether it contains any Indian settlements, any mining or agricultural activity. Alves is head of a research project at the Brazilian Aerospace Institute (INPE) to compile from satellite images the first comprehensive analysis of the world's largest rainforest. The project, detailing everything down to the last nut gatherer, is expected to be completed by April. It is planned to be one of the highlights of the UN Environment Conference, or Earth Summit as it is known, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro in June. Not only will the study enable examination of geological, hydrological and botanical features (and changes caused by human activity) in the 5.2m sq km of jungle, including areas which have never been penetrated, it will also provide valuable information for some of today's most controversial environmental debates such as whether forest burning is more detrimental to climate change than automobile emissions. In recognition of its work in using satellites to analyse the effect of human development of the Amazon, INPE has been chosen to co-ordinate a study of the world's forests for the Space Agencies Forum. The results will be presented at the Earth Summit. Surprisingly, INPE has only been studying the Amazon for three years. 'In 1988 when global warming became a general preoccupation the world started wanting accurate information about the rate of Amazonian deforestation, so we were asked by the Brazilian government to do a study,' explains Paulo Serra, head of terrestrial observations. Beginning in April 1989 INPE devised a method using computer algorithms to calculate yearly deforestation from remote sensing satellite images taken by the American Landsat 5. Since 1984 the satellite has passed over the same point every 16 days from a 710km high orbit. This means that it always photographs Brazilian territory in the morning when cloud cover is still extensive so it is not ideal. The satellite images are received in Cuiaba in the west of Brazil and transmitted 1,400km to an INPE station at Cachoeira where they are processed to generate photos. Landsat captures light reflected from the earth's surface, producing an image on a scale of 1:250,000 in varying tones of grey. The photographs are given artificial colours - green for forest, darkening according to the density, pink for barren areas, grey for smoke from burnings and blue for rivers and dams. The best 229 photos in terms of clarity of those produced each year are selected, each covering 185 sq km. Examination of these photographs was used in 1989, 1990 and 1991 to calculate the yearly rate of deforestation. But, says Serra: 'We realised this was an enormous amount of work just to get one number - so we decided to analyse the photos so that we can say when, where and how an area was deforested.' To do this INPE has developed its own geographic information system. According to Serra: 'It is not very complicated - really just a matter of common language on what is deforestation - there is a lot of area in the Amazon which is neither rainforest nor deforestation.' Now when the satellite photographs are taken to INPE headquarters at Sao Jose dos Campos to be interpreted, the images are colour coded to represent deforestation of different years. The resulting maps are fed into the computer and can then be used not only to evaluate more accurately the rate of deforestation but also to study its effect on carbon- and hydro-cycles. Some 334 maps will be created to cover the whole area. 'Rather than simply having photos in archives, we can call up any area on computer from which we can make 1,000 observations,' Serra explains. 'I can pick a piece of land near Manaus and say that it suffered X amount of deforestation in 1988 because of this, nothing in 1989 and Y amount in 1990 because of something else. I can see what was deforested for agriculture, for hydroelectric dams, for garimpagem (informal mining) or simply disappeared, each of which has a different impact on the greenhouse effect.' Other uses for the computerised maps include looking at areas inhabited by Yanomami Indians and other indigenous tribes to see where their settlements are and to follow their movements and discover where there have been encroachments by garimpeiros or even cocaine smugglers building illegal airstrips. The maps will be used for the zoning of the 9.4m hectares recently declared a reserve for the Yanomamis. Serra says the maps will also enable the study of the dynamics of forest nutrients, in terms of soil, gases and the waterboard. It will look at how deforestation has affected drainage and where streams have dried up because of silt produced by mining or reduction of forest protection. They should also end ambiguities in, for example, how much of the forest has been destroyed and the efficacy of Brazilian government attempts to outlaw burnings. The government environment agency claims that burnings were down last year on the 14,000 sq km deforested in 1989-90, but ecologists say they are back at 1988-89 levels of 23,800 sq km. The INPE team does not underestimate the importance of the project. 'Not only are we creating the first ever Amazonian database which can be used by the whole world but we may also resolve some long- running debates in Brazil's favour,' Serra claims. With a sly smile, he adds: 'Imagine the enormous effect if we could show through this that Amazon burning has much less impact on the carbon cycle and thus climate change than burning fossil fuels or running cars?'
19920108000000000	FT  08 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Chopping down rainforest myths  -Christina Lamb describes how a Brazilian pulp producer has achieved sustainable growth. To be a virgin wood pulp producer in a world turning increasingly to recycled paper is unfortunate. Worse still is to be based in Brazil - which means being immediately identified with Amazonian rainforest destruction. For such a company in this shrinking market to have doubled its capacity and become the world's largest producer of eucalyptus pulp seems sheer madness. Erling Lorentzen, chairman of Aracruz Celulose, admits that his timing could have been better. While his company has just completed a Dollars 1.2bn project to increase capacity to more than 1m tonnes per year, the pulp industry has, he says, seen a tremendous change of consumer attitudes. Yet Aracruz has become a showcase for how a thorny environmental area can be turned into an economically feasible and environmentally sustainable development project which Lorentzen claims even the greenest of greens cannot reprove. Lorentzen, a Norwegian who came to Brazil in 1953, sees it as his challenge to convert a suspicious world to the use of paper produced from sustainable forestry. Not only has his company invested heavily in forestry, always met 100 per cent of its pulp needs from plantations and planted 1.5m native trees to preserve biodiversity, but he has hired an environmental director and a British PR company to plead his case. He is also lobbying hard for next year's World Environment Conference in Rio to use paper from his pulp. 'Paper produced from sustainable forestry may not have the same ring about it as recycled paper,' admits Gordon Knight, PR adviser for Aracruz, 'but it is better than recycled paper because with recycling one does not know where the original came from. We need to break this myth that saving paper saves rainforests.' Aracruz is well qualified to do this. Its pioneering forestry work has won international recognition such as the prestigious Marcus Wallenberg Prize in 1984 and it will feature as a case study of responsible environmental management in a book being compiled by the Business Council for Sustainable Development to coincide with the Earth Summit. So developed now is its technology that the Aracruz forestry team, led by Yara Ikemori, is exporting seeds back to Australia from where the company initially bought them. Its techniques are also used in South Africa, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. Aracruz has developed the perfect eucalyptus tree - one which grows quickly with a minimum of side branches in order to reduce the amount of land needed for plantation. Carlos Roxo, the environmental director, explains: 'Through genetic engineering we've adapted the tree to the local environment and tried to get the best tree for the area in terms of disease resistance and fibre quality.' The tree improvement programme began in 1973 when Aracruz bought seeds from places with similar conditions such as Indonesia and Australia. As Brazil could not obtain foreign technology the company sent scientists such as Ikemori abroad to places like the Oxford Forestry Institute. According to Ikemori: 'By 1980 we could select the best trees and propagate them.' Having found the best tree Roxo says the turning point was 'realising we could produce trees much faster and better through a cloning process than with seeds'. The simple method is based on planting eucalyptus from propagated rooted cuttings. When trees are felled the stumps have an average of 30 sprouts, each of which is cut into three parts and planted. After 75 days a seedling develops and is planted. Not only is this quicker than using seeds but the cuttings grow with exactly the same characteristics as the mother tree, whereas seeds display variation. Brazil's climatic conditions mean planting can occur the whole year round. Aracruz plants an average of 100,000 seedlings and rooted cuttings per day. So far the company has planted 133,000 of its 200,000 hectares. Aracruz trees take only seven years to reach a mature height of 35 metres compared with 12 years in Spain and Portugal and 35 years for pine trees in northern Europe. According to Roxo, Aracruz's average yield is 35 cubic metres compared with a Brazilian average of 18 and a European of three. 'This means we need 10 times less area than in Europe,' he says. Ecologists complain that eucalyptus plantations damage the soil, encroach into native forest and reduce biodiversity, but the Aracruz team rebuts these charges. The soil is monitored continually and nutrients added; careful land planning means the plantations have never encroached. For variation Aracruz now has more than 100 clonal banks - each developed for a particular soil and considered a new species. Lineu Siqueira, environmental resources manager, heads a programme to preserve the remaining original forest in which he has so far identified 156 bird, 36 mammal and 3,000 insect species. The area around the Aracruz mills on the palm-fringed coastline of Espirito Santo state resembles a chequer-board with row after row of eucalyptus trees like upturned broomsticks standing to attention, interspersed with darker green patches of remaining native forest - one hectare for every 2.4 of eucalyptus. The landscape is different from when Aracruz bought the land and started plantations in 1967. The coastal Atlantic forest had been almost entirely stripped by farmers, cattle raisers, loggers and charcoal burners, leaving land suitable only for coffee plantations. 'Eucalyptus should really be treated like sugar cane as a crop - one which produces huge volumes of wood in a very short time,' explains Roxo. 'We do not cut the Amazon and replace it with eucalyptus - we plant on land a few thousand kilometres away which has already lost biodiversity and doesn't generate anything. By giving this land an economic function we are preventing further incursion into the Amazon.' As part of this aim seedlings and credit are distributed to local farmers to plant eucalyptus on degraded land. This prevents them from cutting down trees to sell for fuel. 'People cannot say that others have no right to cut down trees even if that's the only way they can earn a living,' believes Lorentzen. 'The way to both help them and relieve pressure on forests is through development and you cannot give people anything better than a job'. Lorentzen, who was one of the first signatories of the Business Charter for Sustainable Development, is the leading Brazilian crusader for industry to adopt environmental protection measures. Aside from its forestry programme the company has spent nearly Dollars 300m on environmental measures including a Dollars 100m project to introduce a chlorine-free bleaching process. Aracruz generates almost all its own power. Effluents go through primary treatment, then enter a series of six lagoons before being discharged into the sea 1.7km away from the coast. Lorentzen maintains that environmental protection measures may be costly but necessary. In his case they also make good business sense: 'We export 80 per cent of our production so we have to ensure that our product is environmentally acceptable to our clients and their customers in Europe and the US.' Aracruz issues clients with a policy resolve which they can show to customers who may be tending towards recycled paper. 'It's not only our philosophy it's our self defence,' he says.
19920107000000000	FT  07 JAN 92 / Brazil calls for rethink on use of resources. MR Jose Lutzenberger, Brazil's environment minister, yesterday accused the industrialised world of 'continuing on a suicidal path' and called on world leaders and businessmen to 'use 1992 to rethink our model of economic development'. He warned: 'If we do not want our children to be damned we must end our current destructive culture and stop acting as if the planet is a mountain of resources that we can use up as quickly as possible.' The market economy was only a good model 'if it is complete  - which means including future generations and the have-nots. What we are currently doing with resources such as the Amazon is like the auction of a priceless painting to a group of people who don't know its real worth, by a thief who just wants to take his profit and run.' His appeal came at the launch of the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development, a Dollars 2.4m initiative by 24 of the country's leading companies to create a technological databank. He said the destruction of the Amazon rainforest should be the world's principal preoccupation. Contrary to predictions by leading Amazonian scientists, he claimed that deforestation last year was down on 1990. Although official figures will not be published until April, Mr Lutzenberger said he expected the destruction to be 8,000-9,000 sq km, compared with 14,000 in 1990 and 90,000 in 1987. According to Mr Lutzenberger, the removal of subsidies has virtually eliminated the destruction of rainforest by large ranches. His main preoccupation now was with those exporting precious woods, such as mahogany. A weekend of torrential rain in Rio de Janeiro has left a trail of destruction, with at least 23 people dead and hundreds homeless. The rains, which began late on Saturday, were the worst since 1988, when many people died in flooding or were buried under rubble from favelas (slums) sliding down the hills of the city. The rains swept rubbish and sewage into houses and streets in northern suburbs, leading to renewed fears over cholera.
19920604000000000	FT  04 JUN 92 / Brazil transforms itself from villain into hero. THE surprising star of Earth Summit proceedings so far is Brazil, which has transformed itself from the villain of the environmental world to playing one of most constructive roles in negotiations to forge a North-South consensus. Mr Celso Lafer, Brazil's foreign minister, says 'we consider that as host country our efforts should be to transcend specific positions and try to work out ways countries can find common ground on issues. We're capable of doing this because our own experience makes us aware of conflicts between North and south as we have both problems of poverty and industrialisation within Brazil.' Not only has the conference organisation been impressive for a country in economic crisis, but Brazilian diplomacy was instrumental in achieving agreement on a convention on climate change and its negotiators are currently working hard to obtain a consensus on the biodiversity treaty. It is hard to recognise the country that only three years ago remained defiant and defensive in the face of worldwide censure for its blatant encouragement (and financial incentives) for the burning down of its forests in the name of development. Part of Brazil's new role as defender of the environment emanates from its desire as host country to be seen as successful and its hope of being rewarded with the seat of one of the new commissions which may be created as a result of the summit. As the fifth largest country in the world it is also eager to make its presence more felt on the world stage. This has involved Brazil making compromises over the conference treaties which officials admit would not otherwise have been considered. Its past sensitivity on environmental issues, particularly as the home of the world's largest rainforest and biggest trove of biodiversity, could have easily led it instead to play a position as hardline as that taken by Malaysia, which trumpets its unfettered right to dipose of its resources as it sees fit. Despite Brazil's considerable poverty (40m people live below the poverty line) President Fernando Collor has made environment a priority issue since taking office two years ago and fully endorses the concept of sustainable development. In his opening speech yesterday he said: 'I belong to the generation that launched the first cry of warning against a mode of growth that was leading blindly to the extinction of life on Earth.' It is not just rhetoric. Partly by abolishing subsidies Brazil has reduced annual deforestation by half since 1989, causing a 1 per cent reduction in global emissions. Mr Jose Goldemberg, the environment minister, boasts: 'This is the only effective action taken anywhere in world to cut down emissions'. Mr Collor is talking of environmental and economic zoning of the Amazon to protect threatened species, and has demarcated large areas as Indian reservations, including one the size of Portugal for the 9,000 remaining Yanomamis. It is still easy to criticise Brazil for widescale logging and informal goldmining occurring in the Amazon, but its efforts to make the summit a success should certainly help it restore some green credentials.
19920602000000000	FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (17): Scientist with impeccable green credentials / Profile of Brazil's Environment Minister. A NUCLEAR physicist may seem an unlikely choice for Environment Minister, but Mr Jose Goldemberg's green credentials are impeccable. One of Brazil's best-known scientists, Mr Goldemberg hit the headlines in the late 1970s when he came into direct confrontation with government by opposing the purchase of nuclear reactors under a programme set up with West Germany in 1975. Today, charged with conserving the world's largest rainforest, reducing forest fires, and protecting its 270,000 strong indigenous population from invasion by wildcat goldminers and loggers, 64-year-old Mr Goldemberg is one of the longest surviving members of President Collor's government. Initially appointed as Secretary for Science and Technology he has become Mr Collor's 'fix-it man,' moving over to head the education ministry at the beginning of this year after a corruption scandal caused the downfall of his predecessor, and adding the environment portfolio in April when its incumbent Jose Lutzenberger, Brazil's leading ecologist, was dismissed. Mr Goldemberg is already proving his reputation as a practical no-nonsense man by freeing long delayed money for environmental projects from the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. He makes no effort to disguise his contempt for what he calls the 'hypocrisy of the developed world,' particularly when it comes to the Amazon rainforest, 60 per cent of which is in Brazilian territory. 'We get a lot of advice and very little money - it annoys me tremendously,' he complains. As an example he cites debt-for-nature swaps: 'I had a terrible time inside the government persuading the economy ministry and president to approve the idea. 'Finally, they agreed to allow up to Dollars 100m, yet to date we've received offers for only Dollars 6m.' The first Dollars 2m swap was signed in May this year. Mr Goldemberg's main hope from the Earth Summit is a convention limiting emissions: 'I see it as a bargain. Developing countries such as Brazil have been making strong efforts to cut deforestation and it has been falling ten per cent a year since 1985. 'We cannot cut emissions because this clashes head on with our need for development but if we make an effort to decrease the growth of our emissions the first world should set some targets for reduction of theirs.' One of Mr. Goldemberg's responsibilities is to harmonise the Brazilian position for the Rio conference. His predecessor had considerable difficulties with the Brazilian Foreign Office over its advocacy of the concept of sustainable development - the rational economic utilisation of natural resources such as the forest. Mr Goldemberg believes that outsiders have concentrated too much on stopping deforestation of the Amazon and too little on sustainable development to provide a living for its 16m inhabitants. He warns: 'There's a lot of poetry about sustainable development, but it's a very tricky thing because it produces a low income.' Mr Goldemberg is expected to be only a stop-gap minister until after the Summit and he has no masterplan for the future development of the Amazon. The Brazilian government is not a Soviet-type government which plans in detail, he says - 'it's main responsibility is to keep the minimum of law and order in the Amazon; and the police have enough trouble keeping transgressors in line.'
19920530000000000	FT  30 MAY 92 / Fragile frontline of the forest: People in the Amazon need sustainable development. The Amazon rainforest has had a powerful allure ever since reports of its existence reached Europe in 1500. Numerous adventurers have risked their lives to penetrate its depths in search of riches such as El Dorado - the kingdom of a man so rich that he anointed himself daily in gold dust - or, in the past decade, Serra Pelada, the world's largest open goldmine. A few years ago, it became clear that a less tangible, but more essential, treasure was at risk. Foreign attention was seized by television pictures of burnings in the Brazilian Amazon, wiping out the luxuriant forest to create pasture. The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, 60 per cent of which is in Brazil, was described as 'the lungs of the world' by experts, who warned that the burnings were reducing the planet's oxygen and contributing to global warming. Species were being wiped out before they had been discovered, any of which might contain substances or genetic material that could be used for important cures. Contact from the white man was eliminating Indian tribes, who had no resistance to his diseases, while cattle-ranchers were pushing out the traditional forest people in the cause of producing hamburgers for the First World. The outcry was immediate. Quick calculations showed that, in less than 30 years, an area of forest 10 times the size of Switzerland had been lost. Under international pressure, the Brazilian government ended the financial incentives it was offering for forest clearance, and halved burnings to 11,000 sq km last year compared with an average 22,000 sq km a year in 1978-88. But Mr Jose Goldemberg, the environment minister, admits: 'That was the easy part.' Little has been done for the 16m people for whom the forest is both home and workplace, or about the poverty in which a total 40m Brazilians live, which drives some of them to seek wealth - or merely survival - in the jungle. Mr Alfredo Homma, from the Agricultural Research Institute in the Amazonian port of Belem, complains: 'There has been too much focus on preserving the forest and not enough on providing alternatives for people living within it.' This issue is at the heart of the debate at next week's Earth Summit. Industrial nations see tropical rainforests as a kind of global asset. The Brazilian Amazon makes up 48 per cent of the world's remaining tropical forest; has the greatest biodiversity, with between 15 and 20 per cent of the world's species; has a fifth of the planet's fresh water; and provides a third of its oxygen. To most Brazilians the Amazon is full of resources to be exploited. Its mineral reserves include gold, copper, bauxite, nickel, manganese and the world's largest iron ore mine with reserves of 18bn tonnes; and its hydroelectric potential is a total 100,000MW. Yet the 5m sq km region provides only 6 per cent of gross domestic product, and average income for the region is just Dollars 1,270 a year. General Leonides Goncalves, a former commander of the Amazon region, argues: 'Not to exploit and populate this area is a luxury Brazil cannot afford. What is more important, man or a tree?' Brazil insists that if the north wants it to keep the forest intact and gain access to the genetic material, it should contribute both funds and technology transfers. Mr Jorge Ito, a farmer in the remote Amazonian town of Tome Acu, says: 'If you pay me, I'll happily keep the forest standing. Otherwise I'll cut it down to make a living.' This difference appears so hard to bridge that there will be no legally binding forest convention signed at the Earth Summit, simply a declaration of principles. The difficulty lies in finding a way for people to earn a living from the forest without destroying it - sustainable development or 'living off its interest rather than its assets', as Mr Joseph Connor, president of the International Chamber of Commerce, describes it. The current main activities such as ranching, logging and goldmining are not sustainable in their present form; but they show no signs of abating. The most destructive, ranching, is not as unprofitable as ecologists claimed  -and land remains a safe investment with inflation topping 20 per cent a month. The network of roads built by the army in the 1960s and 1970s and the increasing value of tropical wood have led to an explosion in logging. Mr Chris Uhl, a biologist from Pennsylvania University, says: 'Logging is likely to be the key economic activity in the Amazon for much of the next century.' He argues that, if done selectively, it can be sustainable. But currently there are neither the management skills nor the incentive to be selective; Mr Uhl identifies 40 species of tree at risk. The most frequently cited form of sustainable development for the Amazon is 'extractive reserves', where traditional populations can carry out activities such as rubber-tapping and fruit and nut-gathering. Ms Diana Propper from Cultural Survival International of the US, which sponsors a reserve, explains: 'We want to give people an alternative to destruction by providing them with greater income from the products they traditionally harvest, by helping with processing facilities and creating markets overseas.' She says people are prepared to pay more for such products, but admits that, if a market is created, there is a risk that other people would produce them on large-scale plantations outside the Amazon (as happened with rubber). Mr Homma of the Agricultural Research Institute says: 'At best reserves are a short-term way to gain time while other alternatives emerge.' Ms Propper agrees but adds: 'The people living in the forest are our frontline of defence against destruction and that's what we must concentrate on.'
19920529000000000	FT  29 MAY 92 / Brazil attacks lack of backing for Amazon: FT writers on prepartions for the Earth Summit next week in Rio De Janeiro. A PROJECT to protect the Brazilian Amazon, that was originally planned as the centrepiece of the Earth Summit, may prove an embarrassment. Brazil claims that the industrialised world is failing to take the project seriously, and that too little money is being committed. The Dollars 1.5bn Rainforest Pilot Project was approved by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in 1990 and declared by the World Bank to be an 'example of co-operation between developed and developing countries on global environmental issues.' Yet, two years on, only Dollars 53.5m has been raised, and this only after Brazilian President Fernando Collor had written an angry letter to G7 heads of government. The US, which has been one of the leading critics of Amazonian deforestation, gave only Dollars 5m. 'The first world is being very hypocritical - it annnoys me tremendously,' complains Mr Jose Goldemberg, Brazil's Environment Minister. 'We get a lot of advice and rhetoric but very little money'. He also complains that multilateral institutions are forcing Brazil to support projects in the Amazon of which he is 'very sceptical,' such as extractive reserves - areas reserved for such activities as the gathering of Brazil nuts and rubber-tapping which do not harm the forest but which many analysts believe are condemning people to poverty. 'The maintenance of extractive reserves is very artificial in economic terms  -we're having to make an enormous effort to subsidise these people,' the minister said. A senior World Bank official said that he was not aware of any complaints by Brazil on this issue. But he admitted that international response to the Amazonian Pilot Programme had been 'disappointing' and that the project would be 'smaller and slower than planned'. Of the money pledged so far, Dollars 19.5m is from Germany and Dollars 15m from the EC. Canada has contributed less than Dollars 1m. The G7 has promised a further Dollars 200m over the next three years, of which 10 per cent must be provided by Brazil. However, the official said 'most of this is bilateral aid already committed by G7 countries. There is almost no additionality, if at all - it's just consolidating old aid in a new account'.
19921202000000000	FT  02 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: A hard nut to crack - Eco-friendly business ventures which pave the way for sustainable development. Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's ice cream company says it all came to him at a rainforest benefit hosted by the Grateful Dead. Eager to help nature but also to make a profit, Cohen saw green when he came across a (legal) organic commodity at the concert: the Brazil nut, a renewable Amazon resource extracted by the Kayapo Indians. Three years later, the US company buys Dollars 1.6m (Pounds 1m) of Brazil nuts from the Kayapo to make its popular Rainforest Crunch ice cream, a vanilla-caramel concoction. Eco-business ventures are a growing though still limited field. They usually follow a two-pronged approach. First, companies source raw materials from ecologically threatened areas around the globe to promote the use of sustainable resources which provide indigenous peoples with foreign capital. Direct investment in the Amazon, for instance, ties the Indians' welfare to the welfare of the rainforest, prompting them to protect it against destructive cutting and burning by developers. Second, businesses can capitalise on the public relations boost in a market where most things 'green' are popular. The firms also often support conservation efforts organised by environmental groups which work with the people. This shift in attitude follows years of distrust. Many businesses are involved in such projects, and no longer stand accused of 'window dressing'. Meanwhile, conservationists now work closely with the local population, who were once considered the problem, to develop products and sell them to interested firms. Cultural Survival, the US non-profit foundation which sold Cohen on the Brazil nut, tries to find buyers for products made by indigenous groups with little access to western markets. The group acts as a trader for 15 commodities from 11 countries to make 125 products. Sales to businesses with 'socially responsible' sourcing practices reach Dollars 2m annually with clients such as The Body Shop, the cosmetics chain, and retailers like Macy's and the Nature Company eager to foster a progressive image. Jason Clay, director of Cultural Survival, acknowledges the trade volume is scant compared with the Third World's development needs and has barely scratched the hidden potential. But he expects his nascent operation, started in 1988, to reach sales of Dollars 50m in five years. Cultural Survival also benefits directly from the sales. Companies agree to pass on 5 per cent of their premium to fund the group's programmes. These include getting indigenous people titles to their land so they will protect it against ruin; and resource management programmes, needed to raise standards of living. Working with local groups to expand commercial opportunity was pioneered during the 1980s by Chico Mendes, the Brazilian rubber tapper murdered in 1988. The Mendes spirit is in evidence in Ecuador's Esmeraldes region where the locals produce tagua, an ivory-like palm nut, that can be used to make buttons. With assistance from Conservation International, another non-profit body, sales to retailers such as Smith-Holkin, LL Bean and Esprit have generated Dollars 75,000. On the surface, this may seem more like charity than business, but the group says its presence has given conservationists needed leverage in local politics. For example, Esmeraldes now has a land-use plan and it successfully opposed a banana plantation development on protected land. The new thinking has also led environmentalists to reassess their staple programmes, such as the popular debt-for-nature swaps which have been criticised for stirring inflationary pressures and creating a market for bad debt that should be forgiven, not bought. Conservation International, which pioneered debt-for-nature swaps in 1987, is using this tool to promote eco-business ventures in Guatemala. Its Dollars 1.4m debt-for-nature swap funds, for the first time, commercial extractive activity. The programme is run in the Maya Biosphere Reserve, a 1.75m-hectare region in the nation's northern Peten province. The local population of some 15,000 Mestizo people, part Spanish and part Indian, depends on the forests' natural endowment. But over-harvesting and deforestation has depleted the forest. Local people are taught proper harvesting techniques that maximise sustainable use of the reserve's three primary non-timber products. 'If they look out over the forest and see their economic future, and the economic future of their children, they become allies in the ecological conservation of their forests,' says Jim Nations of Conservation International.
19921104000000000	FT  04 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: A strange case of jungle fever  -How a billionaire's tropical dream is starting to pay off after 25 years. Mention Jari in Brazilian business circles and people generally raise their eyebrows. As the world's biggest tropical forestry project, Jari is the product of an American shipping magnate's dream to plant trees in the Amazon to produce pulp and paper as well as cultivate rice and raise buffalo. After 25 years, billions of dollars, a lot of ridicule and setbacks, Jari may just be turning into a model for industrial development and silviculture in tropical rainforests. The project, now run by a group of Brazilian companies, is the largest employer in the Amazon and this year expects its first net profit. More important, it is defying the established view that poor Amazonian soil would not support large-scale agroforestry. Arriving at the remote site at the confluence of the Amazon and Jari rivers, it is easy to see why the project was labelled crazy. Accessible only by small aeroplane or slowboat from Belem, 250 miles away, Jari is a bizarre sight. Skimming over lush forest for more than an hour, the aeroplane lands in Monte Dourado, a neat but somewhat out-of-place company town complete with club, hospital and identical houses with front lawns. Drive through the jungle and suddenly at the edge of a muddy river in the middle of nowhere arises a gleaming metal pulp mill and powerplant. Pines that would look more at home in the Swiss alps grow in sandy fields. In cleared areas herds of bemused water buffalo wander, looking as if they would rather be wallowing in the mud far away. Nowadays, environmental concerns mean that permission would never be granted for such a project. But back in the late 1960s Brazil's military rulers were eager to 'colonise' the Amazon, which makes up 60 per cent of national territory. Started in 1967, Jari owes its existence to the determination of the late billionaire Daniel K Ludwig, who loved to do things which everyone said were impossible. Intended as his crowning glory, the scheme to tame the jungle and install a pulp mill, buffalo farm and rice plantation in an area the size of Belgium, was the biggest and craziest of all. Convinced of an impending world food and fibre shortage, Ludwig sent men all over the world in search of the perfect tree for pulp. He also needed a parcel of land near a deep water harbour in a country with cheap labour. Undaunted by its remoteness he settled on Jari, an area of wild jungle populated only by Indians, monkeys and a few rubber-tappers. Inside its 1.6m hectares, Ludwig built a port, railroad, 9,000km of roads and the town of Monte Dourado from scratch, shipping in people from the northeast and industrialised south. The first problem came when the seedlings planted on the newly cleared land promptly died. Already 69 when the project began, Ludwig was in a hurry. Rather than experimenting with many species to see which fared best in the poor Amazonian soil, he risked millions on a monoculture of gmelina, a tree native to India and Burma, chosen because it could be harvested for pulp in just six years. Gmelina was a disaster, succumbing to disease when it finally did grow. In 1973, Ludwig brought in pine trees, planting many thousands of hectares. These, however, grew slowly in the sandy soil and torrential rains. The rice plantation was a dismal failure despite a complicated system of irrigation by dykes. In 1978, undaunted by such setbacks, Ludwig shipped in a Japanese pulp mill with 220,000 tonnes per year capacity. A wood-fired power plant was also ordered, towed by barges across three oceans and up the Amazon in 87 days. A year later, eucalyptus was planted and it is now the main crop, taking up 40 per cent of the 100,000 hectares of planted trees. By this time, Jari had become the focus of Brazilian fears that imperialist foreigners would expropriate the Amazon. Rumours abounded that it was an American military training camp. Unable to find partners or finance, Ludwig had to abandon plans for a second pulp mill and newsprint plant. Jari was put up for sale in 1980 amid a financial and managerial crisis. Ludwig's planned investments of Dollars 300m-Dollars 500m (Pounds 180m-Pounds 300m) had run into billions, while the first year of pulp mill operation in 1979 saw revenues of just Dollars 70m instead of the Dollars 300m he had predicted. In 1982 Jari was bought for around Dollars 300m by a group of 22 Brazilian companies. With the government providing finance and technology in the form of advisers from Embrapa, the Agricultural Research Institute, the Jari company is now producing 291,000 tonnes of pulp per year, of which 80 per cent is exported. This year it will finally move out of the red. The turnaround has been mostly due to the new attention on technical concerns. Facing an imminent lack of wood, the new owners decided to increase the diameter of trees, increase plantation size, and cultivate a type of eucalyptus more suitable to local conditions. Contracted in 1984, Sergio Coutinho, the project's forest adviser, developed a new model. After extensive soil surveys which discovered 23 different soil types, he classified the land depending on how intensely it could stand alteration - low, medium, high or very high - and it is now exploited accordingly. A soil correction programme was initiated as well as cloning to produce the best tree for each area. Coutinho has no illusions about the immensity of the task. 'Man is by nature a destroyer. The big challenge here has been to develop this large frontier of tropical forest differently.' As a result of his work Jari has shown an incredible increase in productivity. Eucalyptus is now yielding an annual 27.7 cu m/hectare - 110 per cent up on 1982; pine 19.9 - 49 per cent up; and gmelina 22.6 - 18.9 per cent up. These results fly in the face of traditional wisdom that the shallow nature of Amazonian soil would cause productivity to decrease, forcing the land to be abandoned as has happened in agricultural projects all over the forest. 'We expected that with such poor soil, the first rotation would grow but then production would fall. Instead we now have areas on their third and fourth rotation and the yield is rising,' Coutinho says. He believes that through forest management combined with adjusting trees to local soil characteristics, average yield could reach 40 cu m/hec by the end of this decade. A natural target of attack by green activists, environmental concerns have top priority at Jari. Dismissing the thesis that the forest should be left untouched as 'absurdly romantic - the people of the Amazon deserve a decent living too,' Coutinho points out that exploited areas account for less than 10 per cent of the total land. Native forest has been left on slopes and around water and in 400m-wide bands between plantations to allow circulation of animals as well as acting as a barrier against the spreading of disease. Eight 20,000-hectare genetic reserves have been created to serve as fully preserved control samples of areas of different forest types to be cut down for economic activity. Coutinho's team has catalogued more than 629 species of trees, all of which are monitored in situ. Nevertheless, the sight of rows of spindly eucalyptus replacing centuries old Amazonian trees is shocking. But Eduardo Barreto, president of the Jari company, says: 'Producing pulp in the Amazon exposes you to fire, but criticism is based on ignorance. We have four hectares of native forest for every one of planted forest. We are protecting biodiversity and proving that it's possible to generate an environmentally friendly and economically sound business in the Amazon.' Ludwig's dream of taming the jungle may not have been realised, nor would anyone cite Jari as the solution to the Amazon's development problem, but after 25 years of hard work and enormous amounts of money at least it is providing an example.
19930303000000000	FT  03 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Exploiting the rainforest - Local indians, oilmen and conservationists have formed an uneasy alliance in Ecuador. Down in the Oriente, Ecuador's Amazon rainforest, US oilmen and local indians have decided to put aside their differences and enter into a controversial partnership aimed at exploiting the environment without destroying it. After years of intense battling between oil companies, conservationists, the Ecuadorian government and indigenous groups, Maxus Energy, a US oil company, has been given final authorisation to develop block 16, a 200,000-hectare government concession in the Oriente. The reason for this controversy is that part of the Maxus concession lies in Yasuni national park, one of the most pristine and biologically diverse areas left in the Amazon forest. Also, block 16 is in the territory of the Huaorani indians, one of the few tribes left in Amazonia living in relative seclusion from the industrialised world. The park has been declared an international biosphere reserve by Unesco. The government's permission to build an access road and oil pipeline through the rainforest is part of a new policy which seeks to exploit natural resources even in protected areas, an activity permitted by Ecuadorian law. The authorisation was one of the last hurdles for the consortium headed by Dallas-based Maxus to overcome. Conoco, which originally headed the consortium and conducted exploratory work, abandoned the field last year because of government indecision, opposition by conservationists and fresh opportunities elsewhere. One driving force behind the environmental lobby, besides the area's ecological and tribal importance, was the knowledge that oil companies operating in the Oriente had previously caused enormous destruction and distrust. A report co-authored by the National Resource Defence Council in Washington DC documented the extent of river and soil pollution, excess deforestation and catastrophic health effects on the indigenous people in the Oriente. According to government estimates, up to 4,200 gallons of oil per day are discharged into the environment, equalling 19m gallons in the past two decades. Against this background and under the requirements of a new federal law on oil operations, Maxus proposed an environmental plan which it argued would minimise the negative impact on the environment and the local people and serve as a model project for rainforest areas. By reducing the width of the access road from 100m to 25m, including a subterranean pipeline, and using more synthetic materials and fewer tree trunks for the road base, Maxus claims the usual deforestation rate for such roads has been reduced sharply. It plans to minimise deforestation further by using clustered well sites rather than having a separate site and road for each individual well. A reforestation project is under way - seedlings are being cultivated to replace the trees cut down. A significant previous concern had been that oil companies moving into the Amazon forest opened the way for settlers, who multiplied the deforestation rate by slash-and-burn horticulture. Maxus plans to install guarded control posts along access roads and river crossings to prevent settlers entering the area. However, until Maxus has had time to comply fully with the plan, environmentalists will remain distrustful, remembering years of oil company abuses in the rainforest. Also, questions remain over the long-term impact. Will the pipeline have enough safety valves to minimise the repercussions of a possible oil spill? Is a complete regeneration of the forest area possible? Can the habitat of rare and endangered species be regenerated? The local environmental group, Accion Ecologica, argues that the effect of machinery noise and deforestation on many species that require specific breeding grounds is unknown. Yet more mainstream conservationists, while also opposed to the project, are trying to minimise the impact of the oil operations by participating in the process. 'Seeing that the decision to exploit oil in block 16 has been taken, we are now working to make the project as environmentally sustainable as possible,' says Danila Silva of EcoCiencia, an environmental research group. Maxus has overcome previous opposition to the project by some of the indigenous groups whose livelihood depends on the forest. Through direct negotiations between Maxus and certain groups of the Huaorani indians, both sides have avoided political intermediaries and come to a working agreement. Maxus will provide community services and infrastructure to the Huaoranis. It will also limit helicopter flights over the area to avoid disturbing wildlife, and prohibit employees from bringing in alcohol or pornographic material. Having experienced the first Maxus community projects, many Huaoranis see a chance to benefit from the venture while preserving their culture. 'The way to protect our way of life and our culture is by reinforcing our historical awareness, our language and our customs,' says Enqueri, a Huaorani leader. 'Through the schools and health centres that Maxus builds, we have this opportunity.' However, further east, the Tagaeri tribe, which retains its semi-nomadic existence and has refused attempts at contact, remains hostile to oil companies and all development efforts. For the more acculturated Huaoranis, the contingency plan developed in case of an oil spill, says Enqueri, is to go en masse to the Maxus headquarters to denounce their agreement with the company. Of the Dollars 752m (Pounds 530m) that Maxus will invest in block 16, about Dollars 50m is earmarked for environmental protection measures, says Boris Abad, its government relations official. The government is investing 57 per cent of the project's total cost, estimated at Dollars 2.2bn. Maxus expects to produce 220m barrels of heavy crude over the next 20 years. The initiative shown by Maxus so far in protecting the environment and indigenous communities in block 16 is an improvement over previous oil ventures in the Oriente. Yet whether it can be called a model environmental operation in the rainforest will depend on an assessment of the area in a decade.
19931130000000000	FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green cloud hangs over Ecuadorean oil sector - Raymond Colitt reports on a wave of protest that has potential investors worried. Only months before the Ecuadorean government is to invite foreign oil companies to bid for new exploration blocks in the country's Amazon region - potentially worth billions of dollars - a new wave of protests by environmentalists and indigenous groups has investors worried. The latest in a series of actions against oil companies in the region came earlier this month as several aboriginal communities filed a civil law suit against the US oil company Texaco. The Indians of various tribes in the Amazon forests are demanding of Texaco an indemnity in addition to legal costs of at least USDollars 50,000 for each of the affected inhabitants of the area, which could run into thousands of people. Separately the plaintiffs are to claim clean-up costs that may, according to some estimates, reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Texaco is accused of negligence, recklessness and intentional damage in its exploration and production activities. These are alleged to have increased the risk of cancer, respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses and to have caused other personal injuries and property damages. According to Mr Cristobal Bonifaz, a lawyer for the Indians, Texaco did not always employ technologies and practices that met industry standards. For example, toxic substances, he said, were not disposed of properly, but were rather 'dumped' into pits, rivers and bogs or burnt without any pollution control. Mr Bonifaz adds that the environmental damage in Ecuador's Amazon region far exceeds that caused by the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska three years ago. Texaco has not operated in the fields of the Oriente, as Ecuador's Amazonian region is called, since 1990, when its contract with the Ecuadorean government expired and it withdrew after 20 years as the principal operator from a consortium with the state-owned Petroecuador. The US petroleum company denies the allegations and argues that the case should have been filed in Ecuador, where Petroecuador is legally established. Yet the plaintiffs argue that the defendant is legally a resident of New York and that all decisions regarding operations in Ecuador were essentially taken in the US. Meanwhile, Texaco awaits the results of an environmental audit initiated by the Ecuadorean government itself to determine exactly what environmental damage has been caused and what the reparation cost might be. The results of a study conducted by a Canadian environmental consulting firm are expected soon. Ecuador's minister of energy and mining, Mr Franciso Acosta, says that he will not sign any new contract with Texaco - which seeks to commercialise petrol within Ecuador - until the environmental review has been completed and Texaco has renewed its commitment to abide by it. The validity of the audit has been questioned by environmental groups in the US and Ecuador because of the lack of public access to information, the exclusion of local communities from the process and the terms of the audit, which were set by Texaco and Petroecuador. Laws and regulations that might substantiate specific infractions against Texaco are scarce. Ecuador has only recently adopted environmental regulations specific to the petroleum industry. Yet first the court for the southern district of New York must be signed to hear the case. That considerable environmental damage has been caused in the Oriente is beyond question. Countless acres of rain forest have disappeared, water and soil have been polluted by oil spills and animal habitats have been destroyed. According to a government estimate nearly 17m gallons of oil has leaked out of the Texaco-operated pipeline. Preliminary results from an independent study by the US-based Institute on Economic and Social Rights indicates that in areas in which Texaco operated there is evidence of the presence of toxic substances like benzine and toluol in excess of levels deemed tolerable by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Yet the company maintains that its emergency clean-up efforts were effective and that oil spills, often due to natural disasters, represented only a small percentage of the total amount transported during 18 years of operation. Texaco is not the only company accused of environmental improprieties. Only days before the legal suit against Texaco, members of the Cofan tribe - armed with spears and shotguns - forced drilling to be suspended at a Petroecuador site. The Cofanes demanded that the exploratory work within a national park and close to their tribal lands be halted. Especially indignant at President Duran Ballen's decision to allow resumption of exploratory work after having previously suspended it because of environmental concerns, they contended that they were not consulted about the activities as is required by law. Confrontation is certain to continue as the Cofanes insist that Petroecuador withdraw from their lands. Petroecuador has already had to shut down one of its most promising sites - Tiputini Panacocha, also located in the national park - following a decree by the government's environmental agency in response to supposed damage. Despite assurances to potential investors by the energy minister, potentially interested oil companies are wary of increasing confrontation by indigenous peoples and environmental groups that might lead to costly legal battles and an image problem at home.
19940723000000000	FT  23 JUL 94 / Raytheon secures deal to monitor Amazon. A consortium led by the US electronics company and defence manufacturer Raytheon has won a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 700m) contract to build a technological surveillance system in the Amazon rain forest. The Brazilian government rejected a French bid, represented by Thomson and Alcatel, to supply and install the Amazon Surveillance System (Sivam). A statement from the Brazilian president's office on Thursday evening said the Raytheon tender was technologically and financially superior. The contract includes the supply of radar equipment, aircraft and communication networks, which will be used to monitor the Amazon for environmental research, including deforestation, as well as for airspace and border control and combating drug trafficking in the region. The Raytheon consortium includes MacDonald Dettwiler of Canada, Westinghouse Electric, the University of New Hampshire and the Brazilian operations of International Business Machines (IBM). It also includes the Brazilian government-controlled aircraft manufacturer Embraer. The Brazilian government will receive eight years grace on payment and a further 10 years to pay for the contract, which will be financed by the US Eximbank, according to Mr Esteve Ortis, president of Esca, the Brazilian company coordinating the project. Mr Ortis said that the financing proposals offered by both consortiums were 'unbelievably good.' Brazilian companies, particularly Embraer, will be responsible for supplying about 40 per cent of the contract value, he said. The US and French bids were shortlisted in May after the government rejected tenders from the US's Unisys Corp and a joint bid by Germany's Deutsche Aerospace and Italy's Alenia. Both the US and French governments lobbied strongly for the contract. Last October Mr Gerard Longuet, French trade and industry minister, visited Brazil and last month Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, led a trade mission to the country. The Sivam project is described by the Brazilian government as 'the largest and most complex attempt to monitor the environment anywhere in the world.' It will be made up of a network of fixed and mobile radar, aircraft and satellite monitoring and a communications network. The system will be controlled from the capital Brasilia, with centres in the towns of Manaus, Belem and Porto Velho.
19941109000000000	FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (27): Ambitious government plan - The environment / Raymond Colitt examines forestry issues. For centuries, Bolivia's natural resources have been exploited in a free-for-all manner - usually lacking any environmental concern. Today, the economy is still heavily resource dependent and excessive environmental degradation is common. The government, in an ambitious plan developed by the new Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment, is attempting to introduce the sustainable or rational use of natural resources without sacrificing economic growth. The challenges are daunting. Extreme poverty, powerful agro-industrial enterprises and a general ignorance of environmental issues are the principal causes of Bolivia's ecological problem. The question is, will the government have the resources and political power to enforce its scheme? On the winding road from Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia, trucks head westward loaded with enormous trunks of tropical timber, winding their way up the Andean slopes. These shipments, usually made up of mahogany from Bolivia's vast Amazon rain forest, are destined for export. 'Forests cover 50 per cent of Bolivia's territory, providing the woodworking sector with an immense natural resource. . .' reads an investment brochure for Bolivia. Indeed, the wood industry, which increases the country's income for each tree felled, is growing steadily. But manufactured wood products, such as doors, make up only only a small proportion of the income from exports: Dollars 7.2m of the Dollars 52m total wood exports last year. Mr Juan Carlos Quiroga, secretary of natural resources, says: 'Brazil extracts the same amount of mahogany as Bolivia does, but by processing it they earn Dollars 200m instead of Dollars 45m like we do.' What makes Bolivia's wood industry 'unsustainable', however, is that virtually none of the wood exported today comes from reforested areas, so that the country's stock of forest simply dwindles until it disappears. In addition, says Mr Gonzalo Flores of the forest conservation programme Probona, 'companies evade paying the proper taxes and have management plans rubber-stamped by corrupt officials. A legislative proposal presently before congress is to institute a 40-year concession on forested areas in exchange for annual fees per hectare of between seventy cents and Dollars 1.30, replacing the present tax per square foot of lumber, which was easily evaded. Management plans requiring a more reasonable extraction of timber would be reviewed by international consultants and approved by a high-level ministerial council. The idea is that the concession would be revoked if timber companies exploited the area irrationally. Wood industry leaders are sceptical about the new law. Mr Carlos Miguel Gagliardi, general manager of the industrial wood company Cimal, says: 'the per hectare tax will drive up our cost because now we have to conduct expensive inventory studies to be sure of the amount of marketable timber.' Mr Cristobal Roda, whose family made its fortune in wood extraction, says he realises the need for serious forestry management. 'We have to think of the future because my factory and our people's jobs are at stake.' Yet few wood companies have long-term investments. 'The majority operate only with a skidder, a caterpillar and a saw mill,' says Mr Gagliardi. 'Our intention is to get these companies to think of long-term strategies rather than just short-term profits,' says Mr Juan Carlos Quiroga. The problem, reply industry representatives, is that so far government policies have not been very consistent. Neither does the proposed idea of concessions promote reforestation, they say. 'There won't be much interest in reforestation if we can't own the land,' says Mr Roda.
19941130000000000	FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Amazon's saviour - A project that provides constant monitoring of the world's biggest rainforest. By early next century, if the government and a handful of private contractors finish the job in time, Brazil will be ready to tackle its biggest public relations problem - a reputation for abusing the Amazon. Environmentalists claim that illegal logging, delays in marking out Indian lands and environmentally-damaging mining are likely to continue, but the Brazilian government will have a trump card to play against any critical environmental lobbyists: Sivam. Sivam, or the System for Vigilance over the Amazon, is one of the most ambitious environmental projects in the world. Set to cost about Dollars 1.39bn (Pounds 840m) and take five years to install, it is a network of radars, satellites and ground sensors which will be linked to provide constant monitoring over Brazil's share of the Amazon basin, an area which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the country and is about 10 times bigger than France. Sivam will, for the first time, provide accurate and widespread information on the Amazon's environment and how it is changing. It will provide evidence to counteract what the Brazilian government considers exaggerated or misleading reports about sensitive subjects such as deforestation. It will also, thanks to improved air traffic and radar systems, help in the fight against drug smuggling and unlicenced mining. These measures are likely to be welcomed by environmental groups. But Sivam's ultimate aim is more controversial. The information gathered by the system will form the basis for Brazil's development of the region into the next century. Brigadier Marcos Antonio de Oliveira, who will be appointed president of the commission overseeing Sivam, says that accurate information is vital if Brazil is to plan for the 'sustained development' of an area as vulnerable as the Amazon. He adds that Brazil wants to match the wealth enjoyed by countries in the north, and it is not feasible to make the Amazon immune from development. 'The Amazon's resources will be used sooner or later, whatever happens. What we need to do is develop it rationally. But it must be left to Brazil to decide when and how to use these resources,' he says. The Sivam project, announced at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, was designed partly to deflect criticism over Brazil's environmental record. Its supporters said better communications could strengthen the government's hand in the Amazon, where edicts to stop environmental damage were rarely carried out, mainly because of the region's size and poor communications. Government, environmental and Indian rights agencies were often blocked by local leaders involved in illegal activities. The tender for installing Sivam was won in July by a consortium led by Raytheon, the US group. Raytheon will start work on a project plan with its main Brazilian partner, computer and control company ESCA, once the contract is signed with the Brazilian government. Antonio de Almeida Filho, an ESCA director, said he hoped the contract would be signed this year, once financing is approved by the Senate. Sivam's main weapon will be at least 300 monitoring stations - de Oliveira says the number could double - which will monitor up to 17 characteristics such as air and water quality or humidity. The stations will transmit regular readings via radio or fixed telecommunications links to three regional processing centres, in turn co-ordinated in the capital Brasilia. Monitoring will have several immediate uses. Soil traces in the Amazon's river systems could be analysed to track down illegal mining, and to measure damage caused by legal excavation. Water and air pollution from large towns, such as Manaus, will be assessed. The Amazon's weather systems, which are still poorly understood, will also be recorded in detail for the first time and climatic change across the area will be measurable. A network of long-range radars will be installed to watch Brazil's borders and to improve air traffic control over main air corridors. In other areas, especially those close to drug shipment sites near Colombia and the Brazilian state of Acre, air movements will be monitored by airborne radar likely to be installed on aircraft made by Embraer, the Brazilian manufacturer. Aerial detection will also be important for monitoring forest fires. Brazil currently uses satellite photographs provided by its space research institute. However, de Oliveira says three spotter planes will photograph fires so that information can be gathered and assessed more quickly to help provide evidence against individuals accused of starting them. Fires are often used to clear an area of forest for agriculture or other purposes. According to some specialists, 0.5 per cent of the Amazon basin is cut down or burnt a year. Government critics argue that Sivam will make only a limited difference because, even when the government has information about the Amazon, it rarely acts. For example, wildcat miners operate illegally in several demarcated Indian areas, sometimes with the apparent knowledge of local authorities. One environmental adviser says Sivam will be constrained without a government commitment to prosecute illegal activities in the Amazon, and crack down on corruption in local justice and police departments. De Oliveira argues this is not the case. The problem, he says, is that when the government does have reliable information, it is not co-ordinated within public departments, a failure Sivam will resolve. 'Sivam, by providing better information, will strengthen the public institutions in the Amazon. We want to strengthen the communities living there, not just the indigenous people, but the workers living there and the immigrants who have settled there,' he says. At the same time, facts and figures for assessing how best to develop the area will be stored and analysed. 'The Amazon will have to be developed, but what we have to do is respect its fragility,' he says.
19890122000000000	SLAIN BRAZILIAN BECOMES SYMBOL; BATTLE FOR HUGE AMAZON FOREST IS TURNING DEADLY. Francisco Mendes, 44, grew up in the forest and spent most of his life plying its shaded paths, gathering natural latex and Brazil nuts to earn a meager living. Like thousands of other rubber tappers in the Amazon basin, Mendes loved the peace and tranquillity of forest life. His conservation efforts earned him an international reputation -- and perhaps caused his death. When a 20-gauge shotgun blast killed Mendes last Dec. 22, Xapuri rubber tappers lost their leader -- and the Amazon conservation movement lost one of its most effective spokesmen. But here in Mendes' native state of Acre, rubber tappers and conservationists have much cause for hope. Contrary to what is happening in some other parts of the Amazon, where the forest is being slashed and burned at an alarming rate, those who want to save Acre's forest seem to be winning. In the 3,000 square miles of Xapuri township, for example, only 133 acres of forest were destroyed last year. In some cases, demonstrations organized by Mendes' Rural Workers Union stopped chain-saw crews before they could start cutting. Statewide, the rate of deforestation has declined sharply in recent years, and the state government has adopted a policy that strongly discourages the conversion of forest into ranchland. Some officials in Rio Branco, the state capital, say that increasingly successful conservation efforts in Acre could serve as a model for the rest of the Amazon basin. The basin is drained by the biggest river system in the world and is blanketed by the Earth's largest tropical rain forest. Scientists say the forest plays a vital role in atmospheric and climatic conditions around the globe. In Brazil, the Amazon basin covers 2 million square miles, a region 12 times as large as California. According to rough estimates based on satellite surveys, as much as 30,000 square miles of virgin Amazon forest are being destroyed in Brazil every year as roadways, cattle ranching, farming, logging, mining and hydroelectric projects spread through the region.  Isolated Area Acre, remote and isolated in Brazil's far west, has lost only 6% of its forest, which once virtually covered the state's 59,000 square miles. Most of Acre's deforestation has been on the eastern wing-tip of the butterfly-shaped state, around Rio Branco and along the road to Xapuri and Brasileia near the Bolivian border. A road network that was planned to lace the rest of Acre has not been built because of lack of funds. About 80% of the state's territory is privately owned, and pressure is strong for spreading pastureland into the wilderness. It was this kind of pressure that Francisco Mendes was resisting. Known by the nickname Chico, Mendes was the son of a rubber tapper and began tapping rubber trees himself at age 9. He never went beyond fourth grade in school but received an informal education from a Communist and one-time army lieutenant who had participated in a ragtag rebel army's long march through Brazil's hinterlands in the 1920s. "He had a very good ideological base from that guy," said Gumersindo Rodrigues, 29, who worked closely with Mendes in the union. Mendes helped found the union and served on the Xapuri municipal council in the late 1970s. He also founded a local branch of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party. For Mendes, the causes of socialism, unionism and ecology all placed him in direct opposition to the big landowners and ranchers. When the Rural Workers Union heard that a landowner had sent a crew to clear a piece of forest, the union would muster its members and their families to create an empate, or standoff. Dozens, even hundreds, of men, women and children would gather around the cutting crew and prevent it from starting the job.  Killing Threatened In one such action last year, the union prevented brothers Alvarino and Darly Alves da Silva from starting work on a road into their isolated ranch outside the town of Xapuri. The ranchers had threatened to kill the union leader, Xapuri residents say. Mendes did not take it as an idle threat. He and Rodrigues, his friend and union associate, had learned of an outstanding warrant in the southern state of Parana charging the Alves da Silva brothers with ordering the killing of two rural workers there. Mendes and Rodrigues had the warrant transferred to Xapuri, and the brothers went into hiding. Mendes was put under police protection. Two police guards were eating a fish dinner in Mendes' rustic Xapuri home Dec. 22 when Mendes opened the door on his way to take a shower in an outbuilding. Mendes was shot in the chest; he staggered back into the house and died. The police began looking for members of the Alves da Silva family. Darly and two of his sons turned themselves in. One of them, Darcy, confessed to pulling the trigger. The police are still searching the jungle for Alvarino Alves da Silva and three hired pistoleiros said to be with him.  Brazil Nut Trees Survive Xapuri is about 50 miles from the border by the BR-317, a rutted, red-dirt road that becomes impassable after heavy rains. Most of the road from Xapuri to Rio Branco, a stretch of about 110 miles, is paved. It is flanked by ranches on rolling land, grassy pastures dotted with stumps and, occasionally, a green-topped castanheira, a Brazil nut tree. The castanheiras were left standing because government regulations prohibit their being cut down. But in isolation from the forest they are usually sterile -- towering but useless reminders of an ineffectual official gesture. Xapuri (pronounced shah-poo-REE) was once the capital of Acre, long before the territory became a state. Its brick and asphalt streets are lined with wood houses, many of them on stilts. One of the biggest buildings in town has been preserved as a landmark. It was the headquarters of the Bolivian provincial government before Brazil bought Acre in 1903.  Rubber Barons That was at the time of the rubber boom, when Amazon latex fed burgeoning tire industries in the United States and Europe. Rubber barons made huge fortunes from the sticky sap that jungle workers painstakingly tapped from the trees, cutting groove after groove in a slanting pattern down the stout trunks. Tappers made their rounds on forest paths just as they do today. During the rainy season, they gather pods of Brazil nuts, and between seasons they cultivate corn, beans and cassava in small jungle clearings. Most tappers still live in thatch-roofed shacks deep in the forest, far from civilization. After the BR-317 came to Xapuri and cattle ranches began spreading out from the road, hundreds of rubber tappers were forced to abandon their source of livelihood, the forest. Others sold their tapping rights, discouraged by depressed rubber prices. Today, many former tappers live in the slums of Rio Branco, trying to make a living as unskilled laborers, but an estimated 120,000 of the state's 380,000 people are still rubber tappers and their dependents.  Resisting Ranchers The Rural Workers Union of Xapuri was formed to resist the encroachment of cattle ranching and to improve the lot of rubber tappers as well as ranch hands. Many of the tappers have little opportunity to participate in union activities. "The most distant ones stay out years and years without coming into town," Rodrigues said. But he said 600 of the estimated 3,000 rubber tappers in Xapuri township are active union members, dedicated to preserving the forest. "Between death from hunger in the city and death from fighting for the forest, we will die fighting for the forest," he said. Rodrigues and others who lived and worked with Mendes are clear about who their enemies are: the ranchers. "They meant to finish off the forest, and Chico defended it," said Mendes' widow, Ilzamar. "They didn't accept that." Gilson Pescador, a Xapuri labor organizer and former priest, said that Mendes' killing was planned as an attack on the conservation movement.  A Tree in the Cause "That was the motive, to end the movement, to end the resistance," Pescador told a visitor in the offices of the Workers' Party. Pescador wore a new T-shirt that said, "They cut down one of the leafiest trees in the Amazon cause and the union movement. Chico Mendes, from your example other bold plants will spring, until the entire Earth is green." In Rio Branco, landowner Sergio Figueiredo argued that there can be forest conservation in Acre along with the development of ranching and farming. "There is room for everyone here," he said. The law limits landowners to clearing the forest from no more than 50% of their property, but Figueiredo said that an average of only about 20% of large ranches have been deforested. Figueiredo, 36, said that most Acre residents want new roads and increased food production, which would reduce the remote state's high cost of living and provide new jobs.  People 'Need to Be Fed' "We believe that Acre, one of the most fertile parts of Brazil, cannot be kept just to be admired when there are residents who need to be fed," he said. According to Figueiredo, the slaying of Mendes was the result of a "strictly personal" dispute between Mendes and the Alves da Silva family. Mendes' friends and associates say it was part of a violent conflict between rubber tappers and others who want to preserve the forest and ranchers who want to destroy it. The struggle has cost several other lives in Acre, they say. But Figueiredo said that when a rubber tapper is killed in a personal quarrel, "ranchers are always seen as the guilty ones. . . . There is a political interest in throwing the working class up against the landowner class." The ranchers' point of view was supported by the Acre state government until 1986, when Flaviano Melo was elected governor. Melo, a member of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, is the first governor in the Amazon region to adopt a clearly conservationist policy. His main adviser on economic development, Gilberto Siqueira, heads the Acre State Technological Foundation, which has drawn up a plan for exploiting the forest while preserving it.  22 Research Projects The foundation is conducting 22 research projects on forest management, use of forest products and technology for extraction. In addition to latex and Brazil nuts, Siqueira said, Acre's forests abound with valuable woods, oils, resins, fruits and medicinal plants. Despite the ranchers' contention that Acre's soil is fertile, Siqueira said studies have shown that it is weak and not suitable for agriculture. He said much pastureland cleared in the 1970s will no longer support grass and is being taken over by weeds. The key to preserving the forest, according to Siqueira, is to make it economically productive. The state has recently created four "extractive reserves" totaling more than 700,000 acres that cannot be deforested. More reserves will be set aside, he said. At the same time, Siqueira's foundation is trying to bring about the creation of industries in Rio Branco that will use rubber, selected hardwoods and other forest products for manufacturing. "I don't believe in any ecological proposal that doesn't translate into an economic answer," he said in an interview. "You cannot preserve the forest and let it sit static."
19890312000000000	THE COUSTEAU WATCH: ENVIRONMENTALIST PAYS WITH HIS LIFE. When I got the message, my mind was not on murder. In the intense heat, humidity dripped down the windshield of the truck. In the dark night of the Brazilian Amazon, the words relayed by my friend were startling: "Tell Cousteau if he ever comes back here, he'll never get out alive." At first I thought I hadn't heard him correctly. But it was shockingly true. I had received a warning from the cocaine underworld -- an underworld eager to protect its coca fields in the Amazon. Apparently, I had become a marked person because our expedition teams were making inquiries about the Amazon cocaine trade. At that moment, the reality I had been vaguely sensing for months pierced the curtain of jungle: The lawless want the Amazon, at any price. The threat to my life dissipated. But Francisco (Chico) Mendes Filho was not so fortunate. Mendes made his living tapping latex from trees. During his long career of environmental activism, he helped unionize rubber tappers and ranch hands in the wild Brazilian Amazon state of Acre and served on his local town council. He vehemently protested the clearing of dense Amazon forest, not only because deforestation meant the destruction of rubber trees and his livelihood, but also because he deeply cared about the future of the region. In 1987, he even traveled to Washington to try to persuade the Inter-American Bank to cancel a loan that would enable Brazil to pave a vast highway through the heart of virgin Acre jungle. According to a spokesman for the bank, he was instrumental in persuading the bank that indigenous Amazonian cultures and large areas of forest needed better protection. Thanks largely to the efforts of Mendes, the loan was held in abeyance until the bank could be satisfied that environmental concerns were being properly addressed. As of late February, 1989, the loan remained frozen. In working to restructure the loan, Mendes dreamed instead of international financing for projects that would wisely use the Amazon -- such as mass cultivation of medicinal plants, nuts and other native crops. By September, 1987, there had already been at least five threats on Chico Mendes' life. He was a particular nuisance to Amazon cattle ranchers, who clear-cut vast tracts of trees to graze cattle for beef to be exported, mostly to developed countries. On Dec. 22, 1988, lawlessness finally had its way. The 44-year-old Mendes was assassinated by a band of cattle ranchers whose operations he had long opposed. Several suspects were arrested, one rancher's son confessed to the shooting, and the search continues for others. But arrests alone would not close the case. As a friend in Brazil said: "Big people and big money killed Chico Mendes." As I traveled through the Amazon, I was always amazed at the grandeur of the countless rivers, always humbled by the vastness of the green sea of trees. I was always aware that in this primeval forest, in supposedly savage wilderness, a natural order prevailed. It is modern society that seems uncivilized, noisy and destructive. Of course, I too appreciate progress. It is indeed helpful to be able to call New York or Paris, or even Calypso from a direct-dial phone in a dusty Amazonian frontier town. Development can bring creature comforts to the wild. But in the Amazon, the lust for profit has brought wild development. Chico Mendes fought this Amazon fever. He tried to stop unbridled deforestation, but the stakes had climbed too high. He was murdered because he had become an international figure -- a hero to those who want to protect the resources of our planet -- and because his effectiveness was taking money out of pockets. His death was a terrifying reminder that those who stand in the way of the rapacious risk their lives. Others have been killed and many more intimidated for trying to stand in the way of the anarchy that modern man has brought to Amazonia. Had Mendes not crusaded publicly, his death would have gone unnoticed. It will be shameful if environmentalism has to work "underground" to keep its leaders alive, if environmentalists have to wear hoods and go nameless lest they be shot and put out of the way; if anyone whose voice grows strong enough to be heard by the powerful has to go into hiding. When I heard of Chico Mendes' death, I felt it could have been me. Through his murder, I felt morally mobilized. Surely I am not alone. Mendes will be replaced and his movement will continue. An idea cannot be shot. The killers pulled the trigger on Chico Mendes, but greed and ignorance made the gun. Mendes clearly understood that we have only one Amazon forest, one water system, one habitable globe. So that his death shall not have been for nothing, his vision must remain ours.
19900325000000000	EXPERTS MAP STRATEGY TO CONTROL DEVELOPMENT IN AMAZON RAIN FOREST. The chaotic development that is gobbling up the Amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan developed by officials of Amazon countries and leading scientists from around the world. "That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain forest in recent years," said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist at the Smithsonian Institution and an Amazon specialist. "It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing to read about conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil, except bad news," Lovejoy said in a recent interview. Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest, lies in Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight surrounding countries. Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in mid-January in Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people in the heart of the Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's once-thriving rubber trade. The workshop, which brought together all the governments and scientists with interests in the rain forest, culminated with a plan to regulate development in up to 80% of the Amazon region. It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation priorities, the meeting's participants said. The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for national conservation programs, participants said. Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called multiple-use development, which preserves the forest while allowing tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle ranching or farming, has been ambivalent about the need to conserve the Amazon. Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the setting of priorities was "all done with the blessing of Brazil," Lovejoy said. Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands of plant and animal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30% of the world's plant and animal species. One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken from the deep shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants representing 50 species. Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives without ever setting foot on the ground. One group of orchid species grows only near the top of the canopy; an entirely different collection of orchids grows at the bottom. At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small groups to assess conservation priorities. Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators. Mammalogists took inventory of the Amazon's screeching monkeys. Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same. Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the Amazon. When they were done, the areas determined to be worth saving covered 70% to 80% of the Amazon. "The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no way of getting around that," said Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International and an authority on endangered monkeys. Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves, along with multiple-use areas where some development could occur. It is not realistic to build a fence around 70% to 80% of the Amazon, he said. Only the most critical areas should be placed off limits to development. "Ten (percent) to 20% of the entire Amazon should be in protected parks or preserves, ideally," he said. At present, 2% of the Amazon is protected. Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan. "The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards the work that has got to be done," said Stanley Malone, director of the Suriname Forest Service. Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978 to develop a unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone said. What the officials lacked, however, was a guide to which areas most need protection. That determination has now been made, based on the number of different species a given area contains, and on how many of those species are unique to the area. "Now we'll have to see what develops from this," Mittermeier said. A new Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, was inaugurated this month, and with him comes a new Brazilian environmental policy. Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is uncertain. "As always, everything depends on key individuals," Mittermeier said. "I'm basically always optimistic," he said. "I feel sure that we can develop appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of work."
19890407000000000	THE WORLD. Brazil's President Jose Sarney announced a plan to protect the Amazon rain forest and castigated those who accuse Brazil of destroying the world's largest wilderness. Features of the plan include the creation of a national fund for environmental protection, suspension of subsidies for cattle ranchers in the Amazon Basin and new controls on pesticides. The government said the program, called "Our Nature," will have a budget of $178 million in its first year. "We are accused of something we cannot accept -- of destroying our own territory," Sarney said. "Our priority is the conservation of our ecological heritage."
19890423000000000	BRAZIL TRIES TO STOP SLASH-AND-BURN DESTRUCTION OF RICH AMAZON FORESTS. Here in the state of Rondonia on the southern flank of the great Amazon rain forest, a new frontier opened up in the late 1970s. Encouraged for a decade by the Brazilian government, hundreds of thousands of settlers came to help push back the wilderness and share the bounty. Rondonia was the land of opportunity, the Golden West of Brazil. Now the heady frontier spirit has faded and a new realism seems to be setting in. Slash-and-burn farming and ranching has stripped away as much as one-third of the forest that once protected Rondonia's soil from the baking sun and leaching rains. The state's jungle Indian population has dwindled from 40,000 to 5,000, according to a study by Brazilian anthropologist Cecilia Meireles. Small farmers who thought Rondonia promised an escape from poverty have failed to improve their lot. Malaria is a frequent visitor at makeshift rural homes. Porto Velho, the state capital, is crowded with slum dwellers who gave up on the land. Although the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a frontier development program called Polonoroeste, farmers have received little technical or financial aid. More than half the land they have cleared is uncultivated and has given way to a matted growth of secondary brush called capoeira. Like other areas on the Amazon frontier, Rondonia obviously hasn't turned out the way it was supposed to. Officials here don't need foreign conservationists to tell them that, but in the past year, European and American worries about destruction of the Amazon forest have poured down on Brazil like tropical rain. Perhaps because of the international pressure, perhaps because it makes sense, Brazilian authorities are adopting new policies aimed at slowing the destruction. Some conservationists are skeptical about the effectiveness of the policies, but at least on paper, preservation is becoming the new official watchword in the Amazon region of Brazil. President Jose Sarney has announced a series of protective measures in a program called "Our Nature." One new decree suspends official credits and tax breaks that had encouraged cattle ranchers to turn forest into pasture. The program also includes a zoning study that would put huge forest areas off-limits to ranchers, farmers, loggers and miners. The Rondonia state government already has its own zoning plan. Approved last June, it limits agricultural activities largely to central and southern areas of the state where most deforestation has taken place and where soils are richest. Vice Gov. Orestes Muniz, also Rondonia's planning secretary, says that by recovering millions of acres gone to capoeira, the state can save vast areas of virgin forest from the wasteful slash-and-burn cycle. Technicians are also experimenting with the use of capoeira as cover for crops that require shade, such as coffee and fruit trees. Muniz said the zoning plan sets aside about 60% of the state's territory as natural preserves. To enforce protective measures, the state police force has created a forest patrol unit that now employs 350 officers and eventually will have 1,000. A freeze on all deforestation is in effect, pending implementation of the plan. Thirty percent of the state is designated as extractive reserves and managed forests, where rubber, Brazil nuts, medicinal plants and selected hardwoods and other products can be harvested without deforestation. Officials say the potential for economic returns is great. Rondonia woodlands contain an estimated 40,000 plant species, only about a tenth of which have been classified and studied. Another 30% of preserved forest area includes natural parks and Indian lands. To implement the plan, the state is starting a program called Planafloro, with projects for education, technical aid and financing to help people to preserve the forest while exploiting its riches. "To the extent that the small producer gets income from the standing forest, he will not cut more down," said Teodorico Rocha, a federal official helping on the Planafloro. Planafloro will cost an estimated $213 million, and the national government is negotiating for a loan from the World Bank to cover part of the cost. Rocha said it is "absurd" for Brazil to increase the heavy burden of its $115 billion foreign debt, but the country cannot afford to pay for the conservation program by itself. "There is consciousness for preserving the environment in Rondonia," he said. "What is lacking are the means, financing." In an emotional speech this month, President Sarney appealed to foreigners who accuse Brazil of destroying the Amazon to help provide the means for preserving it. "Transfer technology to us without costs," Sarney said. "Help us to combat the burning with airplanes, with equipment, with products. Help us to reforest with material, scientific and human resources." Foreign aid alone cannot prevent further destruction in the Amazon by economic interests and ignorance, but Brazilians who want to save the forest need all the help they can get.
19900608000000000	RAIN FORESTS DISAPPEARING 50% QUICKER THAN FEARED. Destruction of the world's tropical forests is occurring nearly 50% faster than the best previous scientific estimates showed, with enough trees being lost each year to cover the state of Washington, the World Resources Institute said Thursday. Between 40 million and 50 million acres are lost annually, according to new satellite measurements of vanishing timberland, with the biggest losses occurring in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Costa Rica. Earlier estimates by the United Nations and other organizations placed annual losses at 28 million acres. But these estimates were based on data gathered before 1980, compared to the latest findings, which are based on 1987 data. The earlier figures also were obtained largely through less accurate ground observations. Thursday's published report marked the first comprehensive picture of worldwide deforestation trends based on a compilation of recent studies. "We were startled, frankly," institute President James Gustave Speth said in a telephone interview from Washington. "We're looking at an environmental tragedy unfolding. It's much worse than had been previously suspected." The report, published in collaboration with the United Nations, has disturbing implications both for global warming and the extinction of plant and animal species, he said. Tropical forests are believed to not only shelter half of the world's plant and animal species -- most of them as yet undiscovered -- but serve as a major brake on the buildup of carbon dioxide, a principal contributor to global warming. Forests, most prominently in the Third World, are cut down at a rapid pace to provide wood for export and fuel, and to clear land for development and agriculture. When forests are cleared and burned, huge amounts of the carbon is returned to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide gas. Tree burning accounts for an estimated 30% of worldwide total carbon dioxide emissions. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline accounts for most of the rest. "If you combine increasing deforestation with the increasing use of fossil fuels in the industrial countries . . . it's easy to understand why the emissions of greenhouse gases have tripled over a 30-year period," Speth said. But he also cited reason for optimism, noting that in the last several years some nations, notably Brazil and India, have promised to curb the clearing of forests. A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington said it was too early to comment on the new estimates but that the institute's deforestation figures were based on "fairly reputable" studies. Ellen Tillier, public affairs officer with the World Bank in Washington, agreed. She said the higher deforestation rate was "along the lines" of recent estimates by the bank, which finances international development projects. Allen L. Hammond, editor of the volume, "World Resources, 1990-91," called the updated estimate released Thursday conservative. "In countries where we have reliable new data, its far worse than 50%. Fifty percent is a world average," he said. Hammond said most of the estimates were based on data collected by U.S. satellites and analyzed by scientists in the countries studied and by outside scientists. The data covers only half of the world's nations that have tropical forests. Additional studies are under way, including an update due in 1992 by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, whose study released in 1980 was the basis for the lower estimates called into question Thursday. Hammond said that when that information is made public, it will, "in fact, show even higher rates of deforestation than we're reporting." Brazil, which has the world's largest remaining tropical forests, also has the largest area of annual deforestation. The new studies indicate that Brazil's annual losses are between 10 and 20 million acres within the Amazon and 2.5 million acres outside the Amazon. In 1987, a peak year of deforestation in Brazil, the rate of loss was as much as 80% higher than earlier estimates for that country. During that year, Brazil caused 1.2 million tons of carbon to be released into the atmosphere, virtually the same amount pumped into the air by the much more industrialized United States from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline. Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing. Two days ago, President Fernando Collor de Mello announced that Brazil's armed forces were ready to help stop the burning and deforestation of the Amazon rain forest. But progress in Brazil is not expected to change the overall picture because deforestation in most other Third World countries appears to be increasing, the institute said. The World Resources Institute's report Thursday noted dramatic upswings in other countries' deforestation rates. In Myanmar, for example, 1.7 million acres are lost each year, "an astounding" 545% increase over 1980 estimates. The 1980 estimate relied on information collected in the mid-1970's and a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization computer model of rural population trends. The new estimate is based on recent field work, a continuing analysis of aerial photographs and satellite data and extrapolations from the U.N. data. In India, satellite sensing studies point to a 10-fold increase over previous estimates to 3.7 million acres a year. The Indonesian deforestation estimate of 2.2 million aces a year is 50% more than the 1980 estimate, and Costa Rica's figure rose 90% to 300,000 acres lost annually. Only in Thailand are the old and new estimates comparable. "The 1980s were a decade of devastation for the global environment. In the 1990s things could either get much, much worse or we could begin to start a healing. It all depends on what our governments are willing to do, more than anything else," Speth said. He called developments in Brazil encouraging. The report, published in collaboration with the U.N. Environment Program and the U.N. Development Program, also for the first time ranked greenhouse gas emissions from 146 countries. The United States and Soviet Union ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. Combined, they accounted for nearly 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide in 1987, followed by Brazil, China, India, Japan, West Germany and Great Britain. If the European Community is considered as a single entity, it would rank second behind the United States instead of the Soviet Union. Worldwide, the equivalent of 6.5 billion tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons were added to the atmosphere in 1987, the report said.

19900617000000000	CHICO MENDES: THE MAN WHO TRIED TO SAVE THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST; DEFORESTATION: STRUGGLING TO SAVE HOMES, LIVELIHOODS AND BRAZIL'S VAST RAIN FOREST, MENDES MADE A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR A LOT OF POWERFUL PEOPLE.. In the rain forest of the western Amazon, the threat of violent death hangs in the air like mist after a tropical rain. It is simply a part of the ecosystem, just like the scorpions and snakes cached in the leafy canopy that floats over the forest floor like a seamless green circus tent. People from the Amazon say that the trouble always starts during the burning season, a period of two months or so between the two natural climatic seasons of the region -- the dry and the wet. By then, the equatorial sun has baked the last moisture out of the brush, grass and felled trees, and the people of the Amazon -- sometimes Indians and rubber tappers, but most often wealthy ranchers and small farmers -- set their world on fire. The fires clear the clogged fields or freshly deforested land and, in disintegrating vegetation, put a few of the nutrients essential for plant growth back in the impoverished soil. The burning season is the time before the return of the daily downpours that give the rain forest its name. The trouble arises when one man's fires threaten another man's livelihood. Most often, that happens when one of the hundreds of ranchers or speculators who have been drawn to the region's cheap land acquires the title to property that already is the home of people who have squatted there legally -- sometimes for decades. Often the new titles are acquired through fraud or coercion. And because the most efficient way to reinforce a claim to land in the Amazon is to cut down the forest and burn it, the new landlords do just that. Or they loose their cattle, which make quick work of the settlers' crops. If that does not work, they send out their pistoleiros to burn the families out of their shacks or, if they resist, shoot them down. The only thing that has prevented the Amazon river basin and its peoples from being totally overrun is its sheer size and daunting character. It is a shallow bowl covering 3.6 million square miles, twice the expanse of India. An average of eight feet of rain falls here each year, inundating great stretches of forest, turning roads into bogs, and providing vast breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes. The water drains eastward through a fanlike network of streams and rivers that together disgorge 170 billion gallons of water each hour into the Atlantic -- eleven times the flow of the Mississippi. Besides producing this riverine sea, the deluge also nourishes the largest stretch of rain forest left on Earth. One of the tens of thousands of plant species in the forest is a tree with a smooth trunk that produces a white fluid in a reticulation of tubules beneath its bark. Its local name is seringueira; botanists call it Hevea brasiliensis. Its common name is the rubber tree. The fluid is thought to protect the tree from invasions of boring pests by gumming up the insects' mouth parts. This same fluid, congealed and properly processed, has remarkable qualities of resilience, water resistance and insulation to the flow of electricity -- all of which made it one of the most sought after raw materials of the Industrial Revolution. It was this substance, called latex, that lured the grandfather of Chico Mendes and tens of thousands of other men to the Amazon rain forest in two waves over the past 120 years. Called seringueiros, these men settled in the forests around ports like Xapuri and worked in solitude, fighting to make a life from the living forest -- and fighting to free themselves from bosses who saw to it that they remained enslaved by their debts. Recently, as outsiders intent on destroying the forest began to invade the Amazon, the seringueiros had to fight once again. This time, they were fighting to save their homes, their livelihood and the rain forest around them. In leading this struggle to preserve the Amazon, Chico Mendes had made a lot of trouble for a lot of powerful people. He was to the ranchers of the Amazon what Cesar Chavez was to the citrus kings of California, what Lech Walesa was to the shipyard managers of Gdansk. The Xapuri Rural Workers Union, which Mendes helped found in 1977, regularly sent swarms of demonstrators to thwart the ranchers' chain-saw crews. With his aggressive tactics and fable, plain-talking style, Mendes had then attracted the attention of American environmentalists, who invited him to Washington and Miami to help them convince the international development banks to suspend loans that were allowing Brazil to pave the roads leading into the Amazon. Mendes made friends abroad, but he made more enemies at home. The Amazon was one of the last places where might still made right. In that sense, it differed little from the American West of the 19th Century as described in 1872 by Mark Twain in "Roughing It": "The very paradise of outlaws and desperadoes." In the Amazon, when you ask people about justica (justice), they simply chuckle in a sad kind of way; most of the men in the prison cells are sleeping off a drunk, having had several too many slugs of the blazing, strong sugar-cane rum called cachaca, which is sold for pennies a glass. In fact, more than 1,000 people have been murdered in land disputes in rural Brazil since 1980, and Amnesty International estimates that fewer than 10 of the killers have been convicted and sent to jail. And not one mandante (mastermind) of a murder has ever been tried. In this anarchic atmosphere, the pistoleiros often assume the look of their imagined Wild West predecessors, strutting through town with a revolver stuck in the waist of tight jeans, boot heels raising red dust. Thus it was that in the latter half of December, the threats against Mendes had been replaced with death pronouncements. "Threat" implies that death is only a possibility; in Mendes' case, imminent death was a near inevitability. He was shot at close range with a .20 gauge shotgun when he stepped out his backdoor. The funeral of Mendes was held on Christmas Day. Through what the tappers call radio cipo -- vine radio, the rain forest version of the grapevine -- word of the murder spread quickly. Hundreds of rubber tappers hiked for many hours through the forest to attend the wake and funeral. By Christmas morning, more than a thousand people had crowded around the church. The rains had returned in force, drenching the mourners who followed the casket to the cemetery on the road leading out of town. Along with the hundreds of rubber tappers and small farmers in the procession were dozens of Mendes's friends from the other Brazil -- celebrities, politicians and labor leaders. Surrounding the crowd were dozens of journalists, many from overseas. An international version of vine radio had efficiently disseminated the news of the killing. The murder of Mendes might well have been an unremarkable event. He was the fifth rural union president murdered in Brazil that year, But over the previous three years, Mendes' closer relationships with environmentalists, labor organizers, and human-rights advocates from Brazil, the United States and Europe had focused increased attention on the struggle of the rubber tappers. As a result, this murder deep in the Amazon rain forest -- where it once took three weeks for news to travel down the river -- instantly became an international story, making the front page of newspapers around the world. The significance of his murder was further amplified by the disturbing environmental anomalies of 1988. The scorching summer in the United States that year had motivated politicians and the media for the first time to pay serious attention to the greenhouse effect, the theory that billions of tons of gases released each year by the burning of fossil fuels and forests are trapping solar energy in the atmosphere and disastrously warming the planet. And just as the heat was breaking records and fires were ravaging Yellowstone National Park, the television networks got detailed satellite photographs of the Amazon burning season -- thousands of fires burning simultaneously. It almost felt as if the heat and smoke generated in the forests were being inhaled on the baking streets of Los Angeles, Washington and New York. Then came the slaying of Mendes. In the months that followed, dozens of television crews, photographers and reporters from around the world would take the six-hour, four-stop flight from Sao Paulo to Rio Branco, the capital of the state of Acre, then bounce for four more hours along the rutted, dusty, partly paved road to Xapuri, the river town where Mendes lived. Visitors who stayed long enough to walk for a time in the surrounding forest discovered the bounty of the ecosystem that Mendes had died defending. It was a place of spectacular diversity and vitality. Turn over a log and find 50 species of beetle. Survey an acre and find 100 species of butterfly. In the Amazon, one type of rubber tree has exploding fruit that flings seeds 20 yards; three-toed sloths harbor dozens of species of insects and algae in their matted fur; river porpoises are cotton-candy pink. It was a living pharmacy that scientists had only just begun to explore. A fourth of all prescription drugs contain ingredients derived from tropical plants -- malaria drugs and anesthetics and antibiotics and more -- and less than 1% of the Amazon's plants had been studied. It became clear to outsiders that the murder was a microcosm of the larger crime: the unbridled destruction of the last great reservoir of biological diversity on Earth. Just a few centuries ago, the planet had 15 million square miles of rain forest, an area five times that of the contiguous United States. Now three Americas' worth of forest were gone, with just 6.2 million square miles left. One-third of the remaining rain forest was in the Amazon basin, and over the past decade alone, chain saws and fires had consumed about 10% of it, an area twice the size of California. The aggression against the forest was therefore a many-layered tragedy, causing human deaths, killing millions of trees and other organisms and resulting in the extinction of several species of plant and animal life each day -- most of which had not even been noticed, let alone catalogued or studied. In some ways, Mendes and the rubber tappers were simply another endangered species, as much a part of the ecosystem as the trees they tapped, the birds in the branches, or the ants underfoot. But the tappers were a species that was fighting back.
19901023000000000	ENVIRONMENT ; IN THE AMAZON, FOREST AND FARMERS HAVE TO GET ALONG; TO SAVE BRAZIL'S TROPICAL WILDERNESS, EXPERTS SAY, ALTERNATIVES ARE NEEDED TO DESTRUCTIVE FARMING METHODS. THEY BELIEVE THE REGION CAN BE PROFITABLE AND PRESERVED.. The sprawling, air-conditioned hotel at the edge of the Amazon forest teemed with ideas for saving the world's biggest tropical wilderness. It was a flourishing ecosystem of ideas, with the exuberance of a triple-canopy jungle, some ideas like towering trees, others like dense undergrowth and entwining vines. They sprouted from the mouths of conservationists, researchers, government technicians and officials; they blossomed from photocopied treatises, slide projectors and posters; they germinated on note pads and paper napkins. The lush proliferation of ideas left no doubt that an international conference called "Forest 90" was a fertile theoretical environment. A sampling: Dirigibles will float over the wilderness, lowering in loggers to cut mature hardwood trees with as little damage to the forest as possible. New trees will be planted to replace the harvested ones, which will be hoisted into the sky and carried to nearby rivers, then floated to distant sawmills. No more logging roads slicing destructively through the fragile flora and fauna. Forest dwellers will not only tap rubber and gather Brazil nuts, as they do today, but also will collect foods, medicinal plants, gums, fibers, dyes, oils and other products for marketing in Brazil and abroad. Useful species will be reseeded. In riverside settlements, processing plants and cottage industries will turn forest products into finished goods, providing needed jobs. Agricultural extension workers will help farmers cultivate combinations of trees that yield profitable crops on small plots, protecting the land from the erosion and hardening that can occur when the forest is removed. This sustained "agroforestry" will render unnecessary the slash-and-burn farming methods that have already destroyed so much native forest. Landowners will raise big, fast-growing Amazon fish in ponds covering a few acres, earning much more than they could by raising cattle on large tracts of cleared land. Waste from chicken coops at the edge of the water will feed the fish. Two million Amazon colonos, pioneer farmers from other parts of Brazil, have shown how the imperative of economic survival can devour virgin forest. Most colonos begin by planting traditional subsistence crops such as beans, corn and an abundant root crop called manioc on cleared forest land. When the soil wears out in two or three years, they clear more land. More rain forest disappears. Saving the forest, it was clear here, is not only a matter of curbing rapacious ranchers, but also of offering small farmers economic alternatives to destructive methods. Like the vast rain forest itself, the ideas for weaning farmers from the slash-and-burn cycle seemed to have no end. Plant manioc in combination with nitrogen-fixing legumes that will replenish and protect weak soils. Exploit unwooded river flood plains with intensive cultivation of rice or super-grasses to feed livestock. Grow shade-seeking perennial crops, such as pepper and cacao, under otherwise useless secondary forest growth, capoeira, on the deforested land. Develop more productive agroforestry "consortiums" of different crop trees that thrive together. The goal is to "fix the man on the land" with a sustainable system of production. "For every year this person doesn't have to move, it means 'X' number of acres that aren't cleared," said John Butler, a consultant with the World Wildlife Fund. But Forest 90's 1,200 participants -- environmentalists and government officials -- well knew that as deforestation chews away at Brazil's Amazon region, ideas alone will not save the unmatched diversity of its myriad plants and animals. While the impressive flood of ideas offered hope for the Amazon, it also underlined a difficult challenge: A monumental effort is needed to sort out the various forest-saving possibilities and to put them into widespread practice. To accomplish the goal, new techniques must be taught, and other assistance delivered, to a rural population of 5 million in an area nearly three times as large as Alaska. That could require an army of agricultural extension agents. Currently, few results of Amazon agricultural research reach farmers in the field. Luiz Carlos Molion, a Brazilian climatologist and forest hydrologist, served himself a few chunks of river fish from the hotel's luncheon buffet. "This is tambaqui, but it's undersized," said Molion, 43, a stout man with a ruddy face and scraggly russet beard. "They're taking small fish from the rivers because the big ones are being fished out." Demand for tambaqui and other Amazon fish is high: A kilogram of tambaqui costs more than a kilogram of beef in Manaus, a city of more than a million people. Molion and others who know the Amazon say fish-raising in ponds could become a major source of food and income for the region's people, with a low ecological cost. But so far, little has been done to implement the idea. Leonir Naumann is an exception rather than the rule. He operates a farm near the village of Bela Vista, 40 miles west of Manaus on the Upper Amazon River. And on his farm he has a fishpond, full of maturing tambaqui, tucunare and pirarucu. Naumann, 33, walked along the shore and pointed to fish breaking the pond's surface. He said he soon will take his first catch to market and his farm will begin to turn a profit for the first time in the 10 years he has owned it. He also has 135 head of dairy cattle, but he said poor Amazon soil makes pasture maintenance too expensive to be profitable. He wore sandals and blue shorts, and his tanned shoulders shone like copper under the midday sun as he stopped to make a simple calculation: Each cow requires 2.5 acres of grazing land, but 2.5 acres of fishpond will produce more than 150,000 pounds of tambaqui in three years. He feeds the fish dried cow manure and manioc -- a crop he also fertilizes with manure. About 740 acres of forest has been cleared from Naumann's 4,300 acres of land, and he said he will cut no more. "I am against deforestation," he said. "There is a lot of deforested land and it isn't being used." More than 100,000 square miles of Brazil's Amazon forest has been razed for pasture, an area larger than Oregon. An estimated two-thirds of that has degenerated into brush and the secondary forest growth, capoeira. Agroforestry has proved to be one of the most productive uses of cleared Amazon land. Over the years, Sebastiao Silva Martins, 65, has planted a small jungle on his plot outside Bela Vista. His trees produce rubber, cacao, oranges, passion fruit, mangoes, palm peaches and cupuacu. Some thrive in the shade; others grow high, seeking sunshine. The trees protect the fragile soil from hardening and erosion. They produce year after year. The tree farm doesn't require much work, and Martins doesn't have to spend money on such things as fertilizer. "The fertilizer is just the leaves," he said. Like Naumann, Martins gets no help from agricultural extension workers or ecologists. He has learned which combinations of trees work best from talking with his neighbors and experimenting. In his small way, he has demonstrated that farming in the Amazon need not destroy the forest. The biggest controversy at the conference was about "extractive reserves" -- forest areas set aside for residents to exploit without destroying them. The government has created four extractive reserves with a total of 5.4 million acres and others are being planned. But debate goes on over whether they will be economically sustainable in the long run. Critics said prices for forest products such as natural latex, nuts and herbs cannot adequately compensate for the time it takes to gather them. They contended that when demand increases for a forest product, it will be depleted -- or domesticated for more economical production on farms. Defenders of the concept argued that markets for new products must be developed. They predicted that the forest's hundreds of thousands of plant species, many of them yet to be studied, will be a cornucopia of marketable new material. And they said forest areas can be "enriched" by planting. Americans interested in rain-forest conservation already have begun buying ice cream and other products made with Amazon ingredients. Some conference participants envisioned a boom in demand for "rain-forest chic" products. "Either we find ways to preserve the forest and improve the lives of the people there, or 20 or 30 years from now there won't be any more researchers researching the forest, because there won't be any forest," said Julio Barbosa, a rubber-tappers union leader. Environmentalists and government officials at Forest 90 agreed that the Amazon should be zoned for forest preservation and controlled development. Jose Goldemberg, the national secretary of science and technology, said a regional zoning plan is being prepared and will be finished by 1992. Alcir Meira, superintendent of the official Amazon development agency, said the agency is drafting its sixth plan for the region. The agency, known by the acronym SUDAM, dedicated much of its efforts in the past to fostering big cattle ranching projects in the Amazon, granting tax concessions and other incentives. But Meira said the new plan will emphasize ecological balance. "What it will not permit anymore is to give incentives for cutting down forest for ranching," he said in an interview. Molion, the forest hydrologist, is creating a new Amazon agency called Unitrop that will distribute donated funds for research on ecologically compatible development and for extension work. He said one of the first projects to be sponsored by Unitrop will distribute minnows and teach farmers to operate commercial fishponds. "You don't need to cut the forest to plant and harvest it," he said. That, in essence, is the gospel according to Forest 90. The future of the Amazon may rest largely on whether its message is heard.
19891214000000000	COLUMN ONE; PROBLEMS FLOW INTO AMAZON; WHILE WORLD CONCERN FOCUSES ON BRAZIL, THE HEADWATER AREAS OF THE ANDES FACE EVEN MORE THREATENING DEVASTATION.. Like the waters cascading from the Andes Mountains, problems and hopes are pouring downstream into the Amazon jungle basin from the highlands that give life to the world's mightiest river. All along an immense crescent from Venezuela through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, covering a distance of more than 3,000 miles, the Amazon finds its strength. Nearly one-third of the Amazon Basin lies in the rim of Latin American countries surrounding Brazil. While world concern homes in on Brazil's struggles over the development and conservation of its rain forests, the countries whose waters feed the river are attempting, more quietly, to cope with equally daunting dilemmas. Indeed, in several ways the array of problems facing the headwaters of the Amazon is more complex, and more threatening, than in Brazil itself. While the Brazilian settler's trek westward from the Atlantic can mean a 2,000-mile journey, the reverse migration from the Pacific side of the continent rarely is longer than a few hundred miles. With limited open space and exploding populations, these poor, indebted nations see their Amazon interior as an escape valve and a potential economic salvation. But the Andes plunge down into jungle so suddenly -- with elevation changes of 12,000 feet or more within a few dozen miles -- that problems like erosion and river-silting from deforestation take on frightening proportions. Conversations with dozens of officials, scientists and residents in the region underscore a web of crises at the headwaters: The rush to develop oil reserves has opened up hundreds of miles of roads, bringing a crush of settlers and land speculation; illegal coca fields on steep hillside jungles in Peru and Bolivia feed erosion, and cocaine processing pollutes rivers with tons of illegal chemicals; restive native Indians are chafing over relentless encroachment, and deforestation is proceeding at a dizzying pace. The conflicts result in part from the delicate landscape in the countries where the Amazon is born. Tiny highland brooks form the river's most tender veins. The headwaters then plummet down jagged canyons through fragile cloud forests that are among the world's wettest climates and richest ecosystems. The waters already have swelled into powerful rivers by the time they descend from the eastern Andes slopes into tropical rain forest -- as much as 1,000 miles before joining the Amazon's main artery in the relatively flat jungle across the border in Brazil. The mountains feed the rivers a rich diet of minerals, which leach into the soils downstream on the lowland river banks during flooding. That makes the land relatively attractive for farmer-settlers, in contrast to the often poorer jungle soils in Brazil. The geography also has left deposits of oil, gold and other riches in the jungles at the foot of the mountains -- all magnets for development. With a hodgepodge of sometimes conflicting and often ill-enforced policies in hand, governments surrounding Brazil are attempting to control the rapid colonization and exploitation of their Amazon regions. At the same time, their awareness of ecological hazards is haltingly taking hold. Environmentalists, a growing force in these countries, are waving danger flags. They are also moderating their anti-development stance into a more realistic approach of sensible, controlled development. "The crises in the economy and the environment are closely linked here, and people are beginning to realize it," said Antonio Brack Egg, a leading Peruvian ecologist. "We have abused, looted our resources to a terrible degree. We have cleared 8.5 million hectares (21 million acres) of the Amazon in Peru, and 6 million hectares are abandoned. We must make that land productive instead of clearing more. What we desperately lack is planning." Peru and Ecuador face the gravest threats. Peru has 16% of the basin, the largest outside Brazil, and the basin makes up 60% of Peru's territory. Roughly 10% of the 300,000 square miles of the Peruvian basin has been cleared of forest. Ecuador, though far smaller than Peru and containing just 2% of the basin, confronts a comparatively greater array of pressures, in part because its population density and growth rate are the highest in the region. In search of space and a future, its people eye the vast expanse of green below the mountains. Only about half of the Ecuadorean basin remains forested. Road Was Lacking Five years ago, there was no road along the south bank of the Napo River, one of Ecuador's major Amazon tributaries. Jungle native families of the Huarani and the Quijos Quichua tribes hunted and farmed a few acres, and colonists -- usually poor Indians themselves from the Andes highlands -- pushed downriver from Puerto Napo, their progress slowed by the lack of transport other than outboard-powered dugout canoes. When the 25-mile dirt road was opened from Puerto Napo to Ahuano, hundreds more settlers followed. They were ceded 125-acre tracts by the colonization program. The Huarani fled to the interior, and the Quijos Quichua quickly sought to legalize their traditional holdings, with mixed success. The result is a sudden patchwork of bare-bone farms, reached by lumbering buses that come three times a day. Loggers are felling 2-foot-diameter hardwood trees. Thousands of acres of virgin rain forest have disappeared. Francisco Tapuy, a native who runs the 50-pupil primary school in the newly constituted village of Atahualpa, said, "The colonists have brought more advanced agricultural techniques, which is positive, but they also teach us crime, social conflict. They exploit, they take the land by force, they don't pay. The natives know how to exist on the land without destroying it." He said the 300 families, mostly natives, carefully chose the name for their town: Atahualpa was the 17th-Century Inca leader who resisted capture by the Spanish colonists in Peru. "There is no room here for more colonists," Tapuy said. "We are already seeing some erosion." He pointed to a bare patch on a cleared hillside where a landslide had occurred. "Civilization is arriving," he said. Many Got Land Titles Between 1964 and 1982, 12,838 settlers and 4,343 natives received land titles in the Ecuadorean Amazon. Many more applications, which usually take years to process, are in the works. A major source of anger for the natives, and for conservationists and planners in Quito, the capital, is the principle that underlies the development program. The law once required settlers to clear 80% of their land in two years to win ownership. The rule has been eased, but the concept still prevails in practice. Thus, the natives who use the forest without cutting it down are penalized, while settlers who arrive and clear land for farming are awarded title more easily. Further encouraging deforestation is the timber-harvesting policy, which determines royalties on the amount of wood actually cut, rather than the harvestable volume on a given tract. Both the land title and timber policies "have had a devastating impact on tropical forests in the provinces of northwest and Amazonian Ecuador," said a study conducted for the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). Although environmental laws are numerous, "the problem in Ecuador is an inconsistent and uncoordinated application. . . . The result is a myriad of legal conflicts brought on by conflicting jurisdictions, ill-defined policies, unclear objectives and the failure to systematically apply even the best of environmental laws." Flavio Coello of the forestry protection program in the Agriculture Ministry said land speculators buy up tracts, sell the logging rights and report figures far below what they actually cut. "For lack of a clear political policy, we haven't been able to stop it," he said. "The ownership of land in this country is in chaos." Coello has just four park guards to protect the entire Yasuni National Park, which covers 2.5 million acres in the Amazon basin. "To try to enforce control there would be like trying to empty the sea," he said. Coello said colonization has already begun along the edges of Yasuni, but he added: "We can't blame the colonists with their 50 hectares. The fault lies with the government and its failure to impose order. It's as if they are in a trance." Ecuador's Amazon boom coincided with the discovery and exploitation of major oil reserves in the early 1970s, and few people suggest that an impoverished country can or should ignore such a vital source of income, even in national parks. Coello, however, expressed anger at the government oil company and several foreign firms, including Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum, whose exploration block includes a corner of Yasuni Park. He said the firms have refused requests to provide minimal assistance to pay for guards and research that would prevent oil exploration from leading to deforestation. In contrast, he said, Conoco has agreed to provide substantial aid after suffering international criticism for its planned road into Yasuni for oil production. David Neill of the Missouri Botanical Garden, who has worked in Ecuador's jungles for four years, said that Conoco, Union Oil of California and Petro Canada all are supporting scientific research during their oil exploration, but others have not come forward to help. Fernando Ortiz, an ecologist who advises AID, estimated that about 300 miles of roads have been built since the early 1970s, mostly for jungle oil production, "without consideration of Indian interests, the environment, anything." Roads are far easier to build in jungle areas nearer the Andes than Brazil because the rivers bring down gravel deposits needed to keep the roads from becoming impassable. Farther downstream, gravel is unavailable, and it must be hauled in for road-building at high cost. So road development and colonization have been easier near the headwaters of the Amazon. Deforestation is occurring in Ecuador at a rate of 2.3% a year, costing up to 850,000 acres a year, including 187,500 acres of virgin forest, according to the study done for AID. For those charged with development in the region, however, roads are the solution. Asked to name the No. 1 priority for the Napo River area, land title office secretary Juan Leonardo Mera said: "Highways. This is the fundamental basis of growth. With roads, the people work harder, plant more yuca, coffee, and the costs drop because they can take out their products." The land title office, one of six in the Amazon, approves about 200 new titles a year. Of the total 1.43 million acres in its area, the office has carved up 834,000 for development, while 307,000 acres are set aside as protected zones. Ivan Romo, an Agriculture Ministry land analyst, said the timber industry, not the small colonist, is the real villain in deforestation. "They can clear 50 acres in two months, and they have no programs of forestation. Then the destruction starts, the soil weakens and erosion sets in." Romo's department recently began a program to provide residents with seedlings to reforest fields. Army Takes Role Hugo Ramiro Landazuri, governor of Napo province, said the government is using the army at checkpoints to control colonization, stop land speculation and reduce frictions between natives and settlers. The Napo region, with a total population approaching 300,000, has grown so fast that it was split into two provinces this year: Napo itself, with the capital at Tena, and Sucumbios to the north, with the capital in the oil town of Lago Agrio. The governor said he opposes further colonization, preferring to focus on better use of the land already cleared. "We also have hydroelectric potential (and) we have marble and gold. These can be developed carefully. "The natives believe that the whites and mestizos (mixed-race people) are invading and taking their land," he said. "But it is also necessary that the poor Ecuadoreans from the highlands have a chance to thrive. We are a small country, and we need to grow." For the natives, such talk merely suggests further encroachment. Ruben Calapucha, a 28-year-old leader of the provincial Indian federation representing about 25,000 natives in the Napo area, reminded a visitor: "The land is our culture, our essence, our history, our survival." The native group is less concerned about colonists than the land agency and large companies. "We say that if a foreign company comes in and takes away our riches, then we at least want those companies to meet the many needs of these communities -- putting up schools, community centers, health clinics. We want the government to make these things part of the contract, Calapucha said." Even the save-the-Amazon movement has indirectly hurt the natives, Calapucha said. "They say this is the lung of the world, so they have created reserves where they won't give us titles. But we have been here for generations!" The population in the Amazon areas of Peru and Ecuador has surged at nearly double the national rate in the last 15 years, with the greatest growth right at the foot of the Andes and on the slopes of the mountains. That growth, and the discovery of oil in the late 1960s in both countries, nourished the off-and-on dream of conquering the jungle. One of the primary architects of the dream was former Peruvian President Fernando Belaunde Terry, who envisioned a highway, never built, through the western Amazon from Colombia to Paraguay. The concept reflected the importance of the Amazon to the countries whose mountains create it. Much of Belaunde's road would have passed through highland jungle and cloud forest on the slopes of the Andes. One portion of the road was built, through Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, with disastrous consequences. During a recent flight over the valley in a police helicopter, a visitor saw hundreds of plumes of smoke rising from the floor and precipices as farmers cleared new fields. If the past pattern holds, much of the space will be devoted to coca fields. The Upper Huallaga is the largest single source of the leaf used to make cocaine. Estimates of coca plantations there range as high as 450,000 acres, by far the largest crop in the Peruvian Amazon. Because it is illegal, although largely unmolested, coca is grown on the least suitable terrain, according to Marc J. Dourojeanni, a professor at the National Agrarian University in Lima. Bolivia, which contains about 12% of the Amazon basin, is the No. 2 coca producer after Peru, with much of its uplands jungle similarly affected. Colombia is a far smaller coca grower and under less jungle settlement pressure, but it has major cocaine-refining operations. Dourojeanni said in a report that coca fields alone may have caused 10% of Peru's deforestation in the Amazon in this century. "Ecologically, coca is located in some of the most fragile life zones of the country, some of which are the least apt for agriculture," he wrote. Coca is grown between 2,000 and 6,500 feet on unterraced hills, extremely susceptible to erosion. Some erosion is gradual, with up to 300 metric tons of soil washed away each year per 2.5 acres. Some is catastrophic. Fatal Landslides Deadly landslides kill dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of people each year in Peru's valleys, often blocking roads for days. Coca growers use herbicides that wash into rivers, but far worse is the discharge of chemicals used in the refining process -- as much as 57 million liters of kerosene and 32 million liters of sulfuric acid per year in Peru. Two national forests and several parks have been partially invaded by coca. Dourojeanni noted that coca is being adapted to grow at lower altitudes, and new road construction could "disperse the coca growers through the entire Amazon region," just as the construction of the Jungle Highway in the Upper Huallaga by Belaunde brought coca to that area. As in Ecuador, Peruvian environmentalists blame conflicting policies and lack of government control. And many insist that the consequences of problems at the origins of the Amazon threaten its entire course to the Atlantic. "People are always harping about the lowland jungle and Brazil, but the cloud forests are twice as important," said Tony Luscombe, an American ecologist who has lived in Peru for years. "When you take off the trees, you start the erosion, which causes flash floods and clogs the rivers. Things are happening here with a vengeance, and nobody's raising a voice." Luscombe said oil companies are already having trouble moving materials by barge in some areas because silting from erosion had reduced river depths. "The government is giving incentives to get people roaring off into the jungle to avoid having to solve the problems in the sierra (mountains), where they originate," he said. Jorge Caillaux Zazzali, president of the Peruvian Society of Environmental Law, complained that the Amazon Treaty signed by countries in the region has merely become a device to fight off industrialized countries who oppose Amazon destruction. He said the treaty needs teeth imposing obligations on each member and "forming the basis for planned and balanced development." If Peru pollutes upstream and thus hurts Brazil, the Brazilian government should be empowered under the treaty to force a response, he said. Gustavo Suarez, technical director of Peru's Foundation for the Conservation of Nature, said that while Peru has taken steps to protect its forests through a national plan for sustained use, a contradictory law was passed in January pushing colonization and industrial development of the lowland jungle. Once again, Suarez said, the government has ignored the repeatedly demonstrated fact that the paltry soils are unsuitable for cattle ranching and monoculture, or single-crop farming. With the new policy, "it is very probable that new areas will be opened for the cultivation of coca and drug-trafficking, especially after the colonists encounter impoverished soils and cannot sustain themselves any other way." More recently, to the relief of the environmental lobby, the government has set up a commission, including non-government and native groups, to draft a broader strategy for Amazon development. In the far southeastern corner of Peru, the Madre de Dios River region contains some of the richest and most diverse virgin rain forests of the Amazon. In the first expanse of flat jungle after the mountains and hills have subsided, immense trees form a canopy so thick that no photographs can be taken in the constant dusk below. Tree roots branch out like flukes 30 feet from the trunks of the largest trees. Native people know how to drink water from tree fruit and use wood chips as insect repellent. On the grounds of the riverside Cuzco Amazonico Lodge, an estimated 120 mammals roam, and one visiting scientist counted eight species of bats. Jose Dominguez, the lodge manager for the last 10 years, said growing eco-tourism has helped encourage protection of the Amazon by generating badly needed foreign income. But he worries about settlers who are pushing up against his borders. And he worries about the gold dredgers now appearing on the river. "Maybe I won't be alive, but someday. . . . " Dominguez trailed off, leaving unspoken his fears for the future.
19891214000000000	DEBT SWAPPING FURTHERS CONSERVATION CAUSE IN FORESTS OF ECUADOR, COSTA RICA AND BOLIVIA. Latin America's huge foreign debt, a crushing burden in every country, has brought a Midas-like windfall for nature conservation in three small nations seeking to protect their tropical rain forests. Ecuador, Costa Rica and Bolivia have swapped tiny portions of their debts for foreign investment in environmental projects, most of them aimed at saving the region's jungle areas. In each case, the hard cash donated from abroad has had an impact far out of proportion to the initial investment, thanks to the multiplier effect of such swaps. The concept has some built-in dangers for the debtor countries, principally the risk of fueling inflation and jeopardizing broader debt renegotiations, so the programs are unlikely to reach a major scale. Still, they are already funding some substantial environmental projects. Ecuador, which has signed swaps worth $10 million in debt, and Costa Rica, at $11 million, are by far the biggest nature dealers. Bolivia's program is far smaller, at $650,000, but it has funded a major expansion of the Beni Biosphere Reserve, an important flood plain for the Amazon basin. The swaps involve a minuscule fraction of Latin America's $400-billion-plus total debt. In February, 1988, Costa Rica arranged donations from a range of international environmental groups for an initial $547,000 to buy $3.3 million in debt, reflecting the market's discount value of the debt. Further programs have followed, and more are planned. The interest from the bonds purchased with the funds is being used to protect Costa Rica's natural parks, which include tracts of Central American rain forest. Ecuador's Nature Foundation, an influential non-governmental organization, has coordinated the effort here. The first swap, involving the purchase of $1 million of debt, took place in March, 1988, and a second package worth $9 million more was completed this year, with "investments" by the World Wildlife Fund and Nature Conservancy. Cash donations of well under $2 million bought the whole $10 million worth of debt because of the discount offered by banks eager to unload unpaid debt. The bonds purchased pay interest twice a year, and with Ecuadorean rates at 36% annually, the return will be substantial. The income next year will fund programs including a ecological data bank; protection of national parks, including the Galapagos Islands, Amazonian areas and endangered cloud forests on the slopes of the Andes, and training and education programs. "This covers our needs for protected areas for the next eight to 10 years," said Gonzalo Oviedo, who handles debt swaps for the Nature Foundation. "But in my opinion, at least for the foundation, the debt-swap chapter is already practically closed." Oviedo said the government is concerned about the inflationary impact of such swaps because they increase the amount of local currency in circulation. The dollars never actually reach Ecuador; foreign donors pay foreign banks that hold the debt, and the Ecuadorean government then issues matching bonds in local currency -- a form of printing money. Another risk is political: By accepting the notion of such swaps, the government may prejudice its ability to renegotiate its foreign debt on favorable terms. Oviedo said that swapping debt is an acknowledgment that it should be paid in the first place. Furthermore, to pay their debts, poor nations often are forced to adopt export-oriented policies that produce severe environmental damage, Oviedo argued. Deforestation, for example, can result from logging, agriculture and oil exploration fueled by the need to generate export earnings, he said. "The Nature Foundation believes it is absurd to pay the debt," Oviedo said. "I believe that in a few years, there will not even be any point in negotiating on the debt, and swaps will become meaningless. But in the meantime, we might as well seek ways to generate resources for nature conservation."
19901218000000000	A SIGN OF HOPE FOR BRAZIL'S MASSES; A VERDICT REFOCUSES ATTENTION ON THE 2-MILLION-SQUARE-MILE AMAZON RAIN FOREST. The conviction of two Brazilian ranchers on charges they plotted and carried out the murder of environmentalist Chico Mendes is not simply a vindication of the late union leader's life and work. It also is a sign of hope to Brazil's struggling masses and a challenge to those foreigners who have embraced Mendes' goal of preserving the 2-million-square-mile Amazon rain forest, the world's largest remaining tropical woodland. The killers were cattle ranchers whose plans to expand their holdings by burning forest lands were thwarted by the activities of the rubber-tappers' union Mendes founded. Rubber tappers live by extracting latex and gathering nuts. Since 1980, more than 1,000 members of unions and other peasant associations have been murdered in disputes with Brazilian landowners. Only twice before have the killers been convicted of their crimes. Human-rights workers hope the decision signals a break with Brazil's long history of judicial indifference to such outrages. The international outcry that followed Mendes' murder already has helped induce the Brazilian government to abolish the tax credits that made it profitable to convert rain forests to pastureland. It also has established a 2.4-million-acre "extractive" reserve in Mendes' memory, where 3,000 families earn their livelihood through the traditional gathering of latex and nuts. It remains to be discovered, however, whether Chico Mendes' many vocal admirers in the industrialized world were attracted by his values or his brief celebrity. This year alone, three books have been published on his life; a film biography is about to go into production. But long after those books have sunk to the bottom of dusty remainder piles and the movie has been relegated to the insomniac wasteland of late-night cable, Brazil still will be struggling to reconcile the needs of 150 million desperately deprived people with its obligation to be the responsible steward of an irreplaceable natural resource.
