VW chief says Lopez made first approach.
MR JOSE Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua General Motors former global purchasing chief first approached arch rival Volkswagen before Christmas last year according to Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman.
I did not try to woo him Mr Piech said yesterday in an interview with the Financial Times.
Mr Lopez currently at the centre of a storm over alleged industrial espionage eventually quit GM and joined VW in mid March.
We got to know each other and discovered we thought in similar ways Mr Piech said.
Mr Lopez s move had nothing to do with money Mr Piech said.
The timing and the nature of the contacts between the two men around six months after Mr Lopez was promoted to the top ranks of GM in the US puts paid to speculation that he was lured away by Mr Piech.
It suggests that Mr Lopez was planning his defection over an extended period.
He was followed by seven former colleagues who are due to appear in court in Frankfurt today to challenge a legal attempt by GM to prevent them from continuing to work for VW for up to one year.
The court case is one of several launched by GM and Adam Opel its German subsidiary based on their belief that Mr Lopez and his team took secret GM documents with them when they left Detroit.
Mr Piech disclosed yesterday that VW had already successfully fought several legal skirmishes with GM.
We have four rounds behind us and VW has made no mistakes.
The VW chairman who on Monday broke his recent silence with a statement supporting Mr Lopez said any possible legal charges would be answered in court.
Mr Piech dismissed suggestions that VW s actions in hiring away Mr Lopez and his seven colleagues from GM had caused widespread dismay in German industry and was at odds with the style of German business.
Court rejects GM case against former staff.
GENERAL Motors the world s leading volume carmaker yesterday suffered its first important loss in the legal battle against Germany s Volkswagen.
An initial bid to prevent seven former employees of GM and Adam Opel the US group s German subsidiary from working for Volkswagen for 12 months was thrown out by a Frankfurt court.
Meanwhile a public prosecutor examining GM s complaints of industrial espionage against a top VW executive said preliminary investigations could last at least six months.
This followed a statement that enough information had already been gathered to justify an initial probe.
The US concern had been asked to provide further documents to back its most serious claim against VW.
that its former global buying chief Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others had taken secret documents and industrial information with him when he defected to VW in March.
Opel said later the case against the seven more junior VW employees would continue.
Yesterday s rejection at an oral hearing of Opel s application for an urgent temporary injunction would be followed by a full hearing he added.
We had expected this verdict Dr Lopez said.
Every person has the right to choose where he works.
The decision was the first significant setback for Opel which recently won an injunction barring VW from continuing systematically to poach its personnel.
According to Opel Mr Lopez and his colleagues had approached around 40 senior buying and production staff.
According to a VW official the company had chosen not to challenge this injunction to avoid further legal conflict and because the charge was not valid either in the past or now.
The seven involved in yesterday s case which did not involve Mr Lopez include former top members of Mr Lopez s buying team at GM who left the US shortly after their boss.
Most notable is Mr Jose Gutierrez GM s former machinery and equipment procurement chief and now head of purchasing for the VW brand division.
The delays caused by the long investigation into the charges against Mr Lopez and the rejection of the call for the injunction will bring widespread relief to VW.
They will allow its new employees to press ahead with the urgent overhaul of the purchasing and manufacturing processes.
Ferdinand Piech chairman of the Volkswagen management board speaks to Kevin Done.
Ferdinand Piech has learnt how to smile for much of the time but under pressure his piercing blue eyes turn icy cold.
His technique for ending discussion of items that do not please is singularly effective.
The chairman of the Volkswagen management board makes his point turns on the stare and falls silent.
On the subject for example of his new effective number two Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua who faces allegations of industrial espionage from former employer General Motors he says.
We have said quite clearly that allegations that come from the state prosecutor are to be dealt with in accordance with German law before the courts and not not through the mass media.
Piech has a reputation for not giving up for getting exactly what he wants.
Running Audi the Volkswagen group s executive car division for four years was not enough for him.
He wanted to become chief executive of the group Europe s biggest carmaker which includes Seat and Skoda alongside VW and Audi.
For a long time the Vienna born Piech an automotive engineer and a scion of the Porsche family was seen as only an outside candidate to succeed the urbane and worldly Carl Hahn who had led VW for a decade.
But in January it was Piech who took over his reputation for ruthless restructuring preferred to the engaging philosophising of Daniel Goeudevert currently VW deputy chairman.
Piech wanted Lopez General Motors global head of purchasing at his side.
He hoped Lopez the man who acquired an almost legendary reputation for cutting GM s purchasing costs would help him push through a revolution in the sclerotic Volkswagen bureaucracy.
GM tried desperately to hold on to the services of the mercurial Basque but Piech was not to be denied.
Then he re signed for GM apparently brought back into the fold by an offer from Jack Smith GM chief executive to take control of the entire North American operations of the world s biggest vehicle maker.
Lopez prepared a statement explaining why he was staying at GM.
I am very happy to be here today at General Motors the company I love.
A couple of hours before the scheduled GM press conference Lopez was on his way to Wolfsburg VW s headquarters.
As Piech tells it the move had been planned for several months.
The first meeting took place before Christmas and it was a meeting of minds.
It s about maintaining Europe as a centre for manufacturing industry to defend it and to make it number one in the world again.
For that you need a combination of skills someone that comes out of the production discipline that is him and someone who comes from engineering and development and its capacity for making quantum leaps and that s me.
With this combination we are in the position to make quantum leaps both in the development of new products and in cutting costs.
This team only exists in one place in the world.
Piech s determination to bring Lopez to VW proved irresistible but at a cost.
Volkswagen has been pitched into a storm of retaliatory legal action from General Motors which is diverting VW top management s attention from the central issue of rescuing their company from its uncomfortable postion as probably the highest cost volume carmaker in Europe.
In the final quarter of last year the VW group suffered a loss of DM563m (Pounds 229m).
In the first quarter of this year it followed up with a loss of DM1.
As the former head of the Audi division who crucially did not have a position on the VW group executive management board Piech blames the company s fall into loss firmly on the old management mentioning the onset of recession only in passing.
The VW group s current difficulties can only be blamed in small part on the weakness of new car sales and the same is true for other German manufacturers.
The real cause is much more the structural problems of the entire sector which are now being openly exposed by the recession.
We have to accept that in the eight years of booming sales we did not do our homework.
Our task for the coming years is to come to grips with this structural transformation.
He has started by cutting a large part of the old VW management including the former finance and production directors.
The former head of research and development has been demoted to the divisional board for the VW brand.
the former human resources director is now responsible for Asia Pacific.
Many other senior managers just below the executive board have been replaced.
The restructuring measures announced so far include job cuts fierce pruning of capital investments and pressure put on components suppliers to cut costs and prices.
More economical production methods are being introduced more parts are to be made common across model ranges.
The VW group does not need 12 different designs of cigarette lighters he says.
Piech has to move faster and more rigorously than his rivals because VW has embarked late on restructuring.
He says VW must rationalise all of its operations from raw material purchases to final sales to the customer.
In eight years of boom we concentrated on expansion and we did not prepare for bad times.
We should break even with our plants working at 70 per cent or less of capacity.
We came into this crisis with a break even level of around 100 per cent of capacity.
From 1989 our sales volumes grew every year and our profits shrank every year.
We introduced continuous improvement or kaizen as the Japanese call it but not with great urgency.
With our western culture and western thinking we must make quantum leaps in continuous improvement.
Piech says that Volkswagen still needs 30 32 hours to build a Golf at its giant Wolfsburg works in Germany.
the best Japanese companies take 12 hours to build a car.
Within the VW group however it has some plants such as its Polo small car production facility at Pamplona in Spain that are reaching Japanese efficiency levels.
Before me the big plants worked like independent companies.
If we had a quality problem at one plant the other did not know how the problem was solved.
Since January VW has taken drastic measures but he accepts that it will take five to six years before VW has reached the target of a 70 per cent break even level.
Even the French the most effective European carmakers have had a 20 per cent cost advantage over Volkswagen says Piech and the best Japanese have a 25 30 per cent lead.
He insists that the competitive gap within Europe can be closed in two to three years however and he looks to the transformation of the Swiss watch industry for a model to show that the west can also match the Japanese.
This gives me confidence that with European creativity it does not just have to be European with western creativity we are absolutely in the position to face the Japanese and to win.

FT 22 JUN 93 Charisma of Lopez defeats GM s case.
CHARISMA alone was enough to persuade seven former General Motors managers to follow Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to new jobs at Volkswagen a Frankfurt court said yesterday writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
Rejecting claims from Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary that VW s hiring the men breached fair competition rules the court said in a written ruling that Mr Lopez s colleagues had tried to persuade him to stay with GM.
In the event they needed no urging having already told him before he decided to go that they wanted to continue working with him whatever happened.
The court also said that Opel had failed to convince it that any knowledge its former employees took with them was confidential and could not be transferred to VW.
Opel still plans to proceed with a full hearing on the case and meanwhile investigations are continuing into possible charges of industrial espionage against Mr Lopez and his associates.
VW fails to convince GM over car factory copying.
VOLKSWAGEN has failed to convince General Motors that its plans for a revolutionary car plant in Spain are not a copy of a project drafted previously by the US group.
We have a right to be sceptical Mr David Herman chairman of GM s German subsidiary Adam Opel said yesterday.
It would be a real tour de force if Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua GM s former procurement chief who is now at VW had managed to develop a new concept between mid March when he left the US and mid June when he announced VW s plans.
Mr Herman was responding to claims in a letter received from VW in which Mr Ferdinand Piech chairman said the German company did not have any confidential plans or documents about GM s ultra low cost factory project.
Mr Herman confirmed that he had written to Mr Piech before Mr Lopez s announcement suggesting that he consider the possible consequences if VW s project were the same as the one developed at GM under Mr Lopez s direction.
At the time Mr Herman wrote German state prosecutors were investigating the US group s complaints that Mr Lopez and colleagues took secret documents with them when they absconded to VW.
The German company has consistently rebutted the charges.
It will be extremely difficult for Adam Opel to show a profit this year Mr Gail Gunderson finance director said yesterday.
Confirming a slump in net earnings to DM202m (Dollars 119m) last year compared with DM1bn in 1991 he said he expected 1993 turnover to fall 18 per cent to about DM24bn.
The company had been profitable in the first five months Mr Gunderson added.
According to Mr Herman German registrations of new Opel brand vehicles had fallen 21 per cent to 244 000 in the first six months.
He could not see any grounds for optimism in the second half.
On the contrary we will have to adjust production in our works to further falls in demand he said.
FT 28 JUN 93 Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (1).
Shockwaves keep coming The pressures from hard hit vehicle makers are inevitably forcing a far reaching restructuring of the components industry.
Parts makers are drastically cutting the numbers of their own suppliers and are also moving towards global sourcing.
THE bruising legal battle betweeen General Motors and Volkswagen the biggest car makers in the US and Europe over the services of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has concentrated a harsh new light on the critical relationship of the world s leading vehicle makers with their components suppliers.
The conflict over Mr Lopez formerly global purchasing director for GM and since March VW s purchasing and production director has arisen as two of the world s top four vehicle makers are fighting to cut costs in order to staunch heavy losses (see profile page three).
The world s car and commercial vehicle makers in North America Europe and Japan are facing an unprecedented financial squeeze in the face of weak demand and the intensifying pressures of a global market.
With 50 70 per cent of the production cost of a car being accounted for by components and materials bought from outside suppliers it is the automotive components makers that are in the direct firing line as the vehicle makers seek to make good the damage that is being wrought in their own profit and loss accounts.
Last year the biggest shock waves in the automotive components sector were passing through General Motors army of suppliers in North America as the ailing giant of the US industry started to take drastic action to staunch its record losses.
This year the tremors have reached Europe where Volkswagen is being forced to undertake a wide ranging restructuring of its operations especially in Germany where it has become Europe s highest cost volume carmaker.
In spring last year he was plucked by GM in Detroit from its European operations to head its newly instituted worldwide purchasing organisation.
He also became a member of both of GM s key North American and European strategy boards.
His reputation for tough cost cutting and an innovative approach to forcing greater efficiency out of GM Europe s suppliers was quickly borne out in Detroit.
His supporters claimed that Mr Lopez was implementing a long overdue shake up of GM s ties with suppliers.
But some parts makers accused him of undermining their relationship with GM by putting existing contracts up for renegotiation and demanding unrealistic improvements in what they argued were already good productivity records and thin profit margins.
During his ultimately brief sojourn in the US Mr Lopez claimed that many US parts manufacturers were less competitive than those in Europe and were indeed capable of huge productivity improvements.
GM was trying to form a new closer partnership with its best suppliers including advising them on efficiency and offering long term contracts he argued.
Mr Ferdinand Piech the chairman of the management board of the troubled Volkswagen group since January was clearly impressed by the efficacy of the Lopez approach to dealing with suppliers and became convinced that he was the man he needed to help him lead a new industrial revolution at the German carmaker.
Stung by its loss of a key executive along with seven other members of the Lopez team GM is seeking retribution through the courts in Germany where Mr Lopez is now under investigation by the public prosecutor for alleged industrial espionage including the removal of hundreds of confidential GM documents detailing the manufacturing costs of each of Opel s plants in Germany along with the individual prices its pays for around 60 000 different components.
GM s allegations have been robustly rebuffed by VW and publicly Mr Piech is giving his unqualified support to Mr Lopez.
The battle between GM and VW must now be decided in the courts but the wider battle of the industry to cut costs and increase efficiency and quality will be played out in every relationship between the vehicle makers and their myriad suppliers.
The pressures on GM and VW are being felt by all vehicle producers and the crucial relationship between the assemblers and their suppliers is being fundamentally transformed.
The leading vehicle makers are creating global operations forcing the component producers to match this international expansion if they wish to maintain their central supplier roles.
The makers are trying to bring new products to the market faster by reducing product development time and the suppliers must play a key role in meeting this goal.
The vehicle manufacturers are seeking to spread more of the research and development burden for new products on to the component makers.
The leading suppliers are taking on the role of being systems producers rather than suppliers of individual components.
They are needing to commit themselves early in the product development cycle working closely with the carmakers through simultaneous engineering so that they are integrated into both the design and manufacturing engineering processes.
Longer term partnerships are emerging linking the vehicle producers with favoured key suppliers but replacing the old adversarial relationships is not always proving easy.
In the present case of Volkswagen for example the German carmaker insisted this month that the answer lay in pooling the mutual interests of suppliers and manufacturers by intensifying co operation between them.
Mr Lopez claimed that our policy is one of partnership not of opposition since this is a matter of survival for us all.
Some component makers facing demands from Wolfsburg for price cuts of up to 30 per cent over the next three years may retain a justifiable scepticism about how fairly the burdens of cost cutting are to be shared but there is little doubt of the rigour with which VW is launching its new approach.
Its conversion to new ways of conducting its purchasing operations has come late so it must move even faster than its rivals if it is to catch up.
It is planning a drastic reduction in the number of its component suppliers as it seeks to rationalise its production and purchasing operations.
According to Mr Piech VW is seeking to move to a system in which some of its leading suppliers will become so called logistical partners.
These first tier suppliers will take over responsibility for supplying complete modules rather than individual components.
Toyota has 220 logistical partners today says Mr Piech.
At present the VW division alone has 1 500 suppliers.
and Audi the group s executive car division has around 800.
Since the arrvial of Mr Lopez VW has moved quickly to start to build a global purchasing organisation with the aim of cutting its costs and reducing its dependence on its high cost German supply base.
Volkswagen has created seven purchasing centres around the world.
The regional purchasing offices have been set up to serve all four of the group s brand divisions Volkswagen Audi Seat and Skoda and under the Lopez system all the groups will be seeking to scour their regions for lower cost suppliers at high levels of quality and service.
The regional teams will include buyers individually specialising in electrical mechanical and chemical components and in plant equipment and general supplies.
According to Mr Frans Boot head of the recently established VW group purchasing office in the UK the group is seeking to standardise many components across model ranges to cut down the current unnecessary proliferation of parts we want to benefit from high volumes.
The pressures from the vehicle makers are inevitably forcing a far reaching restructuring of the components industry.
Players in the first tier of the industry are undertaking similar actions to the vehicle makers themselves.
They are drastically cutting the numbers of their own suppliers and are also moving to global sourcing as the pressure for rationalisation rapidly moves down through the ranks of the sector worldwide.
The industry traditionally highly fragmented is starting to become more concentrated.
The biggest groups are growing through acquisition as witnessed most recently by the UK group T N s purchase of Goetze the German piston ring maker.
At the same time large corporations for which the auto industry has previously played a somewhat peripheral role such as Siemens and Mannesmann are moving rapidly into specialist areas of the automotive components sector where they can bring their technological and financial strengths to bear.
According to a recent Economist Intelligence Unit study some 65 companies now have sales in the automotive components sector in excess of Dollars 1bn a year and this group alone accounts for more than 55 per cent of a total worldwide industry turnover estimated at around Dollars 400bn.
FT 13 JUL 93 Probe widens as secret GM papers are found.
Prosecutors look for link to VW production head.
GERMAN prosecutors are looking for links between Volkswagen s controversial new production director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and secret General Motors documents found in a Wiesbaden apartment according to legal officials.
The investigation of the US group s claims that Mr Lopez and junior colleagues took confidential information with them when they defected to VW this spring took a new turn yesterday after confirmation from Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary that the discovery included details of a top secret model it was planning.
It also emerged that Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre who lived in the apartment until recently was formerly involved in Opel s new model policy through his job as head of Opel s advance purchasing department.
Mr Alvarez was one of two Opel employees who switched to VW shortly after Mr Lopez head of global purchasing at GM joined the German company in March.
A further five members of his US team also moved to VW at around the same time.
We also have to see if there is proof that Mr Lopez has anything to do with the matter Mr Georg Nauth spokesman for the Darmstadt prosecutor s office said yesterday.
Interviews with VW and Opel employees were continuing but the issues raised by the Wiesbaden discovery made it hard to say how long the investigation would last Mr Nauth said.
If Mr Lopez had asked to see or saw the papers.
Four boxes of documents had been discovered which did not belong where they were found Mr Nauth added.
He refused to confirm that they included details of Opel s most important current project a cheap mini car codenamed the O car.
But that was not to say reports to that effect were wrong he noted.
The O car is due for launch in the second half of this decade.
The concept bears a striking resemblance to a projected people s car announced since Mr Lopez s arrival by Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman.
Opel s plans for a super lean works to make the vehicle provisionally earmarked for Hungary also closely match those unveiled recently by Mr Lopez for his homeland in the Basque country northern Spain.
Mr Lopez played a leading role in developing Opel s project and it was his disappointment that it would not be built in Spain which led to him leaving GM and being appointed head of production at VW.
VW which last week stated that the Basque works would not be built at this time yesterday repeated its claim that none of the documents was secret.
A lawyer speaking for Mr Alvarez made a similar claim although he admitted he had not seen the papers.
GM cautious on third quarter Page 22 FT 13 JUL 93 Opel leak shocks motor industry.
MOTOR industry executives yesterday expressed surprise at the German announcement that plans for Opel s top secret model had been found in a flat in Wiesbaden saying theirs was an industry that was generally free of industrial espionage.
They said manufacturers searching for ways of increasing competitiveness normally had relatively little difficulty keeping them in house thanks to the industry s confidentiality clause contract system.
Engineers senior managers and others with access at an early stage to new model programmes investment and technology strategies have these clauses written into their contracts and few have been known to abuse them.
The reason is fairly obvious in the case of anyone whose career is in the industry one UK motor industry executive who wished to remain anonymous said last night.
There might be a short term gain for someone moving confidential information from one company to another.
Put simply there would be nowhere else in the industry for that person to go.
The system has also survived substantial change in the organisation and processes of the industry which have meant that many more people than even five years ago necessarily have knowledge of key projects and strategies at an early stage.
The days when a car maker s board had all the good ideas and took decisions behind closed doors has gone said another.
If it s a significant project it will involve the use of a centralised computer database and require information and input at an early stage from people in middle management engineers and similar.
Allegations of industrial espionage are flying from GM to VW in a long and twisted tale.
The story of Volkswagen and Adam Opel has taken on all the characteristics of tales in the life of a circus.
a rich mix of escapology vanishing acts and fire eaters among the side shows.
On Thursday this week the waiting audience was offered a tantalising glimpse of the show when a handful of the players appeared in a Hamburg courtroom.
The occasion was a bid by the weekly magazine Der Spiegel to extricate itself from a muzzle fitted by the court at Volkswagen s request.
This was to stop it publishing further allegations of industrial espionage against the company s new production director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and some of his colleagues who followed him to VW from GM.
He his colleagues and VW were represented by a single lawyer.
The magazine was backed by more than 20 witnesses four from the US all of them from General Motors prepared to back allegations and their affidavits with testimony.
GM and Adam Opel its German subsidiary which have initiated criminal investigations in Germany and the US on the basis of their suspicions that Mr Lopez and his team stole confidential information before defecting to VW in March were not directly involved.
The effect was that of a hall of mirrors the GM troupe flashed in and out of view in the courthouse corridors for once with nothing to say to the media.
From the outset VW has steadfastly refused to answer questions on the accusations of industrial espionage.
But the Hamburg hearing a sideshow to the main event the direct clash between VW and GM offered startling insights into the core of the US group s legal case and uncomfortable reflections on Mr Lopez.
Ms Toni Simonetti formerly an aide to Mr Lopez testified he had dictated to her a fulsome speech a proclamation of love for GM and its people intended as his explanation for staying in Detroit despite the lures of Wolfsburg where VW has it headquarters.
Mr Lopez has repeatedly and formally denied he had anything to do with the speech.
Ms Simonetti may have noted overheard comments Mr Lopez s lawyer offered on his behalf.
Mr Lopez had made final adjustments to the speech on the morning of March 15.
He had disappeared only to turn up the next day as production and purchasing director of Volkswagen.
The circus stopped in Hamburg this week after a journey which has so far lasted almost 16 months.
It started last spring in a small way as Mr Carl Hahn then chairman of Volkswagen Europe s biggest car maker began searching for his successor.
He was to retire in December at what was to prove a grim moment in his career.
Having taken over SEAT in Spain Skoda in Czechoslovakia and setting up an assembly plant in China all during the 1980s he had built an impressive looking international group.
In the first quarter of this year after an 87 per cent profits plunge in 1992 the Volkswagen group showed a DM1.
In March last year Mr Hahn approached Mr Louis Hughes then chairman of arch rival Adam Opel offering him the top VW job.
Shortly afterwards he was appointed head of GM Europe.
The job of VW chairman fell to Mr Ferdinand Piech head of the luxury car division Audi.
Although not at the time a member of the group s main board he was respected for his technical skills and building the Audi brand into a fitting though still small rival to BMW and Mercedes Benz.
A grandson of Ferdinand Porsche the man who developed the VW Beetle he had they say petrol in his blood.
Even before he took charge at VW Mr Piech was in talks with Mr Lopez.
Like him Mr Lopez was a brilliant engineer who wanted a robust European motor industry led by VW able to repel Japanese.
But while Mr Piech was a cool Austrian and vastly rich through his Porsche family links Mr Lopez was a volatile Basque of more humble origins driven by ambitions for political influence in his homeland.
At the time the only apparent difficulty was that Mr Lopez worked for General Motors.
In tribute to his achievements in cutting costs at Adam Opel mainly by squeezing price cuts out of parts suppliers that he had been moved to Detroit to work his restorative magic on the ailing GM parent last year.
The circus an overlapping succession of bizarre events was about the start.
The two men had met secretly before Christmas then again in the new year.
They deny anything was agreed then although they have since agreed on how they came together.
through an intermediary not as Mr Piech told this newspaper last month through a direct approach from Mr Lopez.
In late February officials of the Lower Saxony government VW s largest shareholder let it be known that Mr Lopez was formally to be inducted as a VW director on March 16.
GM meanwhile which had already tried to buy him back by promoting him to group vice president and global purchasing chief confidently announced.
On March 7 he flew to Frankfurt for a two day meeting of GM s international strategy board where according to Mr Jack Smith group president all future products were to be discussed.
These include a new Astra Opel s rival to the Golf and a top secret cheap mini car.
Some of the new models as emerged in Hamburg on Thursday were on display including the successor to the Opel Vectra.
Mr John Howell director of business planning at GM Europe told the Hamburg court that on March 8 the first day of the meeting after two long presentations Mr Lopez and other directors asked for copies of the papers presented there.
Mr Howell said he specifically remembered giving Mr Lopez a sheaf about 2cm thick.
Mr Lopez has formally declared that he remembered asking only for four or five charts all relating to a secret new plant project for GM known as Plateau 6 on which he had worked for 18 months.
None of the documents has since been found GM says.
It was at this strategy meeting that Mr Lopez learnt that Plateau 6 had been earmarked for Hungary if it was to be built not his native Basque country even though it is understood he had arranged a deal with a local consortium to pay for and construct the building.
It was also at the meeting he said last month that he lost his enthusiasm for GM.
He resigned two days later on Thursday March 11.
The next Sunday he was back on board at GM.
Press officials announced he would give a press conference at 1pm on Monday March 15.
According to Ms Simonetti s testimony he dictated the outlines of his hello again speech to her on the Saturday evening.
One of the issues was the (Plateau 6) advanced manfacturing concept.
stronger level of commitment with regard to the plant in Spain.
we must match very good offer from VW.
After amending a final draft on the Monday morning he vanished and was appointed to the VW board the next day.
An immediate search of his office failed to turn up secret documents including the 2cm wad Mr Howell said he had handed over to him.
A search on March 17 of offices occupied by Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez Mr Lopez s closest colleague for details of a top secret diesel engine allegedly in his possession (formally denied by Mr Gutierrez) was also fruitless.
Mr Gutierrez on a GM business trip to Japan on that day also failed to return to Detroit.
But it was not until March 24 that GM revealed the scale of VW s coup.
as well as Mr Gutierrez in charge of machinery buying Mr Hugo van der Auwera metals purchasing Mr Francisco Garcia electrical parts buyer and Mr Andre Versteeg a more junior buyer had flown the coop.
Two Adam Opel staff Mr Jose Alvarez and Mr Ramon Piazza had also elected to join their former boss in Wolfsburg.
On April 2 Opel won a court order barring VW from trying to lure more of its key German staff.
Some had been called by Mr Lopez and offered doubled salaries to defect.
However Opel later failed in a bid to win an injunction preventing its former employees for working at VW for a year.
The court ruled that Mr Lopez s charisma had been responsible for their leaving.
On April 30 German prosecutors began investigating GM claims of industrial espionage despite claims from VW that none of its new employees made off with secrets.
Mr David Herman new head of Opel.
A partial answer emerged earlier this month when state prosecution officials discovered four large boxes of papers including details of the top secret O car the vehicle to be built in the projected Plateau 6 plant in a Wiesbaden apartment with the names J Alvarez and R Piazza on the doorbell.
VW remains inscrutable insisting none of its new employees have any GM documents.
Last Thursday after the Hamburg judge said he would issue a ruling on the Der Spiegel case VW s lawyer challenged the confidentiality of the disputed documents although he has not seen them.
He asked why it should be unusual for senior executives to have secret information.
Yet there is no mistaking the mounting anticipation in the GM team.
They are convinced that investigating prosecutors at last have something in to which to sink their teeth.
Moreover they feel it is nearly time for the ringmaster to bring out the lions.
FT 21 JUL 93 VW to face more scrutiny in secrets dispute.
THE latest twist yesterday in Germany s industrial secrets row indicates that Volkswagen is set to face increasing pressure on a number of issues relating to its appointment of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as a director.
Speculation is mounting that as an early development state prosecutors investigating possible criminal charges will make a formal statement later this week on inquiries so far.
The decision by a Hamburg civil court to loosen reporting restrictions imposed last month on Der Spiegel Germany s leading news weekly will re open the public debate on claims by General Motors of the US and its German subsidiary Adam Opel that Mr Lopez a former GM director and several of his associates who joined VW with him took industrial secrets with them to the German group.
After yesterday s ruling which followed an open hearing last Thursday the magazine can resume reporting on its earlier claims that Mr Lopez took boxes of secrets with him when he quit GM in March.
It may also pursue its charges that Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez a close associate of Mr Lopez who followed his former GM chief to VW almost immediately asked for and was given strictly confidential details of a new GM diesel engine.
The court which imposed a gagging order at VW s request last month after the publication of two detailed articles also lifted the injunction in regard to a claim that Mr Lopez had reached an agreement to join VW with Mr Ferdinand Piech at the start of this year.
In an affidavit presented in court last week and signed by Mr Piech the VW chairman stated that Mr Lopez decided to move on March 9.
The court also received testimony that Mr Lopez had in effect written a speech intended to explain to GM employees why he had decided not to join VW which was not in the event delivered.
After checking the final draft on the morning of March 15 he left the US for Germany.
Mr Lopez stated in an affidavit presented last Thursday that he did not write it and that it had been written by GM.
Mr Lopez and VW were represented at the hearing by a single lawyer while Der Spiegel had more than 20 witnesses all GM employees on hand to support its case.
All the claims on which the court loosened the gag yesterday have been firmly and consistently denied by VW and its executives although as Mr Harald Ficus presiding judge said last week his court was not the place for deciding the truth or otherwise of the suspicions aired in Der Spiegel.
However Volkswagen was obliged to bear most of the costs of the case.
In German courts apportionment of costs shows the extent to which the parties involved have gained or lost according to legal experts.
On the single issue of Der Spiegel s reports on the diesel engine secrets Mr Gutierrez was made responsible for the whole DM100 000 (Pounds 38 759) in costs.
In another case which concerned complaints made in the German group s name including Mr Piech s claims on the planning and timing of Mr Lopez s switch VW was obliged to pay two thirds of the DM500 000 costs.
FT 22 JUL 93 GM VW inquiry statement due.
FRESH light is expected to be shed on the industrial espionage battle between General Motors and Volkswagen later today when criminal investigators are due to issue their first formal statement since they started the search for evidence in late April.
The Darmstadt state prosecutor s office which took up the investigation at GM s request after Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua defected from GM to VW in March said its statement would cover progress so far.
Most interest is focused on recent finds especially four boxes discovered on July 12 in a Wiesbaden apartment previously occupied by two of Mr Lopez s colleagues.
The duo quit GM s German subsidiary Adam Opel shortly after Mr Lopez was appointed production and procurement director at VW.
The cartons are known to have contained details of a secret new car model but it is understood that further confidential information was also discovered.
Mr Lopez and his associates backed by VW and the group s supervisory board have consistently denied that they took or delivered any secrets to VW.
The state prosecutors who launched their probe after GM established grounds for suspicion of industrial spying by presenting affidavits from its employees have already interviewed more than 30 employees of the US based automotive group.
VW staff have also been called in but it is understood that Mr Lopez and his associates who joined him at VW when he quit General Motors have yet to be interviewed.
Mr Lopez and Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez his closest aide at GM and now at VW are believed to be on holiday.
Personal testimony and affidavits from GM staff played a key role in a Hamburg court ruling earlier this week in which VW failed to prevent Der Spiegel news magazine from continuing to publish allegations of industrial espionage against VW and its employees.
Opel said yesterday that if VW pressed on with a full court hearing to try to reimpose a gag on Der Spiegel it expected its employees would be prepared to appear again to support the magazine s case.
Volkswagen confirmed that it was considering restarting legal proceedings after this week s setback but it wanted to see the court s reasoned opinion on the rulings first.
According to VW it could be several weeks before the written opinion is ready.
Discovery of data seen as link with ex GM executive.
the investigation relates to documents which were not at the disposal of Volkswagen AG.
Volkswagen AG cannot comment on details of the press release issued by the Darmstadt Public Prosecutor s Office.
Despite numerous requests to inspect the contents of the boxes to date the defence counsel of the affected employee who has again confirmed that no secret documents of Opel AG or General Motors Corporation had been found in his possession has been denied access.
The conduct of the Public Prosecutor s Office has thereby prevented the employee from giving his views on the contents of the box.
Evidently the Public Prosecutor s Office can only base its assessment of the contents of the boxes on information from Adam Opel AG GM Corporation which makes it completely one sided.
The comments of the Public Prosecutor s Office that Mr Lopez had part of the documents translated into German is easily explained.
managers who operate on a global basis naturally have talks and presentations translated into the local language.
The press release by the Public Prosecutor s Office does not give the supervisory and management boards of VW any reason to reproach Mr Lopez.
FT 26 JUL 93 Biggest VW shareholder backs Lopez.
MR Gerhard Schroder prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony has restated his support for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua Volkswagen s production director despite mounting evidence to support industrial spying allegations against him.
The statement from Mr Schroder followed a hurriedly called meeting on Friday with Mr Ferdinand Piech group chairman.
The state s 20 per cent stake lost an estimated DM300m (Pounds 116m) of its value last week as legal setbacks lopped 7 per cent off VW shares.
It has since emerged that Mr Lopez linked last Thursday by state prosecutors with one batch of confidential documents belonging to General Motors his former employer and found in a Wiesbaden house had personally collected some of the others.
In early February more than a month before he abruptly joined VW he visited Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary from his Detroit base to attend meetings called at his request.
On February 3 and 4 during the presentations he asked managers from the group s European subsidiaries for papers on purchasing cost and new model strategies.
Some of these later turned up in four boxes in the former Wiesbaden home of two of his Opel colleagues who followed him to VW.
On the afternoon of February 4 a call was made from his office near Frankfurt to Wolfsburg the VW headquarters.
Whom he called is not clear but according to an extract from his office diary for that day reproduced in today s edition of the news magazine Der Spiegel Mr Lopez had noted.
The magazine suggested this could have referred to a meeting with Mr Jens Neumann the VW director responsible for group strategy.
However the distances involved suggest a meeting was unlikely.
The next day when Mr Lopez was to attend talks in Zurich at GM Europe he cancelled all appointments and turned up unexpectedly at Eisenach in eastern Germany Opel s newest car factory and asked for documents on the plant s lean production systems.
Public prosecutors investigating GM s suspicions of espionage last week stated that transparencies also found in the boxes and regarded as confidential by GM had also been expressly requested and translated into German by Mr Lopez.
Der Spiegel which last week was freed from a reporting gag on the case imposed through a temporary injunction granted to VW last month yesterday quoted a senior VW employee as saying the prosecutors statement sparked blind panic in Wolfsburg.
It also claimed an eye witness had seen Mr Lopez s associates Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza using two shredding machines in the house.
The shredding took place after the two had quit Opel.
FT 30 JUL 93 Probe launched into perjury claims in VW Opel battle.
GERMAN prosecutors have started investigating suspicions that Volkswagen director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others may have committed perjury and speculation grew yesterday that he could soon be charged in connection with allegations of industrial espionage.
Hamburg state prosecutors confirmed the opening of an investigation following suggestions that they should examine discrepancies between testimony and affidavits presented in evidence at a recent civil hearing.
The hearing related to the continuing clash between VW and Adam Opel the General Motors German subsidiary.
Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab vice president of GM Europe said yesterday he felt that prosecutors had enough evidence for criminal charges.
The public prosecutors office following thorough examination and investigation confirms that (Opel s) suspicions are justified.
According to its own statements the office has made decisive progress he said.
Meanwhile the federal government was asked to mediate in the battle and a senior official in the Bonn economics ministry urged the state of Lower Saxony to sell its 19.
Mr Reinhard Gohner state secretary criticised Mr Gerhard Schroder prime minister of Lower Saxony for defending VW managers and said it was inappropriate for politicians to be involved.
The spying row was damaging the image of German industry and could be fatal if it was not resolved soon he said.
Mr Klaus Bregger head of the influential MIT association which represents medium sized companies appealed to Mr Gunter Rexrodt federal economics minister to act as a mediator.
He reminded the minister that every sixth job in Germany depended on the motor industry.
Concern over the case soared yesterday following claims this week from Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman that he was at war with GM and indirect allegations that incriminating evidence against Mr Lopez and his colleagues had been planted.
Mr Gab rejected as grotesque Mr Piech s charges that Opel an American company was seeking to destroy VW.
Opel ensured employment for 400 000 people in Germany he said.
He said Mr Piech an Austrian who did not carry a German passport was mobilising national sentiments in his host country in a manner that burdened German industry as a whole.
The VW chairman s attitude reflected a psychosis like bunker mentality Mr Gab added.
The suggestion of a perjury probe came from lawyers of Adam Opel.

FT 31 JUL 93 VW head seeks talks with GM over espionage dispute.
THE HEAD of Volkswagen has asked for talks with his counterpart at General Motors in an attempt to defuse the increasingly bitter row between the two automotive groups over charges of industrial espionage.
Mr Ferdinand Piech had contacted Mr Jack Smith proposing a meeting to discuss the matter between our concerns without influencing the legal conflict VW claimed yesterday.
He had also been in touch with Mr Gunter Rexrodt the German economics minister to discuss his initiative ministry officials said.
Mr Piech s call to Bonn followed an offer from Mr Rexrodt to act as a mediator.
A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt hoped the two sides would moderate their language and allow legal procedures to take their natural course.
Mr Rexrodt warned both sides in a television broadcast on Thursday night to take care not to damage Germany s reputation as too many jobs were at risk.
General Motors officials yesterday could not confirm that VW had made contact with Mr Smith who is travelling during the group s two week summer break.
But they admitted they were surprised by the initiative so soon after Mr Piech had been reported as saying that he would not let anyone pee on our leg.
VW spokesmen were also apparently unaware that Mr Piech had spoken to Mr Rexrodt.
They were unable to confirm that the VW chairman would renew contacts with Mr Smith at the start of next week as the group said in a press release yesterday.
In an unexpected outbreak of diplomacy Mr Piech appeared to be responding to mounting political pressure to break the spiral of charge and counter charge.
He told a press conference earlier this week that he saw little hope of a peaceful or early end to the row which is focused on the US group s allegations that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua its former global purchasing director and several associates systematically plundered industrial secrets from GM and its European subsidiaries before defecting to VW in March.
Describing the conflict as a war Mr Piech also insinuated that GM its German subsidiary Adam Opel or their agents could have conspired to pervert the course of justice by planting evidence implicating Mr Lopez and his team.
His suggestion of talks also followed confirmation from the US Justice Department in Washington that it had opened inquiries into the case on its own initiative because of interest within the department in industrial espionage in multinational companies.
FT 04 AUG 93 VW s board shows cracks over GM row.
MR Ferdinand Piech Volkswagen chairman has suffered a setback in moves to defuse the company s row with General Motors.
Following Mr Piech s attempts to initiate contacts with GM last week Mr Jack Smith president of the US car group informed Mr Piech in a letter received yesterday that all future communication on the espionage affair should be in writing and with Mr David Herman chairman of Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary.
Meanwhile the first cracks have appeared in the VW supervisory board s hitherto solid backing for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua former purchasing chief at GM and now VW production director.
Mr Klaus Volkert representing the group s workforce on the board which oversees and appoints top management said if charges against Mr Lopez seemed likely he would withdraw his support.
Mr Herman has told Mr Piech he must publicly withdraw insinuations that Opel could have tampered with evidence in the industrial spying case which has wrecked relations between the two car groups.
Withdrawal was a condition of further contacts Mr Herman said on Monday night.
Late last week a day after he made a series of outspoken attacks on GM Mr Piech s public relations team revealed he had telephoned Mr Smith with the aim of opening talks.
GM officials were caught unawares by the initiative they were unable to contact Mr Smith away on leave and have now used it to try to force Mr Piech into a corner.
The VW chief has been under intense pressure from the Bonn government and colleagues in German industry to seek conciliation following his outspoken statements last week which were widely seen as damaging Germany s reputation.
Mr Piech said last week he regarded the confrontation between the two groups as a war designed to damage VW and the German motor industry.
He would win he said and warned Fiat and Peugeot that they could be the next targets.
Opel had misused the public prosecutor s office the media and public opinion he charged.
He claimed the US group was leading a personal vendetta against Mr Lopez.
Mr Lopez just back from holiday is expected to be questioned soon by public prosecutors on suspicions of his involvement in industrial espionage.
An investigation by the US Justice Department has added a political dimension to the affair.

FT 06 AUG 93 VW looks for a smoother ride.
AS Mr Ferdinand Piech is growing to appreciate foot in mouth disease is a painful affliction.
The Volkswagen chairman and self proclaimed saviour to be of the European car industry may yet discover that it is also difficult and costly to cure writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
Following repeated manifestations over the past few weeks Mr Piech s case will be subjected to a close examination at an extraordinary meeting of VW s supervisory board in Wolfsburg tonight.
The sitting was called by Mr Klaus Liesen chairman of Essen based Ruhrgas and head of the VW supervisory board and Mr Piech himself to discuss the state of the business and the matter between Volkswagen and General Motors of the US and its German subsidiary Adam Opel.
The summons followed signs of wavering in the board after a series of public relations catastrophes which thickened rather than dispersed the clouds of suspicion circling Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua production director and linchpin of Mr Piech s recovery programme.
Mr Klaus Volkert senior representative of the workforce on the supervisory board on which union employee and Social Democrat party officials hold 11 of the 20 seats said if spying charges against Mr Lopez seemed likely he would withdraw his support.
Until then the board had agreed to stand fast even if Mr Lopez former head of GM s global procurement was charged with industrial espionage until the charges were proven.
Mr Volkert s resolve appeared to wobble after a miscued offensive last week in which Mr Piech said the public prosecutor s office was biased and accused GM of shady manoeuvrings and a personal vendetta against Mr Lopez with the aim of destroying VW.
Indirectly he named Opel as US agent provocateur in an economic war against the European motor industry.
Mr Piech apparently unawares had selected a boomerang for his attack.
It brought in its wake a storm of outrage from all sides of German industry and politics.
There were calls for Mr Lopez to be either fired or suspended pending charges or a court verdict.
But the main message was that Mr Piech and his nationalist tones were damaging Germany s reputation.
His offensive designed to offset damage done in a recent court case when VW failed to prevent Der Spiegel a news weekly from reporting detailed suspicions of spying against Mr Lopez had backfired.
The irony is that the investment community whole heartedly accepts that his and Mr Lopez s vigorous restructuring efforts are already having a substantial effect and profits will start to grow next year.
But even among such cool heads there is bewilderment at constant claims that the group will be out of the red by the end of this year.
According to analysts calculations a loss of around DM700m (Pounds 270m) is unavoidable.
The charitable answer is that Mr Piech blinkered by his zeal for saving VW and believing the results would speak for themselves may have scope for improvement as a public relations man.
Similar questions may arise at tonight s meeting at which Mr Piech is expected to concede that his cost cutting drive has left gaping holes in his PR defences which need to be filled possibly with a new management board director.
But at the end of the night supervisors will almost certainly close ranks with managers.
Mr Liesen Mr Volkert and his colleagues executives of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank the premier of Lower Saxony and other worthies are the men who chose the managers they believed best able to save Europe s biggest car maker.
Mr Piech has staked his reputation on his belief in Mr Lopez.
FT 07 AUG 93 VW says recruits destroyed GM papers.
VOLKSWAGEN last night said that former General Motors employees who joined VW in March brought or had sent to Germany documents containing possibly critical information.
But it said the men destroyed the documents to avoid any danger they might find their way into VW s possession.
VW s supervisory board which oversees management of the German car group debated its row with GM over allegations of industrial espionage at an extraordinary meeting that lasted late into the evening.
VW said the discussion was based on an explanation of the facts sent by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to prosecutors investigating allegations of espionage against him and three colleagues.
Mr Lopez switched from GM to VW as production director in mid March and was followed by his colleagues.
There were no findings to warrant accusations of espionage VW said and the board restated its trust in Mr Lopez.
It also stressed the group s claims that no secret documents came into VW s possession from its new employees.
The carefully worded VW statement made no connections between the documents and any specific staff.
But its contents appeared to confirm eye witness reports of shredders working all night in mid April in a house in Wiesbaden.
The house was occupied at the time by Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza two former employees of Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary and associates of Mr Lopez who joined him at VW on March 22.
In June four removal company boxes filled with papers and other data including details of a top secret mini car to be built by Opel were discovered in the house and handed over to police.
Some of the data had been assembled at the specific request of Mr Lopez.
Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman last week implied GM could have planted secrets in the boxes to incriminate former employees.
The VW statement also revealed that documents had been destroyed at a hotel believed to be near Wolfsburg the VW headquarters.
In Wiesbaden as well as in the Rothehof guesthouse the former GM employees took pains to ensure that documents which could possibly be traced to GM and could contain critical information were destroyed to avoid the danger of their being distributed within Volkswagen the statement said.
Over the past few months VW has vigorously contested Opel s claims that any secrets were involved in the affair.
Speaking after the hurriedly called meeting of the supervisory board Mr Piech said VW made a loss of DM355m (Pounds 140m) in the second quarter of the current financial year bringing the total deficit for the first half to DM1.
But the company said it could achieve a turn round by the end of the year.
FT 09 AUG 93 VW versus the old school.
We can let our industrial structure collapse like the English did and then the Japanese will come here and have us build cars in Germany from mostly prefabricated parts.
For that you need a couple of young people and they will be more than glad to have any kind of a job says Mr Ferdinand Piech.
The Volkswagen chairman may not be much of a diplomat but as a visionary he is worth a hearing.
It is readily acknowledged that much of German industry is overweight overmanned and overdue for an overhaul.
His colleagues in industry goggled enviously last March when he recruited Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua General Motors star procurement chief and seven of Mr Lopez s parts buying warriors.
They were shocked when GM was forced to use the courts to stop his attempt to lure another 40 from the buying department at Adam Opel the GM German subsidiary.
GM s espionage charges were stunning in themselves and Mr Piech s more recent nationalistic war declarations and charges that GM had conspired to pervert the course of justice deeply disturbed the political and industrial establishment.
But the smoke and noise from these fronts have tended to obscure another conflict at ground level where Mr Lopez s warriors are bludgeoning price cuts out of VW suppliers.
Late last week the VDMA engineering and plant makers association begged for mercy and a return to civilised ways of doing business.
Large industrial customers especially the motor industry were using extortion and extreme aggression it said.
Parts buyers demanded to be given foundry moulds and construction drawings saying continuity of supply had to be ensured should the suppliers go bust.
Such bully boy tactics were previously unknown in the co operative consensus oriented world of German commerce.
Still no one least of all General Motors can deny the efficacy of the Lopez slimming cure.
It made Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary into the most profitable carmaker in Europe when he was based there in the 1980s.
And last week the US parent surprised the world with a Dollars 889m second quarter net profit compared with a Dollars 703m loss a year earlier.
Most striking of all was the fall in the deficit in the core north American business from Dollars 761m to Dollars 95m all attributed to cost savings.
Mr Lopez and his warriors had been at work in Detroit for just 10 months when they left in March.
Success at Opel however came when the German economy was expanding.
And results in the US were achieved in a no holds barred free market that is far more flexible far more used to implementing harsh hire and fire policies than Germany s vaunted social economy.
It is clear from the German engineering association s claims that other companies are now following the Lopez example put brutally kicking the man on the next rung down the ladder.
Instead of calm consensus there is a growing atmosphere of every man for himself.
Bosch however the country s mightiest car parts supplier and a company of the old more courteous school believes it can stand above the fray.
It says it will follow its own cost reduction plans at its own pace and refuse to bow to unreasonable demands.
The company s executives suggest privately that an organised front among lesser companies could deny VW its clamour for pound after pound of flesh.
The absence of public backing for VW s policies and tactics from industry or the political establishment although both are anxious for a lasting cure to Germany s economic ills suggests VW is moving out on a limb.
An extraordinary meeting of the company s supervisory board called unexpectedly on Friday resulted in an extraordinary display of confidence in the effectiveness and honesty of VW s dream team.
But the fact that it was called at all when most of Germany was away on holiday demonstrated mounting pressure.
Even if Mr Piech pulls off his ambition of returning VW to break even this year and profit thereafter it is likely to be partly at the expense of the components industry.
All native German automotive companies basic strategies depend on increased purchasing of parts from abroad and on moving vehicle production closer to markets and into lower cost production zones outside Germany.
Most Volkswagen included see this as the best long term solution to their difficulties.
But VW the country s biggest carmaker and by definition its biggest components user by aggressively pursuing its own immediate aims could damage the close knit network of component suppliers and the collaborative relationship between German carmakers.
In the longer term this could put at risk the home base on which the whole industry relies to sustain its long term metamorphosis.
Mr Piech explains his ardour with claims that the German industry has only two years the time before Japan s current voluntary quotas expire to match up to its arch competitors cost structures.
But even he accepts he cannot come within striking distance in less than three years.
That his more traditionally minded long termist colleagues at Mercedes Benz BMW and elsewhere have not thrown their weight behind him suggests they still need to be persuaded he is on to a winner.
The legal threats confronting Mr Lopez on whom the VW chairman has staked his reputation do not improve his chances of success.
FT 13 AUG 93 VW probe may recall witnesses.
PUBLIC prosecutors investigating spying and theft allegations against Volkswagen employees may recall witnesses for further questioning following reports that data belonging to Adam Opel the German subsidiary of General Motors may have been punched into VW computers.
The possibility arose yesterday after a televised claim that a female VW employee had said she and nine colleagues had been instructed to store material by an assistant to Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua VW s new production director and the man at the centre of the investigation.
The woman allegedly already interrogated had apparently said nothing about the origins of the material when questioned.
However she reportedly told a third party that the documents carried an Opel logo.
Mr Georg Nauth a senior prosecutor and spokesman for the investigators said the reports would be checked.
It is understood several witnesses from VW under questioning have said they could not remember or could not rule out whether material they handled bore marks identifying their origins as either Opel or GM.
Mr Walter Hiller a member of the VW supervisory board said yesterday the board had been credibly assured at a meeting last Friday that an internal investigation at VW found there was no such material in the group s data banks.
The meeting unanimously backed Mr Lopez and said there was no evidence to warrant accusations of industrial espionage.
Meanwhile Opel threatened further legal action if VW did not tell it in precise detail the nature and contents of material destroyed in the week of March 22 on instructions of Mr Lopez.
VW last weekend admitted that papers including possibly secret or sensitive material were destroyed at its company guesthouse to prevent its circulation within VW.
Christopher Parkes chronicles the clashes between Volkswagen and GM.
On January 1 Ferdinand Piech was installed as chairman of Volkswagen.
He already knew the approximate scale of the task ahead of him.
The company was losing an estimated DM400 on every Golf it sold.
Its six German works could break even only if operated at more than 100 per cent of capacity.
As was to emerge later full year net earnings crashed almost 90 per cent to DM147m (Pounds 57.
As Dan Jones the motor industry guru and co author of The machine that changed the world was to remark.
VW needed a man like Piech to put a bomb under the group.
The 56 year old Austrian engineer had come eagerly to Wolfsburg VW s headquarters in Lower Saxony from the relative calm of the Audi quality car division in Ingoldstadt Bavaria where he had been chairman.
The man who once boasted that he could drive the 120km winding route from Ingoldstadt to Munich without taking his foot off the accelerator was pressing on the pedal even before he had his hands on the wheel.
In mid November 1992 through the good offices of Bosch Germany s biggest and most secretive vehicle components maker he met his soul mate Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
Piech s aim was to lure Lopez away from his job as vice president in charge of procurement at General Motors in Detroit and install him in Wolfsburg.
Lopez an eccentric visionary Basque engineer had been given his GM job in May.
He had been chosen by Jack Smith GM president to save the suffering automotive giant by applying his rigorous cost reduction tactics through the agency of his troupe of so called purchasing department warriors.
Lopez had earned his stripes and his nickname the Russelsheim strangler as head of purchasing at Adam Opel the US group s German subsidiary.
Thanks largely to him Russelsheim based Opel had become the most profitable car maker in the country.
Smith knew in December Lopez says that he had been approached by VW.
But then as he did consistently through the following months the Spaniard was to assure the group president and his top level colleagues that he would not leave.
As a trusted executive he went about his business unhindered.
When he quit abruptly on March 10 this year suspicions mushroomed about his and his closest allies activities in the interim in which box loads of secret and confidential data about most of GM s future European plans were allegedly systematically collected only to disappear.
With hindsight GM now suspects he may already have been working on VW s behalf as early as December 2 last year.
On that day he asked for and received 20 days later GM Europe s so called Epos list.
computer stored details of parts prices and suppliers equivalent to up to 90 000 print out sheets.
According to Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab vice president of GM Europe they were of no use to him in his US based job.

accuses Opel of mudslinging conducting an international war against VW and Germany and suggests saying there were other hands involved that GM Opel planted secrets in Wiesbaden and may have hacked into VW s computers to plant secrets there.
He says he has ordered an internal electronic audit.
In Darmstadt meanwhile investigators have received from Neumann a detailed chronology of the tug of war in early March when Jack Smith tried to snatch Lopez back from VW.
Hans Wilhelm Gab vice president of GM Europe describes Piech attacks as grotesque.
The VW chairman s warlike words suggested a psychosis like bunker mentality.
Piech calls Smith in bid to call off the offensive.
The VW chairman is told there will be no further communications until he withdraws his allegations and even then any contacts should be in writing with David Herman Opel chairman.
Klaus Liesen returns from holiday in Majorca to chair an emergency meeting of the VW supervisory board following signs of wavering support among members and complaints that they were not being kept fully informed.
Lopez appears to contradict his earlier public claim that he never took any secret documents and tells board that papers from his former offices were destroyed including possibly secret or sensitive GM Opel material in Wiesbaden and during his stay at the group s Rotehof guesthouse in late March.
The aim was to avoid any danger that such data could be circulated within VW he says.
The board s statement after the meeting which pledges Lopez unaltered support and says no grounds were found to warrant accusations of industrial espionage notes.
No possibly secret documents left the possession of former GM employees and came into the possession of VW.
Opel welcomes the belated admission that documents had been destroyed and returns to the attack with a reminder that the investigations also include suspicions of theft fraud and perjury.
Based on the present status of the investigation it is apparent that in a concerted action thousands of pages of highly sensitive data concerning cost structures manufacturing and future planning were stolen Opel says.
Prosecutors interrogate Daniel Goeudevert the former VW director displaced on July 2.
Although out of the inner circle he is likely to be well informed on the timing and details of the initial contacts between Piech and Lopez.
Nauth the prosecutors spokesman says VW witnesses will be re examined after reports that a female employee had told a third party that she had seen the Opel logo on data she punched into the VW computer system under instructions from an assistant to Lopez.
Opel reveals that the FBI has demanded to see all GM group data and affidavits relevant to the case.
In Wolfsburg almost 12 weeks after public prosecutors said they had enough evidence to support a criminal investigation the VW supervisory board says it has appointed auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand to carry out an independent probe within Volkswagen.
Der Spiegel claims a dozen VW trainees punched GM Opel data into VW computers at the end of March.
Basques in the home town of VW s Jose Lopez think he is a hero whether or not they get a car plant.
There are about a million square meters of green wooded hillside just outside Amorebieta on the road between Bilbao and Guernica in Spain waiting to be flattened and developed.
The homesteaders still living on it were paid for their property by the provincial government two years ago when it was thought McDonnell Douglas might build aircraft wings there.
Nothing happened but for the past year another dream has enveloped the people of the town.
One of their own studious little Josein who used to live by the river had made good and was going to bring a car factory to town.
The dream originated in the head of Josein Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua while he was advancing through the ranks to the top level of management at General Motors of the US.
In March this year he took it with him allegedly together with caseloads of secret GM plans and documents when he fled the US group for Volkswagen.
Mr Lopez had worked for 18 months at GM on a project for a revolutionary plant in which cars could be built in a fraction of the time taken in conventional factories.
Claiming disillusionment and dismay when he learnt the US group favoured eastern Europe for any new capacity he accepted an oral pledge from Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman and left for Germany.
Mr Lopez had a hand in preparing the generous terms on which the factory was to be built by a local consortium and in the leasing deal under which GM and later VW would pay rent according to the number of cars built.
The land was free and the plant operator would pay no taxes for 12 years.
At one point it seemed as though GM and VW might even fight over the site.
After all Josein had flown to Madrid in June to give a press conference to say it would happen.
Now their champion is in trouble struggling to survive in a storm of controversy after a criminal investigation in Germany of alleged industrial espionage.
In Amorebieta they blame GM which asked for the investigation for being a sore loser.
But the car plant idea has gone and now no one believes it will come.
Mr Lopez himself was told recently by Mr Piech that the German car industry s worst crisis since the war was not the time to be building new capacity.
By all accounts young Josein was a quiet popular boy in the town.
His father worked in a local tool factory and his mother later ran a bar the Zuri Beltz (black and white).
While he was growing up the Basque Country was brought to its knees by Franco.
He and his friends were careful not to speak their native Basque in front of strangers.
Nevertheless Amorebieta grew to become an important metalworking centre.
Its population just 5 109 in the 1950 census is now 16 025 give or take a dozen says the clerk at the town hall.
The old stone Lopez de Arriortua home has gone and the orchard between it and the river has become a car park and market.
The town though run by moderate nationalists is also a significant centre of support for the Basque separatist terrorist group Eta.
Mr Jon Idigoras leader of Herri Batasuna the political party that supports Eta drinks regularly in a local bar.
Eta has a different way of looking at the benefits that business can bring to a town.
they are currently holding one businessman in an effort to raise finance for their war against Madrid.
Mr Idigoras says the kidnapping is a private affair between Eta and the hostage s family.
Even heroes like Mr Lopez step carefully around the extremists of Eta.
If he was mildly popular as a boy Josein whose speech impediment prompted his nickname of el Tarta from the word for to stammer has now become a legend.
Everyone seems to have known him though the picture that emerges of him is fuzzy.
At a photographic studio a lady kindly tore a picture of the house he grew up in from an old album and sold it to me for Pta500.
asks a group of men in a bar sure we know him.
They say he was a terrible football player and although he lived next door to one of the Basque Country s most famous sportsmen he never developed much ball sense.
He was always clumsy always blinking says one.
He was apparently never naughty and is remembered most for doing his homework and for his enjoyment of cutting grass with a scythe.
I sometimes wonder whether he had a childhood at all says one former friend.
We would go off and steal apples and he would go home and study.
Superlopez a fulsome biography just published says he was reading at two and was a budding engineer at six.
The smartest boy in his class he spied on his sister and her suitor (now his brother in law) and was ferociously religious.
His close aides today are practising Catholics.
He holds to a rigid diet never drinks has never smoked and had led a sheltered life before he met his wife at a local hop.
The book the press coverage and young Josein s own gift for self publicity have worked on the town in subtle ways.
People take visiting foreign correspondents and television cameras in their stride and the powers of their hero grow with every telling of his story.
No one for instance believes he stole anything from General Motors.
No cry three impatient people queueing at the town hall as the clerk answers questions about Mr Lopez for the umpteenth time to a visiting journalist.
I doubt it says the man selling copies of the biography at his corner bookshop.
Josein could come back here tomorrow and be taken to its bosom.
Locals say he never got too big for his boots so they would have him back.
The Basques would probably make him minister of industry.
He has a nice house on the Guernica road and a boat in Santander.
He has clearly been plotting his way back to Amorebieta ever since he left in the mid 1960s.
There he can talk in the only language he speaks properly Basque.
The car plant was supposed to be his way of coming home.
A guide from the town sweeps a hand over the rolling countryside where the plant would be built.
The only people still laughing here are the ones living on the site he says.
They ve already been paid inflated prices and they re getting to stay on for free.
If Josein can t bring his car factory we hear they re thinking of building a prison here.
FT 24 AUG 93 VW pushes Bonn on row.
VOLKSWAGEN chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech yesterday stepped up his attempt to draw the Bonn government into the group s clash with Adam Opel General Motors German subsidiary.
He is understood to have telephoned Mr Gunter Rexrodt economics minister for a continuation of face to face talks held in Berlin last Friday.
Although the contents of last week s meetings were secret the minister met Mr David Herman Opel chairman on Tuesday Mr Rexrodt said at the weekend he was optimistic he could tone down the war of words.
He appears to have accepted the role of mediator despite his initial claims that that he wanted only to gather information.
While there are clear dangers for a politician becoming involved in a potentially explosive legal issue Mr Rexrodt is anxious that the inter company conflict does not blow up into a clash between Washington and Bonn.
The minister s optimism suggests Mr Piech and his colleagues are prepared at a price to apologise publicly for charges that Opel was acting as agent provocateur in a US inspired war against its domestic rival and suggestions that it could have planted evidence with the aim of incriminating its employees.
In return Mr Piech is expected to demand that Opel officials stop all press communications on their suspicions and also call a halt to the current criminal investigations against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua the VW production director and three of his associates.
VW stopped commenting on the theft and industrial espionage probe more than a week ago when it refused even to deny new media allegations that 11 of its employees transferred confidential Opel data in Volkswagen computers.
General Motors officials have persistently refused to talk peacefully while VW failed to withdraw its charges stressing that their legal complaints had made no mention of VW itself.
FT 27 AUG 93 VW and the Lopez espionage affair.
Peace plea fails to catch the mood Rexrodt is caught up in an inter family squabble he believes has gone too far The Minister.
The raids yesterday by German police and prosecutors on Volkswagen s headquarters and other facilities in Wolfsburg marked an extraordinary day in the history of the German car industry.
Officials in Bonn did not hide their concern over the potential political and economic damage which could ensue from the battle between two great German car companies.
Christopher Parkes examines the personalities and issues in what one German judge said could be potentially the biggest ever case of industrial espionage.
MR Gunter Rexrodt the German economics minister was due to have a parental chat with Mr David Herman Opel chairman at Frankfurt airport last night.
At the end of a day of extraordinary events at Volkswagen headquarters he was seeking as he has for the past week to defuse the clash between Mr Herman and Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman.
We say it is unique for two great German motor companies to be fighting like this in public the minister s spokesman said yesterday.
He concluded we must do something because it seems in this case that there is such human friction we must bring people to more reason.
It was the minister s job to try to prevent damage to political and business relations between the US and Germany his spokesman added.
It has been suggested for some weeks by lowlier politicians and business leaders that the clash over the alleged theft of Opel data and suspected industrial espionage could well cause the sort of damage Mr Rexrodt now fears.
But it was only a week ago after a call from Mr Piech that the minister acted.
His attitude appears to be that there is a inter family squabble going on and his job is to shut the quarrelsome children in separate rooms and try quietly to talk some sense into the parents.
Opel has said it will be prepared to exchange letters with VW provided public apologies are forthcoming from the other side.
It wants a withdrawal of remarks suggesting that the US owned company is spearheading an American campaign to undermine the German motor industry and that it planted evidence prejudicial to criminal investigations.
But while the probe continues at its heated pace tempers are hardly likely to be cool enough for a reasonable let alone a useful exchange between the two sides.
Nor is Opel which appears so far to have the best hand likely to want to be seen talking publicly.
Any rapprochement could be interpreted as a sign of weakness.
The three way contacts supposed to be held in secret have been routinely followed by heartening press releases from Mr Otto Wachs a Volkswagen spokesman.
Nor has Opel been pleased by statements attributed to Mr Rexrodt to the effect that he wanted the case settled in the civil courts.
While the minister probably appreciates that the criminal case is entirely out of Opel s VW s and political hands his initiative came late in the day.
That it followed Mr Piech s widely criticised insinuations against Opel which were in turn followed by an abortive attempt by the VW chief to open peace talks could leave Mr Rexrodt open to suggestions that he may not be acting altogether with the common good in mind.
Opel which has stuck rigorously to its claim that it has reasonable grounds for suspicion confirmed by public prosecutors might reasonably ask why no political initiatives or support were forthcoming when it first declared itself the injured party.
The substance of its suspicions is that former employees decamped to VW in possession of virtually all its business strategy for the next 10 years.
A way must be found for them to work together sensibly.
their Asian competitors must be rubbing their hands said Mr Rexrodt s spokesman.
US and European companies should co operate to resist Asian dumping.
There is already common ground between Mr Herman and Mr Piech.
Neither needs reminding of the Japanese threat and both know that at some stage the bridges between their two groups must be rebuilt.
But the best time is probably when the full extent of the local damage has been assessed and last night seemed hardly suitable.
FT 27 AUG 93 Police raid VW head offices.
Homes of ex GM executives searched in probe into alleged espionage.
MORE than 60 police and criminal investigators yesterday raided Volkswagen s head offices and the homes of several VW executives to search for secret data allegedly stolen from Adam Opel the General Motors German subsidiary.
30am search squads simultaneously entered eight separate locations in and around Wolfsburg in the most dramatic move yet in the four month old investigation into allegations of industrial espionage against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua VW s production director and three colleagues.
The residences of the four men all of whom abruptly joined VW from the US group last March are understood to have been among the targets.
Also searched was the VW management institute in Braunschweig close to the company headquarters in Wolfsburg and the group s official guesthouse.
Around 20 public prosecution officials an unknown number of officers from the federal criminal bureau and 40 police from three municipal forces are believed to have taken part.
30pm but officers were due to return this morning a VW spokesman said.
The raid is the most significant development made known publicly since confirmation in mid July that secret Opel documents some allegedly assembled at Mr Lopez s instructions had been found in the former home of two of his associates.
Speculation grew yesterday that Mr Lopez might be forced to quit.
In a newspaper interview yesterday Mr Klaus Liesen head of the group s supervisory board backed away from former statements implying unconditional backing for Mr Lopez.
Yesterday s search comes at a delicate moment in efforts by Mr Gunter Rexrodt German economics minister to broker peace talks between Mr Ferdinand Piech VW group chairman and Mr David Herman Opel chairman.
The minister was due to meet Mr Herman at Frankfurt airport last night when he was expected to present the Opel chief with a draft public apology from Mr Piech for insinuations made by the VW head and colleagues against the GM group.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn Mr Rexrodt s spokesman said yesterday the government had no interest in the legal issues but we must think beyond the immediate situation to the longer term.
The minister was worried because of potential damage to relations between the US and Germany.
A way must be found for them to work together sensibly.
Asian competitors must be rubbing their hands Mr Wauschkuhn added.
Mr Liesen appeared relaxed and well rehearsed as the raid took place.
Several of the VW public relations team calmly repeated they had been expecting a search and welcomed it as a step likely to end the speculation about Mr Lopez.
Mr Piech was out of the plant at the time of the raid rumours about which had circulated for almost two weeks.
Mr Georg Nauth spokesman for the Darmstadt public prosecutors office in charge of the criminal investigation said time had been needed to question witnesses and examine further evidence to pinpoint the data to be looked for and the most likely places for it to be found.
It was unlikely that statements would be issued immediately on any possible evidence uncovered he said.
Mr Nauth added that as well as interrogating junior VW employees who allegedly fed Opel data into the VW data base the prosecutor in charge of the case Ms Dorothea Holland had also questioned Mr Carl Hahn former VW chairman.
Mr Lopez and his associates had not yet been interviewed.
We assume the investigating authorities do not take such action without having strong reasons to do so.

FT 04 SEP 93 Prosecutors to question VW chairman.
CRIMINAL investigators probing the suspected theft of General Motors industrial secrets by Volkswagen executives plan to question Mr Ferdinand Piech group chairman.
He and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua the company s production director at the centre of the investigation would be interrogated as sure as they say amen in church the Darmstadt prosecutors office said yesterday.
But legal officials would first have to complete their examination of a haul of documents and computerised information seized from the vehicle group s Wolfsburg headquarters in a raid on August 26.
The office recently suggested Mr Piech would not be called because a spokesman said he is not a suspect.
An interim report on a private probe within VW presented to the group s supervisory board yesterday contained no findings to warrant industrial espionage accusations the company said in a statement last night.
Officials said after an all day meeting of the board that Mr Piech and Mr Lopez would not be leaving.
The investigations involving Mr Lopez and three associates who left the General Motors group in March are primarily concerned with suspicions of the systematic theft of secrets from Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary.
The supervisory board which appoints and oversees the work of executive directors was also told yesterday that group profits in 1993 could be adversely affected by poor performances at the Seat subsidiary in Spain and in north American and Asian Pacific markets.
However the German parent and the group would show a profit in the third quarter after a DM1.
The statement issued after the board session once again showed signs of a retreat from earlier declarations that the company would break even or return to profit this year and that Mr Lopez would remain until he had been found guilty.
The supervisory board also reinstated Mr Ulrich Seiffert as main board research and development director with immediate effect.
He was removed in mid March on the same day Mr Lopez was appointed.
The VW supervisory board which appointed auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand on August 13 to carry out an independent probe said yesterday it expected a full report by the end of October.
VW is accused of paying lip service to probe.
VOLKSWAGEN should start to co operate fully with the investigation by public prosecutors of the alleged theft of secret documents from General Motors and not just pay lip service to co operation Mr Louis Hughes president of GM Europe said at the Frankfurt motor show yesterday.
I wish that the Volkswagen group instead of saying they would fully co operate with the public prosecutors would actually do so.
If charges were made it would be a case of industrial espionage of unbelievable proportions Mr Hughes said.
VW said yesterday it was co operating fully with the state prosecutors and that Mr Hughes remarks were unjust.
It was in VW s interest that the matter be cleared up as quickly as possible said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs VW spokesman.
The prosecutors have been investigating for more than four months the alleged theft of thousands of confidential documents from General Motors the US carmaker and from Opel its German subsidiary in connection with the defection to Volkswagen in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua GM s former global purchasing director along with several of his former GM colleagues.
Mr Lopez is now the VW group s production and purchasing director.
The prosecutors raided VW s head office in Wolfsburg and several other locations late last month.
The alleged theft concerns the disappearance of highly sensitive GM documents which the US group says are vital to its competitive standing including the prices it pays suppliers for components lists of its components suppliers and confidential details of its future product programmes stretching through the 1990s.
It would be good if Mr Piech (VW chief executive) and Mr (Klaus) Liesen (chairman of the VW supervisory board) would send a letter to VW employees saying that without any danger to their job security or their relationship with their supervisors they should say what they know of this case.
FT 15 SEP 93 Rexrodt abandons peace role in Volkswagen row with GM.
MR Gunter Rexrodt German economics minister has unexpectedly abandoned his role as peacemaker between motor industry rivals Volkswagen and Adam Opel the German subsidiary of General Motors.
He was being kept informed on the bitter dispute over the alleged theft of data and possible industrial espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua the new VW production director.
But the minister was no longer active a spokeswoman said yesterday.
Nothing has changed and when there is no willingness then it is just a waste of time she added.
It is understood there are no plans for any further contacts with either side.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn Mr Rexrodt s personal spokesman said recently that the minister s aim had been to try to prevent damage to political and business relations between the US and Germany and to find a way for the two companies to work together sensibly.
Political observers said yesterday that by leaving the legal investigation and the row to run their natural courses Mr Rexrodt has withdrawn from an fast moving unpredictable situation in which he was ill advised to intervene in the first place.
He was drawn into the fray by Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman after Opel said it would agree to written exchanges with the VW chief if he publicly retracted statements that the US group was conducting a war with the intention of defaming Volkswagen.
However Mr Piech was prepared only to offer not to repeat his accusations.
The minister last met Mr David Herman Opel chairman on August 26 in Frankfurt the same day public prosecutors raided and searched VW headquarters and the homes of Mr Lopez and seven of his colleagues.
FT 26 OCT 93 Germany and US to link up in VW probe.
THE WAY has been cleared for US and German criminal authorities to exchange evidence gathered in their parallel investigations of alleged theft and industrial espionage by Volkswagen executives.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has been granted access to German public prosecutors files and it is understood that FBI data may be made available to Ms Dorothea Holland head of the German probe.
The link is the first significant development in the case involving VW production director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and several associates all former General Motors employees since Ms Holland led a raid on VW s headquarters in August.
Mr Lopez and his colleagues are suspected of systematically collecting vast quantities of industrial data while employed at GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel.
He has admitted having ordered the destruction of possibly sensitive GM material at VW.
The German authorities granted the FBI access to Ms Holland s findings after top level negotiations between Washington and Bonn and the Hesse regional government.
Mr Georg Nauth for the Darmstadt prosecutors office confirmed the move yesterday.
Ms Holland was still sifting data from 25 computers and 250 diskettes seized in the VW raid in an enormously complex exercise Mr Nauth added.
While the German investigation has slowed the US probe has gained momentum with the summoning of a grand jury which will decide whether the evidence justifies indictment.
The FBI has had access to all General Motors material and affidavits involved in the case and is also believed to have questioned officials from Volkswagen of America VW s US subsidiary.
Possible charges against Mr Lopez his colleagues and the company include wire or mail fraud which carry possible penalties of imprisonment or fines.
US law prohibits the use of postal or telecommunications services for illegal purposes which include violations of obligations of loyal and fruitful service to an employer.
FT 10 NOV 93 VW may bar managers in compromise with Opel.
SEVERAL top Volkswagen managers may be ordered temporarily to stop work if a compromise reached yesterday between lawyers representing the German automotive group and rival Adam Opel is approved by the two companies boards later this week.
Prospects of a deal which could end one of the legal battles between the groups emerged after private negotiations in the back room of a Frankfurt court.
An open court hearing called to consider an appeal from Opel the General Motors subsidiary that seven former GM group employees should be banned from working at VW for a year was adjourned after Mr Heinz Traub the presiding judge recommended that the two sides should look for a compromise.
An earlier attempt by Opel to win a temporary banning injunction was turned down because the court decided the seven had been drawn to VW by the charisma of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua a former senior GM executive who defected to Volkswagen in March.
However further evidence has since emerged to strengthen Opel s claim that VW systematically poached key GM group employees mainly production and purchasing executives.
According to sworn statements Mr Lopez personally approached about 17 people.
Volkswagen is still bound by a separate injunction not to continue this practice.
Closing yesterday s proceedings Mr Traub said both companies had already been damaged by the affair.
Under orders from the judge to keep strictly silent or risk endangering the outcome neither company would discuss yesterday s deal.
However three or four of the seven possibly including Mr Jorge Manuel Gutierrez head of VW production and Mr Lopez s closest colleague may be suspended from their normal work if the companies boards approve the compromise before the end of this week a deadline set by Mr Traub.
Agreement to such a compromise is likely to be seen as acknowledgment by VW that it was at least partly at fault.
Rejection will result in a full open court hearing next month at which Mr Lopez could be called to give evidence.
He spent yesterday waiting in an hotel near the court but was not summoned.
Criminal investigations are continuing into suspicions that he Mr Gutierrez and a further two of the seven people involved in yesterday s hearing stole secret GM data before leaving for VW.
A probe into possible perjury by Mr Lopez is also under way.
FT 05 JAN 94 Opel airs more VW evidence.
Fresh evidence on the events surrounding the controversial defection of General Motors executives to Volkswagen last March is expected to be aired in a Frankfurt court today.
The civil hearing represents a renewed attempt by Adam Opel the US group s German subsidiary to have seven former GM employees suspended from their present jobs at VW on the grounds that Volkswagen used anti competitive methods to lure them away.
Opel lawyers are likely to try to support their case with hitherto confidential information in the files of criminal prosecutors investigating allegations of theft of documents and industrial espionage against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three of those who followed him to VW.
Two previous attempts to have the men suspended failed in summary hearings at which no evidence was heard in public.
One bid to win a temporary injunction early last year was rejected on the grounds that Mr Lopez s charisma had drawn his seven colleagues in his wake.
An appeal against that ruling failed on a technicality last month.
Mr Horst Borghs an Opel board member said at the time he expected a different result after today s hearing.
Although the criminal investigation and today s civil case are formally separate issues both revolve around GM s fundamental claims of concerted attempts to undermine its German business.
Opel also appears intent on pursuing all legal avenues partly to keep the issues in the public eye until the completion of criminal investigations started in Germany last May and in the US during July.
The German probe is bogged down by a meticulous investigation of computerised data seized last summer in a raid on VW headquarters and the homes of Mr Lopez and his colleagues.
Opel won the first significant round in the protracted controversy last April when a court barred VW from any further attempts systematically to poach GM staff.
Opel had sought the temporary injunction on the grounds that approaches to some 40 staff constituted an attempt to damage its business.
In that case Opel presented affidavits from around 20 senior employees mainly in key component purchasing and production departments who said they had been approached by Mr Lopez and others.
Some were allegedly offered double their salaries to change sides.
FT 03 FEB 94 VW poaching of GM staff did not break rules court declares.
A Frankfurt civil court yesterday rejected claims that Volkswagen broke competition rules in poaching seven managers from the General Motors group and trying to lure away a further 22 last spring.
VW greeted the judgment as a crucial victory in its long running dispute with GM over the recruitment of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua the US group s former global purchasing chief and his associates who followed him to VW.
Criminal investigations in Germany and the US relating to suspected industrial espionage theft perjury and wire fraud are still in progress.
However the court said in a written statement that it was a matter for debate whether allegations of the theft of GM secrets were justifiable.
Mr Jurgen Kicker the lawyer representing Volkswagen said the ruling exonerated Mr Lopez and the German group from all suspicions against them.
that no one has stolen any trade secrets and no one has used any.
He said he did not think the current criminal investigations would come to any other conclusion than that reached yesterday.
Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs VW group spokesman said.
The state prosecutors will have to think twice now before bringing any charges.
But a spokesman for Mr Klaus Liesen chairman of VW s supervisory board who is responsible for the board s conduct stressed that the ruling resolved only the issue of anti competitive staff poaching.
Unlike Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman Mr Liesen has consistently refused to give Mr Lopez or his followers unconditional support.
Officials at Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary stressed that the evidence available to the Frankfurt court was more limited than that gathered by public prosecutors it included only information from GM s files.
Evidence and statements gathered by the prosecutors since then were not examined by the Frankfurt civil court they said.
VW has admitted that some of Mr Lopez s team were involved in shredding possibly sensitive material last March in the group s Wolfsburg guest house.
Prosecutors who have also investigated at least two further instances in which material has been destroyed are examining a computerised data seized during a raid on VW headquarters and employees homes last August.
A court statement said it had not ignored the unusual circumstances in which all seven suddenly left and were almost immediately installed in new jobs at VW but its decision was based on the former GM employees evidence that they had approached Mr Lopez voluntarily.
Opel officials said yesterday s judgment was a sideshow to the main event.
The company regretted the decision and would examine the ruling before it decided whether to appeal.
FT 04 FEB 94 Audi chief expected to be forced out.
The chairman of Volkswagen s up market Audi subsidiary Mr Franz Josef Kortum is expected to be forced to resign today after only 13 months in the job.
The 43 year old marketing specialist has clashed on several occasions with his predecessor Mr Ferdinand Piech the controversial VW group chairman.
His place is expected to be filled by Mr Herbert Demel development chief who will act as spokesman for the Audi board but not as chairman.
This is likely to lead to more direct control by Mr Piech.
Mr Kortum s removal may also lead to further turmoil in the VW group already racked by unexpected losses last year of DM2.
3bn (Pounds 870m) and striving to reach break even in 1994.
Meanwhile suspicions of theft and industrial espionage in the wake of the appointment of General Motors former global purchasing chief Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua who joined last March remain.
Mr Kortum s first set to with Mr Piech occurred before his appointment when he rejected the spokesman role and insisted on taking full control.
The conflict leading to his downfall has focused on the autocratic group chairman s demands that Audi which made a pre tax loss of more than DM200m in 1993 must be turned round this year.
Mr Kortum has frequently appeared unwilling to bend to his chief who has swept away swathes of the old VW management within his first year.
The most recent departure was that of Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez chairman of the Spanish subsidiary Seat who was sacked last September.
FT 05 APR 94 VW rejects fresh claims against Lopez.
Volkswagen has again been put on the defensive by reports of impending legal action for perjury against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua group production director.
The German motor group dismissed as highly speculative a weekend report in the news magazine Der Spiegel that Mr Lopez faced a charge of making false sworn statements in a court action last year.
Meanwhile it is believed that a separate German investigation into allegations that Mr Lopez and three colleagues stole General Motors industrial secrets before defecting to VW a year ago has been widened to include other former GM workers.
Until recently only Mr Lopez and three of the seven close colleagues who joined him at VW all from the US group had been under suspicion.
According to Der Spiegel the Hamburg prosecution service has told Mr Lopez s lawyers that if they do not present a defence it will shortly seek a judgment on the perjury allegation based on evidence on file.
Legal experts said this indicated that the prosecutor was confident of winning a prosecution.
German penalties for perjury range from a fine to imprisonment.
The magazine based its report on statements attributed to Mr Andreas Behm the Hamburg state prosecutor although VW said it stemmed from comments from GM lawyers.
Mr Lopez s lawyers had spoken to Mr Behm and still expected no charges the German group said in a weekend statement.
Suspicions of perjury against Mr Lopez arose last year in a civil action in which VW failed to win a gagging order intended to prevent Der Spiegel repeating allegations of industrial espionage which lie at the heart of continuing criminal investigations in Germany and the US.
Central to the magazine s latest report is an affidavit dated last June in which Mr Lopez said he neither asked for nor received photographs of a secret new model planned by Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary shortly before he left to join VW.
He contradicted this four months later in another affidavit presented in a separate civil hearing.
VW s weekend statement reiterated that the company remained convinced that no GM data had come into its possession or was used to its benefit.
A German criminal probe against Mr Lopez based on allegations of misconduct embezzlement and breaches of competition law has been under way since last spring.
Investigators have made no formal statements since late last summer when they seized masses of computerised data in raids on VW s headquarters and the homes of its new employees from GM.
The recent widening of the investigation is believed to be related to information found among these data.
A federal inquiry in the US started last summer is also continuing.
The investigation into suspected wire and mail fraud the illegal transmission of data across state boundaries is focused on VW s local subsidiaries.
However at least two main board directors have been questioned before a grand jury.
FT 27 APR 94 VW espionage case widens.
The discovery of fresh evidence and the investigation of new suspects in the long running Volkswagen General Motors industrial espionage case are expected to be announced by German state prosecutors today.
Mr Volkmar Kallenbach spokesman for Darmstadt criminal investigators said today s report on the case would deal with new findings and the scope of the investigation.
However Mr Kallenbach yesterday denied reports that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua VW s production director would soon face charges.
Furthermore he would neither confirm nor deny German media reports that plans for a revolutionary new VW car factory had been found to be virtually identical to a similar secret project on which Mr Lopez worked while at GM.
The probe which started last spring into allegations that Mr Lopez and three former colleagues from the US group took industrial secrets with them when they abruptly joined VW last March is still far from complete and legal experts said today s statement was unlikely to contain many details since the prosecutors had to be careful to avoid prejudice in the event of future charges and trial.
FT 28 APR 94 Opel plan strikingly similar to VW idea.
Plant X the root of all the trouble between Volkswagen and General Motors has re emerged at the centre of a criminal investigation into suspicions that the US group s former global purchasing chief stole GM secrets before his move to the German company just over a year ago.
As German prosecutors announced yesterday there were striking similarities between GM s secret Plant X a shelved project to build a super efficient car factory in Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua s native Basque country and VW s own version Plant B.
The similarities were detected during the painstaking sifting of data seized last August in a search of Volkswagen s headquarters and the homes of Mr Lopez and seven colleagues who fled with him from GM to VW.
Data on plant B was found in Mr Lopez s office prosecutors said.
While still employed by GM Mr Lopez worked as project leader on Plant X.
He had a site all ready for the revolutionary new works my dream as he liked to call it.
It was the shattering of this dream with the discovery that the project was not to go ahead at least not in Mr Lopez s home town which led to his bitter and controversial desertion.
Shortly after his move as charges and counter charges flew about his head Mr Lopez was to learn that VW was not to go ahead either.
But while the plant represented Mr Lopez s dream it could in no way be considered his property.
Investigations will continue details will be checked and cross checked to discover how closely the two projects match one another.
The aim will be to determine if VW s project was copied from GM data essential if industrial espionage is to be proved.
The likelihood of more than passing similarities being found appeared to be increased by other discoveries announced by the prosecutors office yesterday.
These included diskettes and other material which were suspected of being sourced or copied from documents belonging to Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary.
Another important find was a diskette in Mr Lopez s personal environment crammed with data on cost saving programmes for GM cars.
Although a seemingly meagre harvest from almost eight months gleaning through the 2m plus sheets of paper seized in last August s raids the discoveries clearly nullify recent speculation that the chief investigator Ms Dorothea Holland has reached the end of her tether and is about to fold the whole investigation.
It will last for several months yet according to her spokesman and there is no sign yet of whether it will result in charges either in Germany or the US where a federal grand jury is investigating.
In the interests of preparedness VW appears to have a defence ready and based on the claim that GM has an exagerated sense of what is secret.
KPMG consultants called in after the VW raid last year found some GM and Opel data and declared the lot non confidential.
Yesterday s revelations followed last year s find of secret data on Opel s sub compact O car in a house previously occupied by two of Mr Lopez s closest lieutenants and admissions from VW that large quantities of possibly sensitive data was shredded on its premises.
FT 30 APR 94 Lopez daughter named as VW spy case suspect.
The daughter of the prime suspect in the VW General Motors industrial espionage investigation was the original source of some of the new potential evidence turned up recently by German state prosecutors it emerged yesterday.
A diskette containing data on cost reduction planning at GM the existence of which was made public by the German authorities this week was compiled by Ms Begounia Lopez daughter of the US group s former purchasing director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
Mr Lopez has told his current employer Volkswagen that his daughter now 22 gathered the information for a student thesis while on a work study placement with GM shortly before his abrupt departure for VW in March 1993.
Ms Lopez is known to have been temporarily employed in the Chevrolet marketing department during the relevant period.
Officials close to the affair said that after a complaint from GM lawyers Ms Lopez was now being treated formally by investigators as a suspect along with her father and three of his closest associates.
All former GM employees they followed him to VW within days of his leaving the US.
Mr Lopez s lawyers last night dismissed the suspicions as groundless.
They claimed the diskette found in Ms Lopez s room contained material she gathered while studying at the independent General Motors Institute.
The US group has consistently claimed that it was a victim of a systematic intelligence gathering campaign instigated by Mr Lopez in preparation for his defection.
Details of a secret sub compact car supposedly restricted to top level GM management were found in a Wiesbaden house last summer shortly after it was vacated by two of Mr Lopez s close but junior associates.
Meanwhile it also emerged that a US Justice Department official interviewed Mr Klaus Liesen chairman of the VW supervisory board in London on Thursday.
The interview suggests the US grand jury probe into suspected wire and mail fraud by the VW group Mr Lopez and others is being focused more on Germany.
FT 05 MAY 94 Lopez to pay DM75 000 to end perjury case.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua the beleaguered production director of Volkswagen will pay an agreed sum of DM75 000 (Pounds 29 850) instead of facing perjury charges in court it emerged yesterday.
Mr Lopez still maintained his innocence and had wanted a full hearing on the issue his lawyers said.
However he gave up this right and agreed to the closure of the case to avoid further stress from these proceedings and in the interests of the company.
The deal ended speculation that Mr Lopez subject of continuing investigations for suspected industrial espionage might shortly face his first public questioning under oath in the long running battle between VW and General Motors of the US Mr Lopez s former employer.
Adam Opel GM s German subsidiary welcomed yesterday s decision even though Mr Lopez had been neither tried nor judged.
Mr Lopez remains under investigation in Germany and the US for suspected crimes against GM and alleged breaches of federal mail and telecommunications law.
A muted statement from the VW supervisory board said it was pleased the case had been closed and that Lopez had subjugated his personal interest in a continuation of the proceedings and an acquittal in the interests of his board responsibilities.
The case concerned suspected false affidavits presented in a Hamburg court last year about press articles over suspected industrial espionage by Mr Lopez and three associates.
One sworn statement to the effect that he had never asked for nor received photographs of a projected new car to be made by Opel GM s German subsidiary was directly contradicted in a later affidavit from Mr Lopez.
Another sworn denial that he was the author of a controversial speech was strongly countered by verbal and material evidence in open court from a former GM associate.
The Hamburg prosecuting authorities said yesterday that these two points gave grounds for sufficient suspicions that Mr Lopez had made negligent false or incomplete statements.
Although it appeared negligence had played a significant role the prosecutors were not able to close the case on the grounds that all suspicions had been cleared.
Yesterday s decision prejudiced neither the special characteristics of the subject matter of the investigation nor the associated considerable public interest they said.
FT 20 MAY 94 GM and VW resume skirmishing.
The legal struggle between Volkswagen and General Motors blew up yesterday into a head on confrontation involving senior executives politicians and legal officials.
Mr David Herman head of GM s local operations accused Mr Gerhard Schroder prime minister of Lower Saxony and a member of the VW supervisory board of trying to use his political weight to influence the investigations by state prosecutors in Hesse into claims of industrial espionage against GM.
The case is based on suspicions that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and close associates collected secret data while working for the US group taking it with them when they moved to VW last March.
Mr Herman said GM s Adam Opel subsidiary would resist all insinuations slander cover up attempts and other defamatory plans.
Mr Schroder later repeated his suggestions which sparked Mr Herman s attack that the probe should be stopped.
Mr Ferdinand Piech VW chairman said he wanted an independent assessor to examine the conduct of the case.
Yesterday s outbursts were sparked by a sequence of related events culminating in a television programme on Wednesday night which suggested that evidence might have been planted and that private detectives used by Opel s lawyers had used subterfuge in the hunt for evidence.
Lawyers representing Mr Lopez now VW s production chief and his colleagues had earlier implied that the official investigation might be biased and impaired by evidence possibly obtained by subterfuge.
However Mr Hans Christoph Schaefer attorney for the state of Hesse said there was not the slightest reason to doubt the objectivity or neutrality of his investigators.
Contrary to suggestions from VW lawyers he said the official investigators knew private detectives had been appointed.
Their findings were in the files clearly marked as coming from outside sources and accessible to VW legal representatives.
Such information would obviously undergo a critical examination Mr Schaefer added.
If it turned out that illegal methods had been used to gather the information that would bring its value into question and possible criminal offences would be investigated.
Volkswagen was told yesterday that the Spanish government would not inject funds into Seat the group s ailing Spanish subsidiary but that it was prepared to help the restructuring programme initiated by the Barcelona based auto producer through complementary measures.
The firm stance against any bail out for Seat was delivered to VW chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech during talks with the Spanish prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez.
Specific help to Seat could involve credits to help finance a Pta50bn (Pounds 241m) early retirement scheme.
FT 10 JUN 94 Bonn warned by US over VW spy case.
The Volkswagen General Motors industrial espionage case couldharm relations between the US and Germany if the Justice Department does not receive help soon from German investigators Mr Ron Brown commerce secretary suggested yesterday.
There was no evidence of any danger to political or other business relations at present but I think it has the potential he said in Bonn.
The risk depended on the responsiveness of the German authorities to inquiries from the Justice Department and how quickly the information flows he added.
His remarks were the first public indication of irritation in the US administration over the Hesse Justice Ministry s reluctance to provide concrete help to the US authorities.
It is believed US investigators have asked for but have been so far refused access to evidence accumulated by German prosecutors probing allegations that former GM director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole industrial secrets from the US group and took them with him when he joined VW last year.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation started an independent probe of the circumstances shortly after the White House made plain that President Bill Clinton considered industrial espionage a particular threat to US economic interests.
Until yesterday Justice Department and other US government officials have consistently refused to comment on their investigation which is believed to be based on suspicions that GM corporate property was moved illegally across state boundaries in contravention of federal mail and telecommunications laws.
Mr Brown who met Mr Gunter Rexrodt the Bonn economics minister in Paris on Wednesday was speaking after meeting US and German business and political officials.
Mr David Herman Opel chairman GM s German subsidiary was among the guests.
Mr Rexrodt was briefly embroiled in the case last year when he was unwillingly drawn into the fray as a potential mediator between the two vehicle groups.
German investigators came under heavy political fire recently when Mr Gerhard Schroder prime minister of VW s home state Lower Saxony called for the case to be closed.
He suggested the investigation was biased and based partly on evidence acquired by private detectives hired by Opel lawyers who used deceptive methods.
His charges were promptly rejected by the most senior prosecuting official in Opel s base Hesse who also imposed a news black out on the probe.

Ever more complex transatlantic tussle The industrial espionage battle between Volkswagen and General Motors.
The scene of the industrial espionage battle between Volkswagen and General Motors has moved from the high ground and the newspaper headlines into the legal quicksands.
Investigations of the circumstances surrounding the defection to VW of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua the US group s global purchasing supremo in March last year have become bogged down in mountains of paper in Germany and enmeshed in an ever more complex transatlantic tussle involving lawyers and politicians.
But GM remains convinced that the probe into what a German judge described as potentially the biggest ever case of industrial espionage will eventually show that at the time VW recruited Mr Lopez along with seven of his closest associates from Detroit and the group s German subsidiary Adam Opel it also gained access to vast volumes of General Motors confidential data.
Staff poaching and charges of dirty dealing are common enough in the world of international business but the intensity of GM s attack on Europe s biggest volume carmaker and the scale of the allegations it has made have yet to be matched in the motor trade.
The basic charges are that at the same time as Mr Lopez was negotiating his terms at VW (and consistently denying that he was about to leave GM) he and his associates were systematically looting Adam Opel s industrial secrets.
These included details of Opel s entire European component supplier network and key contract data especially prices.
plans for a new style low cost high speed car factory and information on new models.
Mr Lopez has consistently denied any wrong doing and has got on with his new job.
Formerly renowned within GM for squeezing price concessions out of component suppliers he was charged by his new boss VW chairman Ferdinand Piech with a leading role in helping the German group claw back a 30 per cent production cost disadvantage in relation to French and Japanese competitors.
Now while VW races to reach the promised break even point this year after last time s DM2.
3bn loss a German criminal investigation launched in May 1993 after GM aired its initial suspicions at the public prosecutor s office in Darmstadt is gnawing snail fashion at a mountain of paper and electronic data.
Dorothea Holland until four months ago the only prosecuting lawyer on the German case assembled this mountain officially estimated as equivalent to about 2m computer print out sheets during one of the more spectacular phases of the probe in a raid on VW s headquarters in August last year.
Now reinforced by at least one other prosecutor she and her team have disappeared into the pile of paper.
Following a steady flow of leaks and statements on apparently incriminating discoveries her office has been gagged by senior legal authorities.
No further announcements will be made until a decision has been reached on whether there is evidence enough to indict Mr Lopez and or his associates.
Until the gag was imposed Ms Holland had appeared to be making substantial progress.
According to her office boxes which were discovered early in the investigation in the former home of two of Mr Lopez s colleagues were found to contain some of the allegedly confidential documents which GM claimed had disappeared at the time of Mr Lopez s leaving.
These included plans for the 0 Car a mini style vehicle designed for the hard fought European market and detailed price information.
According to eye witness reports which to date have not been challenged by VW the apartment s former occupants now employed by the German group had earlier been observed shredding large quantities of documents with two machines.
By VW s own admission shredders were also used in its corporate guest house in Wolfsburg to destroy papers and other materials which arrived there almost immediately after Mr Lopez s appointment to the VW board.
According to VW s statements the possibly sensitive material was shredded to prevent its circulating within the VW group.
In late April this year just before the flow of progress reports dried up Ms Holland s office reported that the haul from her VW raid had been found to include plans for a revolutionary car factory known as Plant B within VW which showed striking similarities to Opel s Plant X.
It also emerged that further GM data was discovered on a computer diskette that had been compiled by one of Mr Lopez s daughters.
Meanwhile a US probe started at the instigation of the Commerce Department in Washington is stuck at the German border in a hither and thither exchange involving local and federal governments the Darmstadt diggers and VW s and GM s legal advisers.
This investigation which was launched after US President Bill Clinton apparently decided that industrial espionage in general was a threat to his nation s well being is in principle a far more simple or at least more single minded pursuit than that of Ms Holland.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing possible mail and wire fraud.
In effect if GM data is found to have been posted or transmitted across state or federal boundaries without the knowledge or permission of its owner then those responsible the recipient or its agents may be liable to criminal prosecution and huge fines.
After months of toing and froing the Bonn justice ministry recently agreed in principle that the FBI could have access to the evidence gathered in the German investigation.
However since under German law VW has a right to know details of any proposed information exchange and the right to challenge any planned moves in court the scene appears to be set for an extended interlude that will spell yet more frustration for GM and relief for the VW management.
