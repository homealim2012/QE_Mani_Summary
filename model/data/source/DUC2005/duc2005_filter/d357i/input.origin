19920219000000000	FT  19 FEB 92 / UN aims to redraw border of Iraq and Kuwait. KUWAIT looks certain to be given several Iraqi oil wells and part of a naval base as a result of a United Nations border proposal. Western diplomats in Kuwait said Baghdad would be infuriated by the demarcation but there was little Iraq could do beyond complaining. Mutual agreement on the new border 'is just something else which will have to wait until the regime changes in Iraq', one diplomat said. The United Nations Commission, established as part of the Gulf war ceasefire agreement, is not expected to present its findings until April. However, officials say the team has already decided on 'parameters' for the border. These will lie several hundreds - in some cases thousands - of metres north of what has previously been accepted as the border. The demarcation will place in Kuwaiti territory between five and seven oil wells in the Iraqi portion of the Rumalia oilfield. The UN experts have also decided that the point at which the border meets the coast is virtually certain to run through Iraq's main naval base at Umm Qasr. The new border will anger Baghdad for a number of reasons. Iraq revived its disputed claim to the entirety of Kuwait as justification for its August 1990 invasion. Iraq also claimed some southern portions of the Rumalia oilfield, which dips into Kuwait, and had expressed irritation about its limited access to the sea. Umm Qasr has virtually been Iraq's sole serviceable port since the Shatt al Arab waterway was closed in September 1980 by the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's president Saddam Hussein launched the war in part to gain full sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab. The commission's findings have been based on exhaustive research into maps and documents held largely in British Foreign Office archives. These date back as far as the early 1900s, when the modern states of Iraq and Kuwait were shaped out of the crumbling Ottoman empire. Once the decision is announced, the 120-mile (200km) common border will be marked with border posts and will also receive formal UN sanction. Common borders are finally a matter of bilateral consent between neighbouring countries, but US officials say they will insist the new boundary be respected as Iraq's southern border. The present border is monitored by the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, which patrols a demilitarised zone running 10km north of the accepted border and 5km south. Iraqi trespass over this border is considered an infringement of the Gulf ceasefire terms. The UN Security Council yesterday warned Iraq to start co-operating fully with UN weapons inspectors or face grave, though unspecified, consequences, AP reports. The council decided in closed meetings to send Mr Rolf Ekeus, who heads the special commission monitoring elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, to Baghdad at once to demand compliance with UN resolutions. Diplomats say that economic sanctions could be tightened if Iraq does not fall in line. Iraq repeatedly has tried to conceal the extent of its nuclear weapons programmes and other arms projects. It also has refused to co-operate in the long-term monitoring and destruction of arms. Shifting sands, Page 4
19920402000000000	FT  02 APR 92 / Falklands invites oil search tenders. THE FALKLAND ISLANDS gov-ernment is inviting tenders for seismic studies in disputed territorial waters in the South Atlantic, in effect excluding Argentina from the initial search for oil in the area. Senior Falklands government officials have been told by the Foreign Office that further steps towards developing an oil industry in the area  - such as full-scale exploration  - must await agreement between London and Buenos Aires. However, this initial move, coinciding with the tenth anniversary today of the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, could provoke a strong protest from Argentina, which has been pressing for joint participation with the UK on every stage of the Falklands' oil programme. Its timing also appears to have pre-empted the outcome of the UK general election, which Falkland Islanders fear may lead to a Labour victory and a more conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty. Surprised foreign ministry officials in Buenos Aires said they had been reassured by the UK there would be no unilateral move on oil. Argentina wants to participate in the seismic studies, which it considers important in establishing the true economic potential of the area. Argentina, which does not recognise the islands' government, claims sovereignty over the surrounding waters. But the Foreign Office in London said that the Falklands government could, under local legislation, exercise rights over the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf around the islands. There is widespread speculation in the Falklands and in Buenos Aires that the islands have large oil reserves. A study of their oil potential by a private company in the 1970s has remained a closely guarded secret. Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the islands' council, said there was no reason why the Falkland Islands could not go ahead with the studies. He expected seismic studies to be completed by the end of this year and to be in a position to licence blocks for exploration by the middle of 1993. Mr Sampson said local councillors had been 'made aware by the British government' that in the 'longer term there will have to be a much closer co-operation with Argentina in the exploration of oil'. UK-Argentine talks in Buenos Aires in February about oil were inconclusive, but further negotiations are planned for in London in June. The Foreign Office said last night that, given the 'sensitivity' of the oil issue, London and Buenos Aires were remaining in constant contact with each other.
19920611000000000	FT  11 JUN 92 / Compromise over islands. AN international court of arbitration yesterday ended a 25-year-old dispute between France and Canada over territorial waters claimed by the tiny French Atlantic Ocean islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Reuter reports from New York. The court, in a 3-to-2 vote, ruled that the islands, off the coast of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, have fishing rights up to 24 miles (40km) off their shores. They were also given a narrow 10.5-mile corridor that stretches 200 miles into the Atlantic. France had claimed fishing rights extending 200 miles from both islands. Canada had offered just a 12-mile limit. A drilling moratorium in the disputed zone, agreed by both countries in 1967, will be lifted shortly, allowing Canada to award contracts to oil companies. The two islands were ceded to France in 1773 by Canada as a haven for French fishermen.
19920728000000000	FT  28 JUL 92 / Spratly spat moves into murkier water: China's tactics set Asean alarm bells ringing. THE conflicting territorial claims to the Spratly islands have been vividly illustrated in photographs and television pictures released by the various claimants. The most recent, from Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, takes on an almost comical air. It shows three men on a tiny rock in the middle of the South China Sea with a Chinese flag, a concrete territorial marker and a hut - twice as big as the rock itself - standing on stilts in the shallows. Nothing could illustrate more clearly the nature of argument over the 100 or more atolls, reefs and islets that make up the Spratly islands: few people would want or be able to live there unsupported, but governments want to own them to lay claim to the surrounding waters. The islands - called the Nansha by China and the Kalayaan by the Philippines  -are scattered along the shipping route between the Indian Ocean and north-east Asia, and are believed to have oil and gas deposits under the seabed. The main protagonists in the dispute are China and Vietnam, but Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei also lay claim to all or some of the Spratlys. With the exception of the small sultanate of Brunei, all have troops stationed in the archipelago. At a south-east Asian summit six months ago, nobody gave much thought to a dispute which has simmered since the second world war and only occasionally erupted into violence. In February, however, China passed a law reaffirming its sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and reserving the right to use military force to defend its claims. Vietnam protested. So did Japan, because the Chinese law also embraced a group of islands claimed by Tokyo in the East China Sea. In May, as if to underline the message that the South China Sea was not called the South China Sea for nothing, the Chinese authorities signed an agreement with Crestone Energy Corp of Denver to explore for oil between Vietnam and Malaysia. The concession area is regarded by Vietnam as part of its continental shelf and lies about 1,000km south of the Chinese island of Hainan. Vietnam, which says it lost 72 men and three vessels in a battle with China over the Spratlys in 1988, protested again. Japan and the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - have watched China's forays into the Spratlys with growing alarm. At a meeting of foreign ministers in Manila last week, Malaysia said it was watching events with 'grave concern'; the Philippines said a solution should be urgently sought to avoid 'perilous developments'; and Indonesia spoke of the danger of 'mutually destructive confrontation'. Although only the Filipinos were openly prepared to admit it, there was considerable debate over the risk of Chinese expansionism and the desirability of continued US and Russian military deployment in the region to provide a 'balance of forces'. Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister who was a guest at the meeting, denied that China was seeking regional hegemony. China, he said, wanted to shelve disputes and proceed with 'joint development' of the Spratlys. However, Asean ministers were apparently unable to elicit an explanation as to how China reconciled its 1991 rapprochement with Vietnam and its talk of 'joint development' with the planting of new territorial markers on the atolls and the unilateral decision to award an exploration contract to Crestone. The region's optimists say it was inevitable that irritating disputes like the Spratlys would surface once the cold war ended. They believe that China, preoccupied with domestic politics and the strains of economic growth, is testing the mettle of its neighbours with its recent activities in the South China Sea. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, told the Asean meeting how much the region had progressed since he first came to Manila as a young diplomat in the 1950s. The pessimists, despite claims by the US and Russia that each intends to remain a Pacific power, view the end of the cold war and the closure of US bases in the Philippines with foreboding. They see China as a potential regional bully whose influence is already visible in Beijing's support for the Burmese junta and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia. 'The Chinese will have the option to use 'gunboat diplomacy' as a means to achieving their political objectives,' wrote Tai Ming Cheung in a paper on the growth of Chinese naval power for the Institute of South East Asian Studies. 'As the navy grows stronger, the chances of conflict over the Spratlys becomes an increasingly real possibility, unless a satisfactory diplomatic solution can be found in the next few years.' The paper was published in 1990.
19920723000000000	FT  23 JUL 92 / Asean calls for restraint in Spratlys dispute. THE SIX members of the Association of South East Nations yesterday sought to ease tensions over the disputed Spratly islands in the South China Sea by urging the countries involved to exercise restraint. In a special declaration at the end of a two-day meeting in Manila, the foreign ministers of Asean - grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - emphasised the need to resolve arguments over sovereignty and jurisdiction 'by peaceful means, without resort to force'. They suggested the establishment of 'a code of international conduct over the South China Sea' to be based on the principles of their regional Treaty of Amity and Co-operation, and resolved to explore the possibility of collaborating on maritime navigation, pollution control and anti-piracy operations in the area. The dispute over the Spratlys came to a head earlier this year when China reaffirmed its claim to the entire archipelago and granted an oil exploration licence to a US company in a zone also claimed by Vietnam. Asked whether Asean regarded China as a bully, Mr Raul Manglapus, foreign minister of the Philippines, replied: 'We have said China has its own historical claims which we might reject in the light of 20th century realities, but we have never said it's a bully.' A decision to set aside the issue of sovereignty over the Spratlys did not mean that the countries concerned could not peacefully continue or even reinforce their presence on the islands, he said. For the first time since it was founded 25 years ago in the shadow of the spread of communism in Indochina, Asean explicitly put the emphasis on security concerns. In another sign of the changing international climate, Vietnam and Laos were yesterday granted observer status at future Asean meetings.
19920722000000000	FT  22 JUL 92 / Falklands picks groups for oil study. THE FALKLAND Islands government has chosen two companies for a multi-million pound seismic study of territorially disputed waters in the South Atlantic from October, confirming its decision to exclude Argentina from the initial search for oil. But in a move which could lessen potential conflict between London and Buenos Aires over the issue, Falkland Islands officials have agreed to allow results of the survey to be made available to oil companies operating in Argentina. The UK Foreign Office is expected soon to give its formal seal of approval to the licensing arrangements between the islands' government and the two companies, Spectrum of the UK and Geco Prakla, a subsidiary of the New York-based energy services group Schlumberger. Both companies were picked from a list of groups that had expressed an interest to the British Geological Survey, the UK government-funded research organisation which is advising island officials. Under draft arrangements approved by the Falkland Islands government, the companies will spend more than Pounds 7m on high-technology seismic work expected to be completed by October 1993. Revenue from the results' sale will be shared between the companies and the Falklands government. The work will be carried out within a 200-mile zone around the islands. Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the Falkland Islands government, said the islands had a policy 'to do our own thing within our own waters'. But the decision to make the work available commercially is in part a concession to the Buenos Aires government.
19920722000000000	FT  22 JUL 92 / Spratly dispute over shadows Asean meeting. CHINA'S recent reaffirmation of its claim to the disputed Spratly islands in the South China Sea overshadowed the start of a meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) in Manila yesterday. Ministers expressed 'grave concern' about the threat to regional security. 'We cannot any more postpone the urgent necessity to seriously seek a solution,' President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines said in a speech to open the meeting of Asean foreign ministers, 'lest the unsettled situation lead to perilous developments'. Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian minister, said his country viewed the matter with 'grave concern'. The ministers of Asean - grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - raised the Spratlys issue at a meeting yesterday with Qian Qichen, their Chinese counterpart. They also spoke of their worries about the progress of the United Nations peace plan in Cambodia, where the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge faction is refusing to disarm its guerrillas. Most Asean ministers emphasised security concerns and gave second place to economic co-operation. The Spratlys, a scattered group of islets, atolls and coral reefs, have become a particularly sensitive issue since May, when China granted an oil exploration concession to Crestone Energy of the US in an area claimed by Vietnam. Six countries have laid claim to all or some of the Spratlys (China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines), but China passed a law in February reaffirming sovereignty over the islands of the South China Sea and reserving the right to use military force. In his meeting with Asean yesterday, Qian reiterated China's view that territorial differences should be 'shelved' in favour of joint development of the area, but he apparently did not explain how this fitted in with China's recent actions. According to Filipino officials, he suggested a security dialogue with Asean to enhance trust and rejected accusations that China was seeking to fill a power vacuum left by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the closure of US bases in the Philippines. 'It is not necessary for any country to fill up this so-called vacuum,' Qian said on Monday. He also told the Asean ministers that the dispute was being exaggerated, and that it would be better not to discuss it in public to avoid increasing tension. In 1988, China sank three Vietnamese naval vessels and killed 72 Vietnamese in a battle over the Spratlys.
19920720000000000	FT  20 JUL 92 / Asean talks will take up disputes over islands. FOREIGN ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) converge in Manila today for discussions this week on concrete programmes to expand regional co-operation. The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial disputes involving three Asean members - China, Vietnam and Taiwan - over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea, a quarrel which could deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil exploration in the area. The foreign ministers' gathering is their first since the January accord among the six Asean governments - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei - to transform the region into a free-trade area by 2007. They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Raul Manglapus, chairman of the Asean Standing Committee and Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary, said yesterday that the Spratley disputes will also be discused. The three Asean members involved - Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan all have claims on the islands. With the exception of Brunei, all also have troops on some of the islands, under which may lie oil and gas reserves. China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to drill for oil in the disputed territories, and Vietnam recently increased its campaign by wooing Malaysia to participate in one exploration venture. Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker on a reef and had earlier authorised its army to use force, if necessary, to control the islands. Nevertheless, Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, has been invited to the Manila meetings and is expected to hold talks with his Asean counterparts as a group and individually. Mr Manglapus said this week's meetings will tackle 'some guidelines (that) will provide us with the start of a kind of modus vivendi between contesting nations before a final resolution is arrived at'. And, while analysts are not optimistic that a definitive end to the disputes can be reached this week, Mr Manglapus noted 'a strong feeling on the part of our partners (for) a peaceful solution.'
19920709000000000	FT  09 JUL 92 / Vietnam accuses Chinese. VIETNAM has accused China of landing troops on a reef of the disputed Spratly islands in the South China Sea and planting a territorial marker. Vietnam's Beijing embassy confirmed reports of the landing, first published in the official Nhan Dan newspaper, and said Vietnam had lodged a formal protest. The protest note accused China of serious violation of Vietnamese sovereignty and demanded the marker be removed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment and there was no immediate independent confirmation of Vietnamese claims. The Spratly island group consists of 33 islands and 400 islets and atolls, straddling shipping lanes in the South China Sea. Its considerable strategic value is complemented by rich fishing grounds and deposits of oil and gas. Besides Vietnam and China, there are four other claimants to part or all of the disputed archipelago - the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. Vietnam protested loudly in May when China gave oil prospecting rights between the Spratlys and the Vietnamese coast to a US company, fearing Beijing was, in effect, annexing the territory.
19920918000000000	FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Denmark hands mineral rights to the Faroe Islands. THE Danish government has agreed to hand over all rights to exploit minerals in the Faroe Islands and Faroese offshore waters to the Faroese government. This resolves a dispute between the Danes and the Faroes, which has been one of the main obstacles to exploring for hydrocarbons off the North Atlantic islands, where geologists consider that the chances of finding oil and gas are good. But a new dispute, this time between Denmark and the UK, is threatening to halt prospecting. The Faroe Islands are a self-governing province of the Kingdom of Denmark, but foreign and defence policy remain the preserve of the metropolitan government in Copenhagen. The UK and Denmark are in dispute over the territorial demarcation line in offshore areas west of the Shetland Islands and south-east of the Faroe Islands. According to the Danish foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the proposed British line of demarcation is too close to the Faroe Islands and is totally unacceptable to Denmark. Denmark claims that the demarcation line should run about halfway between the Faroes and the Shetlands. Negotiations are taking place between Denmark and the UK, with the next meeting fixed for October 21 in London. If the dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation, the Danes have indicated that they will take it to the International Court at the Hague. Until the dispute is settled, it is thought unlikely that contracts will be awarded to oil and gas companies to begin exploration. There is a separate dispute over the demarcation line in the north-west Atlantic, where Britain's claim that Rockall should be the pivot of the line is not accepted by either Denmark or Ireland.
19920910000000000	FT  10 SEP 92 / Hanoi and Beijing give assurances on Spratly islands. THE foreign ministers of Vietnam and China gave assurances yesterday that their dispute over the Spratly islands in the South China Sea would not escalate into armed conflict, Reuter reports. Nguyen Manh Cam, Vietnamese foreign minister, said in New Delhi that Vietnam had repeated its demand that China stop prospecting for oil in what it called Vietnamese territorial waters. The area for which China has signed a drilling contract with a US company was on the continental shelf of Vietnam, and Hanoi has asked China to cancel the contract, Mr Cam said. But he added: 'We decided at our summit meeting that relations would not come back to the period of the past 10 years.' Vietnam and China fought a border war in 1979 and their navies clashed briefly over the Spratly Islands in 1988. In Bangkok, Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said the dispute would not affect normalisation of ties between the two communist neighbours. 'In our view, once the issue comes to peaceful negotiations, it is not difficult to reach agreement, or at least it will not lead to confrontation,' Qian said. Cam said Vietnam had proposed that the dispute be resolved through a regional effort by the six countries which have a total or partial claim on the Spratlys - China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan. China's industrial production jumped 19 per cent in the first eight months of 1992 compared with the same period last year, the Xinhua news agency reported yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Beijing. The State Statistical Bureau said that heavy industry output climbed 21.3 per cent from January to August and light industry 16.3 per cent to push total industrial production to 1,792bn yuan (Pounds 165bn).
19920907000000000	FT  07 SEP 92 / Vietnam accuses China in offshore oil dispute. VIETNAM'S dispute with China over maritime boundaries has worsened, with Hanoi accusing Beijing at the weekend of establishing an illegal drilling platform to explore for oil in Vietnamese waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. China and Vietnam restored 'normal' relations in November after years of tension, but the rapprochement was quickly soured by territorial disputes on land and at sea. In May, China signed an agreement with Crestone Energy of the US to explore for oil in an area of the South China Sea between Vietnam and Malaysia and 1,000km south of the Chinese island of Hainan. Vietnam said the zone was on its continental shelf. The latest dispute concerns a Chinese rig and seismic survey ships working off the northern Vietnamese province of Thai Binh in the Gulf of Tonkin. 'I think China will have to respond to the Vietnamese requests for an immediate halt to the oil-drilling and other activities in Vietnam's territorial waters,' Mr Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy foreign minister, told Reuters at the non-aligned summit in Jakarta. Asked if Vietnam would use force, he said: 'We do not want to seem as if we are preparing for confrontation. The question of territorial sovereignty is sacred to every nation.' On Saturday the Chinese foreign ministry said the Chinese ships were exploring in waters under Chinese jurisdiction. 'This is not something new, but the continuation of the oil exploration that has been going on there for quite some time,' it said. Even if Hanoi wanted to retaliate, Vietnam's navy is apparently too weak to mount operations against Chinese incursions or deter further encroachments. Instead, Vietnam is seeking common cause with other countries concerned about possible Chinese expansionism.
19920828000000000	FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (6): A post-Cold War dilemma / Discussing the country's 'abrasive' foreign policy. THERE IS no mistaking the anxiety aroused in south-east Asia by China's recent and loud reiteration of its claim to the South China Sea, a claim underlined by the granting of an oil exploration concession in May to a little-known American company in a disputed area near the Spratly islands. Notwithstanding China's statements to the contrary, the governments of the region believe that Beijing is taking advantage of a post-Cold War power vacuum - left by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of US forces from bases in the Philippines - to assert some authority over its weaker neighbours. The foreign ministers of Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations, comprising Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand) confronted the Spratlys dispute head-on at their annual meeting, held in Manila in July. They put their concerns directly to their Chinese counterpart Mr Qian Qichen, and appealled for a peaceful settlement of the various disputes. The claimants to the islets, reefs and atolls of the Spratlys include China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia - and all except Brunei have troops in the archipelago. Scuba-diving expeditions for tourists to one of the Malaysian-held islands are regarded as another useful way of asserting sovereignty. Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian foreign minister, told the Asean meeting that his government wanted to sustain Asean's record as the world's fastest growing economic region, and therefore viewed 'with grave concern' the revival of the Spratlys issue. 'Any adverse development leading to heightened tension or conflict could only result in dire consequences to the region's well-being,' he said, 'bringing in its wake the risk of extra-regional involvement and putting back years of painstaking efforts at nurturing relations based on mutual trust and confidence.' The end of the Cold War, in other words, has created something of a foreign policy dilemma for Malaysia, whose government regards itself as a champion of the developing world and the non-aligned movement. The disintegration of the Soviet Union threatens to give the United States an unacceptably dominant role in world affairs, but too great a reduction of the US presence in Asia could leave the way clear for equally unacceptable moves by regional powers such as China, India and Japan. Malaysia's response has been to continue condemning the west in public, while maintaining good relations with the western powers in practice and strengthening and rearming its own military forces. Western diplomats say hopefully that they detect a lessening of Malaysian rhetorical support for Zopfan - the south-east Asian, anti-superpower concept which stands for Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality. Aside from arms purchases, Malaysia's ties with the west include the five-power defence agreement (linking Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, Australia and New Zealand), a commercial deal to repair US Navy ships at Lumut on the west coast of the peninsula, and a US-Malaysian joint venture called Airod at Kuala Lumpur's Subang airport to maintain C-130 transport aircraft. Malaysian officials and Kuala Lumpur-based diplomats agree that Malaysia's abrasive foreign policy is very much the creation of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister. They attribute his combative speeches - whether he is rejecting criticism of Malaysia's logging industry or accusing the west of imperialism - partly to personal conviction and partly to his ambitions as a leader of the third world. 'He felt Malaysia would get more attention if it became more awkward,' said one senior diplomat. 'His desire is partly to make sure that Malaysia is not taken for granted, but also to put Malaysia on the map in a leadership role for the third world.' Dr Mahathir is said by his advisers to receive letters of support from other third world leaders, who agree with what he says but do not dare to say it themselves, although his confrontational style is not always appreciated. At home, some officials have sought to prevent him from antagonising the country's allies, and at the Earth Summit in Brazil in June he received less support than he would have liked for his adversarial approach to the industrialised nations. He also angered some of his fellow Asean leaders by announcing a proposal to set up an East Asian Economic Caucus - a controversial trade group excluding the US - without sufficient prior consultations. An increasingly important influence on Malaysian foreign policy is the country's domestic Islamic constituency, which has some sympathy for the newly-devout President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, for the Moslem inhabitants of Bosnia and for all things Moslem. Dr Mahathir often accuses the west of double standards - he recently commented that western countries were willing to interfere in defence of human rights in Malaysia but not in Israel or Bosnia - but his critics make the same accusation in reverse about Malaysia. It was noticeable that Malaysia took little interest in the persecution of the predominantly Buddhist Burmese people by the authorities in Rangoon until Burmese Moslems started fleeing into Bangladesh. 'Mahathir runs foreign policy, and some of what he does is aimed at protecting his Islamic flank,' says another diplomat. Perhaps the most commonly heard criticism of Malaysian policy is that it is old-fashioned, rooted in the 1960s and based on the questionable assumption that the world is divided into two rival factions - the rich industrialised north, and the poor exploited south. Such a world vision is difficult to reconcile with the reality of Asia: while Dr Mahathir was forging a third world consensus on the environment at a pre-Earth Summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur in April, companies and governments from north and south were happily selling weapons to each other at a defence exhibition a couple of kilometres away across town; in the South China Sea, Beijing - a leader of the south - is flexing its muscles to the detriment of its fellow southerners; and Malaysia, a champion of the south, is developing so successfully along capitalist lines that it is well on the way to becoming a fully paid-up member of the north.
19930413000000000	FT  13 APR 93 / Border bustle conceals neighbourly suspicion: A look at the tensions affecting Vietnam and China. NOTHING in the bustling commercial scene at the main border post between China and Vietnam contradicts the idea of a warm relationship suggested by the name Friendship Gate. Under a drizzling sky, cheerful traders carry boxes of Chinese apples, sewing machines and rice bowls from Chinese to Vietnamese lorries parked back-to-back in a sea of mud. A raucous, red-faced Chinese woman smuggling playing cards into Vietnam supervises her workers as they pile empty lightbulb cartons into a truck to hide the real merchandise. For the region's desperately poor inhabitants, the trade is a welcome spinoff of the 1991 'normalisation' of relations between Beijing and Hanoi - 12 years earlier the Chinese army invaded and laid waste this part of northern Vietnam to avenge the invasion of Cambodia and the overthrow of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge. But the busy scenes at the border belie the reality of the Sino-Vietnamese relationship. In spite of frequent exchanges of high-level dignitaries and the signing of several bilateral agreements, the two countries continue to regard each other with suspicion and, sometimes, outright hostility. Since last year China has not only dragged its feet in implementing trade agreements and attempted to extend its control across the frontier, but has made forays into the southern reaches of the South China Sea close to the Vietnamese coast. This has threatened development of Vietnam's vital oil industry and triggered alarm in other south-east Asian countries, such as Malaysia, about the future of the disputed Spratly islands. Beijing granted last year an offshore oil exploration concession to Crestone, a US company, in an area Vietnam says is on its continental shelf. Vietnam says China has also seized more than 20 cargo vessels plying the route between Hong Kong and northern Vietnam. The ships have been released but the Chinese, accusing the Vietnamese shippers of smuggling goods to China, have confiscated some cargo without compensation. 'China sees this as a good opportunity to fill the power vacuum left by the reduction of US forces in the region and the strategic retreat from the region made by Russia,' says Mr Nguyen Ngoc Dien of the Hanoi Foreign Ministry's Institute of International Relations. Vietnam treats Chinese denials with scepticism. 'In their declarations they are anti-hegemonist but in practice they are hegemonist in putting pressure on the smaller countries around them,' says Maj-Gen Tran Cong Man, a government spokesman. Even the booming border trade between the two countries is a source of friction. Vietnam says China is reluctant to promote official commerce - it has refused to re-open the railway near Friendship Gate - and is instead encouraging smuggling of Chinese consumer goods, a trade which undermines Vietnamese factories. 'With smuggling,' says Mrs Pham Chi Lan, of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 'we are spending a lot of hard currency needed for the import of capital goods on buying products that can be produced in Vietnam.' The Vietnamese, who have fought against Chinese domination for the last 2,000 years, are feeling particularly nervous about China's military and economic might at the moment. The peace agreement in neighbouring Cambodia appears to be falling apart, leaving the way clear for Khmer Rouge guerrillas, Beijing's former proteges, to kill Vietnamese settlers and cause trouble on the border. The trouble for Hanoi is that there is not much it can do without provoking China or undermining its fragile economic recovery. Ethnic Chinese businessmen still dominate the Vietnamese economy, and a large share of foreign investment is of Chinese ethnic origin, coming from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Vietnam's army has been halved in size to some 600,000 men, and the navy is too small to protect Vietnamese interests in the South China Sea. The Soviet Union, Vietnam's long-time ally, has disintegrated. Hence Vietnam's desperate attempts to make friends with the US - which maintains an economic and diplomatic embargo on Hanoi dating back to the Vietnam war - and to strengthen ties with the European Community. As one diplomat in Hanoi put it: 'Vietnam is in the unfortunate position of having lost one superpower and being unlikely to get an alliance with the one remaining.'
19930825000000000	FT  25 AUG 93 / China and Vietnam open talks. CHINA and Vietnam yesterday sought to open a new chapter in their vexed relations, with their first high-level talks on long-running territorial disputes, including a row over oil drilling rights in the Tonkin Gulf. Mr Tang Jiaxuan, China's vice foreign minister, talked of a 'new situation' in relations between the once close allies, and said that Beijing would 'participate in the negotiations with positive, practical and constructive attitudes'. Western officials in Beijing say that while it was important that the neighbours should have resumed discussions in an apparently cordial atmosphere, significant barriers remained to an early resolution of disputes over territory both in the Tonkin Gulf, and in the South China Sea where the two sides are locked in disagreement over ownership of the Spratly Islands. Mr Vu Khoan, Vietnam's vice foreign minister, said at a welcoming ceremony at China's state guest house that the two sides had come together to 'help resolve various problems left over from history'. Agreement on this new round of talks was reached during a visit to Hanoi last December by China's Premier Li Peng. That visit was aimed at establishing a new basis of trust and understanding after the mutual antagonism of the recent past. China, angered by Hanoi's invasion of Cambodia, launched a brief border war against Vietnam in 1979 which it described at the time as a 'counter attack in self defence'. Chinese forces received a 'bloody nose' at the hands of the Vietnamese. It was not until 1991 that relations were normalised again, but lingering mistrust delayed the resumption of serious efforts to resolve their differences.
19931019000000000	FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK and Argentina begin fish talks. BRITAIN AND Argentina began two days of talks yesterday to renew a temporary agreement on sharing fish catches in the South Atlantic. Britain wants to replace a one-year accord struck last December with a long-term agreement that protects the Falkland islands' revenues, while Argentina wants to increase substantially its fishing effort. The unresolved dispute over the Falklands, which Argentina claims despite defeat in its 1982 conflict with Britain, charges the talks with considerable political significance. Argentina began issuing fishing licences in competition with the Falklands this year for the first time. Although it agreed in December to sell only 45 licences, it still forced a 12 per cent drop in the islands' licensing revenues. In the financial year ending in June, the Falklands raised Pounds 23.5m in licensing revenues, compared with Pounds 26.8m in 1991-92. The Falklands Fisheries Directorate is planning to lower the price of its licences further and forecasts revenues this year of only Pounds 15m to Pounds 15.5m. Argentina also protested against London's decision earlier this year to extend to 200 miles the territorial waters surrounding the British-held South Georgia and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina also claims. The UK has introduced a licensing regime similar to the Falklands for the two islands. Buenos Aires is also using the fisheries talks to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves in waters surrounding the Falklands. The islanders have so far rejected oil talks with Argentina and last year licensed two companies to carry out preliminary seismic surveys. The islands plan to offer acreage to companies in 1994.
19931130000000000	FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (1): Too much, too soon - Free market reforms have led to a rush of business activity with Hanoi aiming to double GDP in the current decade. But with growth comes the threat of corruption, environmental destruction and a widening gap between rich and poor. The Vietnamese are enjoying themselves. After half a century of warfare and dour communist rule, the country's 70m inhabitants - urban and rural - have responded enthusiastically to the free market policies progressively introduced by the government over the past seven years. With an average per capita gross domestic product of Dollars 220 a year, Vietnam is still one of the world's poorest countries, but the traits of a modern consumer society are emerging everywhere from the trading towns on the Chinese border in the north to the beach resort of Vung Tau in the south. In the once sleepy capital Hanoi, foreigners and Vietnamese are building hotels, office blocks and private houses, replicating the construction and business boom which is already well under way in Ho Chi Minh City, the southern commercial centre previously known as Saigon. The public tennis courts in the central port city of Danang are packed with eager if inexpert players; in nearby Hue, students are contentedly drinking beer in bars which opened only months ago. In Ho Chi Minh City, a new supermarket was forced to close its doors after only four days because it could not meet the demands of its customers: the check-out queues were one and a half hours long. There is, as Vietnamese officials admit, an ugly side to Vietnam's transformation. Corruption, greed and prostitution have flourished in the liberal economic climate. But the incipient urban prosperity that allows the wealthier Vietnamese to buy new motorcycles and build new homes is underpinned by solid and nationwide economic achievements since the communist government launched its policy of doi moi (renovation). Ruthless restriction of the money supply has forced inflation down from more than 700 per cent in 1986 to less than 10 per cent today. Foreign investors have proposed Dollars 6.8bn of projects in the five years since the first foreign investment law was enacted. Exports - including rice, textiles and seafood - have been growing at an average 30 per cent a year in the same period. The economy grew by 8.3 per cent last year, a performance which will almost be matched in 1993. Vietnam reacted nimbly to the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, shifting the focus of its trade away from the former Soviet bloc countries to new partners in Asia and the west. According to the trade ministry, all of Vietnam's light industrial exports went to the east bloc in 1988. Last year the figure was 4 per cent. Most remarkable of all, the first stage of Vietnam's shift from central planning to the export-oriented industrialisation policies that have been so successful elsewhere in Asia was achieved with hardly any assistance from foreign donors. It was only in July that the US withdrew its objections to multilateral aid for Vietnam from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank. The US bilateral economic embargo dating back to the communist Vietnam War victory in 1975 remains in force, but the boycott is now at least as frustrating for American companies as it is for Vietnam. So much foreign aid money will flood into the country - Vietnam was promised Dollars 1.86bn at its first donors' conference in Paris this month - that the management skills of the government's Soviet-educated ministers and bureaucrats will be severely tested. The government has set a target of doubling Vietnam's GDP in the current decade, and it estimates that success will require a total investment of about Dollars 40bn - of which half is supposed to come from domestic sources and the remainder from foreign direct investment and foreign aid. Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, readily acknowledges the enormity of the task that lies ahead. In an introduction to the Vietnamese document prepared for the donor conference, he lamented the decline of social services and the severity of unemployment. He also emphasised the importance of repairing the country's battered infrastructure and spoke of the need to strengthen the legal system in order to allow the market economy to work properly. 'There is still much for us to do and there remain many difficulties to overcome in order to carry on with our renovation programme and to realise our socio-economic goals,' he wrote. Mr Kiet and his reformist allies are operating in a difficult political environment. Advocates of reform say social services were already declining under the bankrupt policies of the past and that the switch to a market economy - bringing with it the benefits of foreign aid and investment - was made only just in time. The World Bank, for example, estimates that half of Vietnamese children under six are malnourished. The inevitability of reform, however, has not prevented many Vietnamese from resenting the rampant corruption that has accompanied economic growth or from complaining that the good aspects of communism - free education for example - have been thrown out with the bad. Bereft of a coherent ideology, now that it has abandoned the command economy, the Communist Party of Vietnam is likely to find it increasingly difficult in the years ahead to justify its monopoly of power. Indeed, the central government is already being challenged by Buddhist monks in Hue demanding greater freedom of religion, and by local governments around the country eager to exercise their own authority and to keep for their own fiefdoms a share of the money generated by investment and economic reform. One of the hardest tasks for Hanoi on the domestic front will be to nurture the emerging Vietnamese private sector when both local and central government agencies are accustomed to supporting the state enterprises which fall under their control. The privatisation programme has stalled. Returning Vietnamese exiles, a potential source of capital and business skills, are often surprised after many years abroad to find that they are greeted with suspicion by long-lost acquaintances. The banking system is in urgent need of reform and a series of draft laws relating to business - including those on bankruptcy, the resolution of contract disputes and the promotion of domestic investment - are queueing up to be passed by the National Assembly at its next meeting in December. Several will have to wait until the subsequent session in June 1994, according to parliamentary officials. With so many basic tasks still needing to be performed, talk of establishing a stock market in Ho Chi Minh City is being dismissed by the government and by foreign bankers as premature. On the foreign policy front, Vietnam continues to have a difficult relationship with its powerful neighbour China. Beijing periodically sends ships into areas that Vietnam says are in its territorial waters, including zones set aside for oil exploration. This is one reason why Vietnam is anxious to restore full diplomatic ties with Washington. The US is regarded as the only plausible counterweight to Chinese expansionism in the region. Given the difficulties Vietnam faces, it is enough to hope that the country will be able to emulate east Asia's 'dragons' and achieve sustained economic growth into the next century. To expect Vietnam to go further and avoid the worst tendencies of its fast-growing neighbours - including corruption, environmental destruction and a widening gap between rich and poor - would probably be over-ambitious. 'Some people talk about the dragon,' says Do Duc Dinh, a Vietnamese economist, 'but I think it may take three or four decades to come to that, and it depends on our efforts.' In the eyes of some of the country's more thoughtful citizens, the Vietnamese are enjoying themselves too much, too soon.
19940127000000000	FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British oil brigade leads charge into Crimea - Jill Barshay reports on a joint-venture project for deep-water drilling in the Black Sea. The British-Ukrainian Crimean Petroleum Company will drill the first deep off-shore oil well in the Black Sea this spring, following the completion last month of a preliminary geological study last month that confirmed the location of a likely oil deposit in the sea's north-western shelf. If the well, 3,300m below the sea floor and 90km off the Crimean coastline, strikes oil the joint venturers expect an annual oil yield of 2m tonnes and additional investment of Dollars 1.5bn into the sea-shelf project. 'This will be the first deep oil well in the history of the Black Sea. No one has ever tried this before,' says Mr Nikolai Ilnitsky, deputy general director of Chornomorneftgaz (which translates as Black-Sea-Oil-Gas), the state enterprise representing the Ukrainian side. 'We have a very, very exciting prospect,' says Mr Richard Humphreys of JP Kenny Exploration, the British partner of Crimean Oil Company. 'The Black Sea is one of the few areas in the world that is unexplored. . . 'We have a licence for one of the most promising areas. We are looking forward to drilling the first well'. Despite the high risks, the virtually unexploited Black Sea shelf has attracted British energy companies, such as JP Kenny and British Gas, with their advanced North Sea oil drilling technology. British Gas signed a co-operation agreement last month with Chornomorneftgaz to conduct geological research in the Black Sea's eastern Kerch shelf. Ukraine is eager for British know-how because Soviet technology not equal to drilling farther down than 70m, keeping off-shore exploration near the coastline. But the Black Sea's oil potential is much farther off-shore where the water depth is 80m and oil deposits are thousands of metres below the sea floor. American, Dutch and Norwegian companies also have experience with deep sea drilling, but the British have come first to the Crimea, where they fought against the Russians 140 years ago. Mr Humphreys said: 'British companies are very well placed. Ukraine needs western sea technology which can go down thousands of metres. We've done this in the North Sea'. Ukraine, in turn, is eager for western investment to develop domestic oil sources in order to reduce their 90 per cent oil and gas dependence on neighbouring Russia and alleviate their current energy crisis. In Crimea, where the joint venture is based, energy shortages have shut down 35 per cent of all enterprises and forced another 55 per cent to operate at half capacity. Aircraft at the capital's airport are grounded for lack of fuel and most scheduled flights have been cancelled. Anxious to keep oil at home, the Ukrainian government has reserved the first option to buy JP Kenny's 49 per cent share of Crimea Petroleum Company's production at world market prices. If Ukraine is unable to pay, JP Kenny may export the oil abroad, according to the joint-venture agreement, signed in April of last year. Despite the Ukrainian and British sides' optimistic assessments, deep off shore drilling in Crimea is as fraught with risk as it is in other areas. Huge drilling expenditures (Dollars 7m-Dollars 8m for each drilling attempt) are often for naught, as even the most thorough seismic analysis cannot reduce the two-to-one odds against striking oil in the seas. In addition, the unsettled Ukrainian-Russian territorial dispute over Crimea could threaten current contracts, which have been negotiated with Ukrainian authorities. Crimea was transferred from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction only 40 years ago. Many Crimean Russians, who make up 70 per cent of the population, would like to reunite with their ethnic kin.
19940127000000000	FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greece to offer onshore and offshore concessions. Greece's Public Petroleum Corporation (DEP) plans to offer concessions for onshore and offshore oil exploration in western Greece later this year. Blocks in Epirus and the Ionian Sea would be made available to international bidders after parliament passed a new law on oil exploration and exploitation, 'probably in late spring', according to Mrs Teresa Fokianou-Malaveta, the corporation's chairman. DEP's research department said seismic studies in Epirus produced encouraging results, while test drilling in the Ionian Sea had established the existence of oil-bearing levels, she added. Under production-sharing arrangements included in the new legislation DEP would have the right to participate with a minority stake in consortia exploiting oil deposits in Greece. Meanwhile, a new test drilling is being made by North Aegean Petroleum Corporation at the Prinos offshore field near Thassos island in the north-eastern Aegean. The drilling is the first by NAPC, a Canadian-led consortium, since Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war in 1987 over conflicting claims to offshore oil rights in the Aegean. The dispute has prevented NAPC from exploring for oil east of Thassos. Production at the Prinos field, situated west of Thassos in Greek coastal waters, has declined from 26,000 barrels a day in the early 1980s to about 8,000 b/d last year. However, the introduction of gas re-injection techniques, using natural gas from the nearby South Kavalla offshore field, has lifted production to around 12,000 b/d. If successful, the Dollars 5.3m drilling project, reaching 2,000 metres below sea level, could yield up to 6,000 b/d, Mrs Fokianou-Malaveta said. The Greek government last year signed a new six-year production agreement with NAPC, giving the consortium a more favourable tax arrangement than previously. The consortium had considered shutting down its operations because of the political obstacles to exploiting known oil and gas deposits east of Thassos. It has invested Dollars 700m in Greece since it won the Prinos concession 20 years ago. Denison Mines of Canada controls 58 per cent of the consortium. DEP holds 15 per cent, with subsidiaries of three other international oil companies, Wintershall Greece, Hellenic Overseas Holdings and White Shields Greece, holding smaller stakes.
19940126000000000	FT  26 JAN 94 / British offer over Falklands oil. The British government has indicated its readiness to allow Argentine companies to take part in the development of oilfields in the Falkland islands' territorial waters - provided they acknowledge that any oil extracted belongs to Britain. Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine interests will end up operating installations on the islands themselves, but believe Argentina's coast could be a logical site for support operations. Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year around the Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil across a zone 25 per cent larger than the North Sea. The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent request from Buenos Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials to discuss joint development of oil resources. London has yet to agree to this meeting. Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next important policy objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms that implicitly recognise Britain's sovereignty over the islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks on fish to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves. British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company. Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that rapprochement with Argentina would probably be necessary if an oil industry were to be developed. Recent developments come against a background of steadily improving relations between the two former belligerents. A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the first UK cabinet minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 Falkland islands conflict. Since then both Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, and Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, have visited Britain.
19940121000000000	FT  21 JAN 94 / An outsider looking in: Turkey's hopes for closer European ties. The joint visit to Ankara yesterday of Douglas Hurd and Klaus Kinkel, foreign ministers of their respective countries, was an unprecedented Anglo-German initiative. It would be normal for either to visit Turkey alone or, in special circumstances, for both to participate in a European Union mission. But the latter would be formally led by the country occupying the presidency, which since January 1 is Greece. In this case Greece was not only unrepresented, but its absence was virtually the object of the exercise. For different reasons both the UK and Germany see themselves as Turkey's main friends and advocates within the EU; and even though British officials insist no discourtesy to Greece is intended, both governments are anxious to reassure the Turks that the six-month Greek presidency will not damage EU-Turkish relations. The Turks are delighted by the gesture, while Greece has denounced it as a breach of the EU common foreign and security policy, supposedly in operation since the Maastricht treaty came into force last November 1. The meeting provides a potent reminder of the importance west European countries attach to their relationship with Turkey - 'not a luxury but a necessity', Mr Hurd said on Wednesday - and of their impatience with Greek efforts to block that relationship in the hope of extorting Turkish concessions on Cyprus. Greek-Turkish relations, seldom warm even before Turkey occupied two-fifths of Cyprus and drove out the Greek-speaking population in 1974, have been almost continuously tense since then. Their bilateral relations are also envenomed by a long-running dispute about oil-exploration rights on the continental shelf under the Aegean Sea - an issue which came close to causing war in 1989, and which Greece now threatens to revive. But in western Europe Turkey is increasingly seen as the political and commercial hub of the eastern Mediterranean, as well as a potentially stabilising influence in the Turkic-speaking republics of the former Soviet Union. In Europe as in the US, Turkey is viewed as a regional power, a secular democratic role model, and a buffer to Islamic expansion in the Middle East. Turkey, as one senior British official put it, is a 'trusted and valuable interlocutor' in a range of trouble spots from the Balkans, to the Caucasus, central Asia and the Middle East. But it may not stay that way, unless Europe succeeds in complementing the defence aspects of the relationship with stronger political and economic ties. This month, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, visited Athens and appealed to Greece to adopt a 'realistic and strategic view of Turkey's importance'. Turkey is already smarting at the way its application for EU membership has been politely shelved since 1989 - while Efta countries, and perhaps even former communist satellites in central and eastern Europe, are allowed to jump the queue. The latter prospect, clearly flagged by last year's Copenhagen summit, is especially galling to the Turks who feel their record as solid Nato allies since the mid 1950s, and their support for the west in the Gulf war, entitle them to expect better treatment. Many of the reservations about Turkey's qualifications for EU membership expressed by the Commission in 1989 still stand: the problems presented by Turkey's large population; its heavy dependence on agriculture for employment; and perhaps most emphatically, its less than creditable human rights record. A recent debate in the British House of Lords, strongly critical of Turkish policy towards its Kurdish minority, was a salutary reminder for Turkish officials of the difficulty the country faces in improving its image in the west. The next few months will provide a significant test for both the EU and the Turkish government in their efforts to keep Turkey's European ambitions on track. Barring upsets, a customs union between Turkey and the EU is due to start in 1995. This will be the biggest change in Turkey's trading conditions since it signed an association treaty with the European Community in 1963, and the country has embarked on an ambitious programme of economic, social and political reforms aimed at bringing its institutions into line with those of its European partners. At the same time the Turks are eagerly seeking clarification of the offer of associate membership of the Western European Union - the EU's defence arm and 'European pillar' of Nato - made to them last year, which they have yet to put to their parliament for ratification. During his visit, Mr Hurd tried to define a comprehensive agenda, aimed at transforming the EU Turkish relationship: completion of the customs union on time, a more intensive political dialogue on issues covered by the EU's common foreign and security policy, and a deepening of the defence relationship - while at the same time Turkey has to push ahead with legal and human rights reforms at home. The UK is also urging Turkey to make renewed efforts to reach an early solution of the Cyprus problem, stressing that this has been an obstacle to improved relations, not just with Greece, but with Europe as a whole and indeed the US. It will not be easy, since the Turkish Cypriot leader Mr Rauf Denktas is attached to his independent status, while the Greek Cypriot president, Mr Glafkos Clerides, elected last year, is on the whole less flexible than his predecessor. The latest war of words would suggest there is still some way to go to create a climate of confidence to resolve the issue. In addition, the Greeks have until now used their veto powers to block EU financial assistance due to Turkey under the so-called fourth financial protocol, and have refused to approve the 'Matutes package', a programme of support for Turkey prepared in the wake of the Commission's negative opinion on the Turkish application for full membership. Turkey's foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, has already thrown down the challenge to his European partners. 'It is not that Turkey is in need of the money,' he says. 'The issue is whether the Union has the will to overcome the veto of just one of its members.' Mr Hurd's and Mr Kinkel's visit may have partly reassured him but, coming in a week when the Turkish lira collapsed as several key economic indicators diverged further from the European norm, it should also have served to demonstrate that Turkey's problems with the EU are by no means all of Greek origin.
19940322000000000	FT  22 MAR 94 / Icelandic trawler detained in disputed Rockall waters. An Icelandic-owned fishing vessel, the Rex, is being held in Stornoway Harbour, Lewis, for alleged illegal fishing in disputed waters near Rockall island. The trawler was spotted by a Fisheries Protection Agency plane on Sunday about 150 miles west of Rockall, claimed as British territory since 1955. An agency patrol boat and the Royal Navy vessel HMS Orkney escorted the Rex to Stornoway. According to the Fishery Limits Act any unlicensed foreign vessel caught fishing within 200 miles of British territory is breaking the law. Ownership of Rockall, which is 200 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and uninhabited, is disputed. Iceland and Denmark claimed in 1985 that Rockall was within a 'continental-shelf boundary' around their countries, which would give them territorial rights. The Irish republic also rejects Britain's claim to the island, which is only a few hundred square yards. The Foreign Office said: 'As far as we are concerned it is not disputed at all.' The waters around Rockall are valuable for fishing and there is strong evidence of oil below the island. The skipper of the Rex could be liable for a fine of up to Pounds 50,000. Mr Helgi Agustsson, Iceland's ambassador to Britain, said his government had offered the owners help in finding legal assistance. Iceland maintains that uninhabited rocks are not a basis for the extension of fishing limits but is not planning to file a claim on Rockall.
19940428000000000	FT  28 APR 94 / Argentina and UK to hold oil talks. Britain and Argentina are to hold talks in July on joint oil exploration in waters surrounding the Falkland Islands, two years after a previous round of oil talks collapsed. A British official said negotiators would focus on the next phase of exploration. The Falklands' government plans a second licensing round for seismic explorations beginning in July and running until March 1995. The Falklands selected two companies to carry out initial seismic surveys shortly after the 1992 negotiations failed. Argentina broke off talks after failing to agree on demarcation of Falkland waters bordering its territorial waters. International oil companies say co-operation with Argentina is important, given the need for heavy investments in a disputed zone. A UK official said successful joint management of fish stocks showed the sovereignty dispute could be put aside while both sides pursued practical interests, but Argentina's foreign ministry argues oil is different because it is a non-renewable resource, with important legal and tax ramifications. Both sides fear concessions over oil would imply recognition of the other's sovereignty claim. The Falklands remain a fixation in Argentina, which still claims the islands, despite defeat in the 1982 conflict with Britain. President Carlos Menem says Argentina will 'recover' the islands by the year 2000. Argentine security forces have raided a secret training camp in thick forest close to Buenos Aires used by paramilitaries linked to right-wing army rebels who have led four mutinies since 1987.
19940513000000000	FT  13 MAY 94 / Spratly oil contract irks China. China yesterday denounced Vietnam's contract with US oil company Mobil as a violation of Beijing's sovereignty in the South China Sea, but has pledged to settle all disputes peacefully, Reuter reports from Beijing. The foreign ministry reiterated Beijing's claim to the entire area around the Spratly Islands, including an area where Mobil has said it would press on with offshore oil exploration work. 'China possesses irrevocable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and the adjacent waters,' Mr Wu Jianmin said, using China's name for the disputed group. He said the Blue Dragon plot where Mobil wants to explore comes into the area of China's control in the waters 'adjacent' to the Spratlys. Vietnam says the plot is part of its continental shelf. The offshore row heated up last month when Crestone Energy of Denver said it had begun seismic surveys in an area immediately east of the Blue Dragon field. Beijing awarded the contract to Crestone in 1992.
19940725000000000	FT  25 JUL 94 / First meeting for Asia-Pacific forum. North Korea's nuclear programme, the Cambodian civil war and territorial disputes over the islands and oilfields of the South China Sea will be among the topics of debate today at the launch of an 18-member multilateral security forum for Asia and the Pacific. But the foreign ministers attending the first, three-hour meeting of the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok say they are unlikely to make substantial decisions on such issues until they have reach agreement on the role of ARF itself. The organisation, the first of its kind in Asia, is being founded to discuss Asian security following the end of the cold war. Russia's power in the region has diminished with the collapse of international communism, and the US has withdrawn some of its military forces from the Pacific, while Chinese economic and military influence is on the rise. All three superpowers are members. ARF comprises the six countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - as well as the US, the European Union, Japan, China, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea. The various foreign ministers already meet annually for political and economic talks, and regional security has now been added to their list of concerns. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, opened this year's Asean meeting by calling for urgent efforts to avert any armed confrontation that might arise from territorial disputes in Asia. 'The competition for ocean space and resources in the South China Sea is a particularly worrisome prospect,' he said. 'A regional arms race is another concern. The creation of some kind of regional arms control regime can deter arms build-ups.' Some ARF members, led by Australia and encouraged by the US, want to ensure that the organisation develops quickly and begins to take concrete measures to improve security. They also want officials of the member countries to meet more than once a year. China, on the other hand, favours a slower start for ARF, apparently because it does not want to become enmeshed in multilateral negotiations over territorial disputes when it has so much clout in bilateral meetings. Several ideas for enhancing regional security have already been aired ahead of today's inaugural meeting. The first is an exchange of defence white papers, so that each government can understand how the others perceive their strategic interests and the threats that face them. Another proposal is to establish a regional arms register, especially since some ARF members have yet to disclose details of their weapons to the United Nations register. The need to settle territorial disputes is likely to remain near the top of the agenda, especially in and around the Spratly islands in the South China Sea, where six Asian countries have overlapping claims and China and Vietnam have both awarded oil exploration concessions in disputed zones. One suggested solution is a 'joint development zone' for oil and gas modelled on the offshore zone now being exploited by Thailand and Malaysia.
19941107000000000	FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (4): Spratly Islands row heats up - Dispute over offshore oil and gas resources. It is possible that a group a submerged reefs in the South China Sea could be the site of the world's next big conflict involving the ownership of oil resources. At issue is the ownership of the Spratly Islands and their surrounding seas which are claimed, in whole or part, by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The main protagonists in the dispute are, however, China and Vietnam. They have come to blows once - in 1988 when China sank two Vietnamese vessels with the loss of more than 70 lives - and continue to frustrate each other's attempts to mine the oil and gas believed to be in liberal supply below the sea. The South China Sea is one of the world's most important shipping lanes. The possibility of a naval conflict over sovereignty would engage the vital interests of Japan - 70 per cent of its oil imports pass through the sea - and surrounding claimants. The US, which is not taking sides, would inevitably become involved if hostilities broke out  - 'the Chinese government's position is clear,' says Chen Bingqin, vice-president, China National Offshore Oil Corp. 'We want to put the dispute on the shelf and explore (for oil and gas) jointly. It is the only way peacefully to explore the area.' On the question of sovereignty, a senior Chinese government official was adamant: 'Sovereignty belongs to China and that's a matter that brooks no discussion.' China claims that there was never any dispute about its sovereignty in the South China Sea until oil and gas were discovered in the 1970s. The Spratly Islands are too far south to show on the above map of China. The size of Beijing's territorial claim - 80 per cent of the South China Sea - is breathtakingly audacious, even by China's standards. The U-shaped claim runs the length of Vietnam's coast and along the western coast of the Philippine islands, meeting off the coast of Brunei and Malaysia to the south. In 1990, Beijing offered to put the issue of sovereignty to one side and embark upon joint development of the South China Sea. But in May 1992, China awarded Crestone, a relatively small US oil explorer, the right to drill for hydrocarbons in a bloc situated at the extreme south-west of its claimed territory. In retaliation, Vietnam awarded a consortium of oil companies, led by Mobil of the US, a bloc adjacent to Crestone's and within China's territorial claim. This group began prospecting in June. Both countries have offered naval support to their respective prospectors. In June the Vietnamese navy interfered with a Chinese vessel conducting a seismic survey of Crestone's bloc. The Vietnamese claim similar interference by the Chinese navy. For China, which is likely to remain a net oil importer for many years to come, the promise of abundant oil reserves in the South China Sea would be a boon to its offshore oil industry. Since 1982, offshore oil finds in the Yellow and East China seas have failed to live up to early expectations. This year the China National Offshore Oil Corporation expects to produce 44m barrels of oil from 12 fields. It hopes to double production by 1997 when other areas come on stream. Vietnam, by contrast, is extracting 33m barrels a year from one field in the South China Sea, with production set to rise sharply with the addition of two more oil fields in production by the end of this year.
19941017000000000	FT  17 OCT 94 / UK-Argentine gas venture. British Gas and YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, have been discussing the formation of a joint venture to explore for hydrocarbons in disputed South Atlantic waters. 'We would both like to form a long-term partnership,' said Mr John Bueno, general manager of British Gas Argentina. Such an alliance would, in addition to other projects, seek to explore waters between Argentina and the Falkland Islands. British Gas already has a big presence in Argentina with important stakes in privatised gas distribution and power companies. But Mr Bueno stressed that talks between the companies could go no further until the British and Argentine governments had constructed the political framework within which exploration could proceed. Although Argentina was defeated in the 1982 war over the Falklands, it has not relinquished its claim over the islands, ownership of which was recently enshrined in the constitution. Buenos Aires disputes Britain's right unilaterally to exploit a non-renewable resource in internationally disputed waters.
19941123000000000	FT  23 NOV 94 / Beijing and Hanoi aim to settle differences over Spratlys. China and Vietnam agreed yesterday to work peacefully to resolve their disputes over territorial and maritime boundaries, and are to set up a group of experts to discuss their rival claims to the Spratly atolls and the waters of the South China Sea. A joint communique released at the end of a three-day visit to Vietnam by China's President Jiang Zemin said the two governments agreed to 'refrain from all acts that make things more complicated or broaden conflicts'. The dispute over the South China Sea is especially sensitive, because each country is seeking to exploit oil and gas reserves believed to lie under the sea bed. Both countries have awarded oil exploration contracts to US oil companies in disputed waters. Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi the two sides could shelve disputes and start 'joint development' if problems could not be resolved in talks immediately. Joint development of possible oil and gas fields in disputed maritime areas is a proven method of overcoming conflicts between two countries, but might not succeed in all areas of the sea because there are four other claimants to some or all of the islands: Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. Relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in the past few years. But Vietnamese officials say China has recently encroached on their territory near the border, refused to open a railway link to allow normal trade across the land frontier, and let Chinese traders smuggle cheap Chinese goods into Vietnam. Mr Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese president, may not have brought much in the way of concrete achievements, but suggests the two governments want to set aside their differences and concentrate on the similar challenges each faces: keeping their one-party communist political systems intact while liberalising the economy.
19941117000000000	FT  17 NOV 94 / US cruiser tracks Greek and Turkish contingents: Marine rights row leads to fear of war between Nato neighbours. A US Navy cruiser was yesterday monitoring Greek and Turkish naval activities in the Aegean, where fears of war have been triggered by the start of a new international law. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been hailed in Athens as a vindication of its long-standing argument that it has the right to extend its territorial waters from 6 miles to 12. Turkey has said that any such move by Athens would turn the Aegean into a 'Greek lake' and would be resisted by force. Greece says it has no plans to extend its territorial waters, but it will not renounce the right to do so. An opinion poll published this week showed that 79 per cent of Turks would support war if Greece declared a 12-mile limit. The quarrel dates from an offshore oil strike west of the Greek island of Thasos more than 20 years ago. The Athens government rejects Turkish proposals for joint oil exploration in the Aegean. The Cape St George, a US cruiser equipped with the latest electronic surveillance devices, was yesterday tracking Turkish warships and Greek aircraft across the Aegean. President Bill Clinton has written to the leaders of both countries urging them to show restraint and avoid the risk of clashes. Mr Mumtaz Soysal, the Turkish foreign minister, said Ankara has assured Mr Clinton that it had taken all possible measures to avoid a clash. Mr Soysal met Mr Karolos Papoulis, his Greek counterpart, in The Hague this week, but there was little sign of a change in positions. Turkey wants across-the-board negotiations on all the issues which it says are in dispute. Greece says the only issue that needs discussing is that of seabed mineral rights, which it wants settled by international arbitration. Relations between Athens and Ankara have also been worsened by the war in former Yugoslavia, where Turkey supports the Bosnian Moslems while Greece has traditional links with the Serbs. Turkey was the only European member of Nato to support the US withdrawal from the arms embargo against Bosnia. Recently, Turkey gave a new thrust to the old antagonisms by accusing Greece of harbouring guerrillas from the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) fighting in eastern Turkey. The US Navy, in this year's annual intelligence report, described the Greek-Turkish standoff as one of the 'most worrisome situations developing in Europe and the most dangerous to Nato as an institution'. The report says tension in the Aegean has also been stoked by supplies to both countries of new and secondhand ships from other Nato countries. Diplomats said they were alarmed that a hot-line between the two countries, set up after they came close to war in 1987, had ceased to function. Turkey is conducting its manoeuvres this week in international waters in the northern Aegean. About 100 miles to the south, the Greek navy is in charge of a Nato exercise held every year involving ships and aircraft from the US, France, Italy, Spain and the UK.
19941116000000000	FT  16 NOV 94 / Law of the Sea promises many disputes. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which enters full force today, seems likely to be treated by coastal states as a rich source of legal and rhetorical arguments to be used against rivals. This is in spite of the fact that the last thing the law's drafters wanted was to provide disputatious countries with extra torpedoes. One of the law's ostensible purposes is to encourage compromises over the exploitation of maritime resources, even among countries with unresolved disputes. Apart from a standoff in the Aegean - where Turkey has threatened war if Greece extends its territorial waters to 12 miles - one of the most grave maritime disputes involves China and Vietnam, locked in a war of words over oil rights in the South China Sea. Both China and Vietnam claim to be acting in accordance with the Law of the Sea but their interpretations of the document are miles apart. Over the last month, China has accused Vietnam of infringing its interests in international waters by inviting US and European companies to explore for oil in the Tonkin Gulf. Vietnam has retorted that it is exercising its legitimate rights in the economic zone to which it is entitled by the UN convention. It said that under the terms of that treaty, there were no international waters in the Gulf. This dialogue of the deaf reflects confusion over the difference between territorial waters - which may be extended, under the UN Law, up to 12 miles  -and the 'economic zone' which coastal states are entitled to claim, amounting to either 200 miles or the full extent of their continental shelf, whichever is larger. China and Vietnam are also arguing over resources around the Spratly Islands, a group of reefs and atolls whose other would-be owners are Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines. China has awarded an exploration contract to the US company Crestone for an area south-west of the Spratlys, while Vietnam has awarded a consortium led by Mobil a bloc slightly further to the west. Each state has denounced the other's contract. Sovereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding economic zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the salience of this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters force. However a study by a London-based law firm, maintains that the law favours pragmatic joint exploitation accords, even among countries with unresolved disputes.* Laying out the common-sense arguments for such accords, it notes that oil deposits which straddle two states' economic zones cannot be exploited by one without damaging the other's interests. When one state drills, oil from the rival state's zone is liable to flow across the boundary line as a result. Article 83 of the UN convention says that pending final agreement on zones, countries should 'make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature'. As an example of such a deal, the study cites the 1989 accord between Australia and Indonesia over waters south of Timor. However, such accords are not a panacea. Portugal - still seen by the UN as legal administrator of East Timor - has challenged Australia's right to enter the accord, before the International Court of Justice. The entry into force of the UN Law comes a year after its ratification by the minimum of 60 states. Another breakthrough came this summer when provisions on deep-sea mining - outside the zones of any country - were amended so as to convince the US, the UK and Germany to sign. *Paper by Charles Robson of Lovell White Durrant, 65 Holborn Viaduct, London EC1A 2DY
