19931101000000000	FT  01 NOV 93 / London and Dublin press on with initiative: Governments 'will not be diverted by gunmen' - Widespread support for talks / Killings condemned. THE BRITISH and Irish governments yesterday stressed their determination not to allow the Northern Ireland peace process to be derailed by Saturday's mass shooting in County Londonderry. Downing Street said Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has been kept closely informed about the shootings, would not be diverted by the gunmen. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said terrorists had to be prevented from dictating the political agenda in the province. He added: 'Last night's slaughter of the innocents puts more pressure on us to accelerate our efforts to find a formula for the cessation of violence and get the constitutional parties back around a negotiating table. 'One of our major problems is the lack of a political process and dialogue. Consequently the men of violence are allowed to take centre stage, and that has to be addressed immediately.' The London-Dublin initiative was condemned by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who said it was part of the 'nationalist agenda'. He said the initiative had 'raised the temperature' in the province. 'We are only half a step away from Northern Ireland being out of control. If the violence continues like this the ordinary man is going to take sides for protection.' However, there was widespread support for the governments' determination to press ahead. Mr Kevin McNamara, Britain's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said the killings were 'absolutely horrendous'. It was 'urgent that full attention should be paid to the Major-Reynolds initiative to find a solution which will respect the integrity of both communities and to establish institutions which can be useful both to the people of Northern Ireland and to the people of Ireland'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP, said the shootings were 'another bloody milestone in the move towards peaceful resolution of the problems here'. Dr Robin Eames, the Anglican primate of all Ireland, said he did not believe that the joint statement by Mr Reynolds and Mr Major had prompted the killings. 'Obviously people's minds will centre on the reaction to the recent inter-governmental announcement, but my experience is that these terrorists, whoever they are, don't have to look for a reason,' he said. 'This is psychopathic blood-letting and their so-called banner of 'For God and Ulster' on the one side and 'For a united Ireland' on the other are now irrelevant to most people.' Mr Martin McGuinness, vice-president of Sinn Fein, said the murders were a brutal reminder of the conflict in Northern Ireland. He urged the nationalist community to remain calm and vigilant. Mr Philip McGarry, chairman of the Alliance party, said the shootings were 'a disgraceful landmark'. He called on people to support the security forces.
19931101000000000	FT  01 NOV 93 / Unionists pressed by Dublin to back peace initiative: Major condemns 'act of butchery' after seven die in pub massacre. THE IRISH government stepped up pressure on Unionist leaders yesterday to join round table talks on the province's future in the wake of Saturday's murder of seven people by the Loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he was determined not to allow the process to be derailed by the killings in a bar in Greysteel, Co Derry. But the peace initiative launched by the British and Irish governments was rejected yesterday by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who warned that Northern Ireland was close to civil war. Terrorists from both sides have killed 23 people in the past nine days in a cycle of violence provoked by last weekend's bombing of a shop in Belfast, which killed 10 people. The violence continued yesterday when an RUC officer was shot by the IRA in Newry. Mr Reynolds said Unionists had 'nothing to fear' from the initiative. 'As long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish the present status to remain, that's the way it will be.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he hoped to arrange a series of meetings with Unionist leaders, probably lasting up to 12 months. But Mr Robinson said the joint statement issued by Mr John Major and Mr Reynolds in Brussels on Friday was 'an endorsement of the six-point plan for a united Ireland laid out last week by Mr Spring. Whoever it was aimed at, it was not aimed at Unionists because it is adopting a nationalist agenda'. However, UK ministers were heartened by the restrained reaction of Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the official Ulster Unionist party (UUP), who has made no public comment. The British government believes that constitutional guarantees and changes to parliamentary procedures for Northern Ireland legislation may persuade Mr Molyneaux to join the talks. The government is moving to set up a Commons committee on Ulster and may also end the use of non-amendable orders in council for Northern Ireland legislation. Other UUP leaders remained wary. Mr David Trimble, the party's home affairs spokesman, said Mr Spring was guilty of 'self-deception'. Mr Major, who is expected to make a statement on the peace initiative in the Commons today, said the killings were 'another evil act of butchery in which members of both communities were mown down'. He said: 'I appeal to all the people of Northern Ireland to show no tolerance to the gunmen and the bombers.' Mr Major is expected to distance the Anglo-Irish initiative from the proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Hume said yesterday that the SDLP-Sinn Fein proposals remained the best prospect for peace. He said it was 'difficult to accept' that the Hume-Adams proposals had been dismissed by the London and Dublin. Mr Hume accused Mr Major of being unwilling to discuss the proposals. Downing Street said Mr Hume had not requested a meeting with Mr Major. However, the prime minister has said before that he is willing to meet party leaders, including Mr Hume, at any time. The British government is determined not to be seen to be talking to the IRA through Mr Hume, but is also keen not to undermine Mr Hume's position as a leader of constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland. The prospects for the Anglo-Irish initiative will become clearer this week when Mr Spring meets Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in Belfast.

19931030000000000	FT  30 OCT 93 / Leaders in new drive for Ulster peace plan. THE British and Irish governments last night responded to the escalating violence in Northern Ireland with a new drive towards a political settlement. Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds agreed during talks in Brussels to speed up work towards a framework agreement to persuade Ulster's constitutional parties to return to the negotiating table. They rejected as a basis for peace the conclusions of recent talks between Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no question' of the two governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of the dialogue. That report was passed yesterday for the first time to Mr Major by Mr Reynolds. A joint communique, however, released by the British and Irish prime ministers after their meeting, left open the possibility of Sinn Fein being brought into the peace process if and when 'a renunciation of violence had been made and sufficiently demonstrated'. In those circumstances 'new doors could open'. At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the 'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds reaffirmed their determination to restart the stalled negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political settlement to the province. Their cautiously upbeat tone followed the Dublin government's acknowledgement earlier this week of the right of the Unionist community to exercise a permanent veto on changes in Ulster's constitutional status. Both sides confirmed that the essence of any agreement would be a move by the Republic to replace its constitutional claim to the province with the aspiration of a united Ireland. Britain in return would offer a significant extension of cross-border administration. But the communique glossed over significant differences on the extent to which elements of the Hume-Adams peace initiative could be incorporated into their own negotiations. Mr Reynolds told Mr Major that the two sides could not ignore the potential for a cessation of violence by the IRA in return for a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein. But, speaking after their talks, Mr Major told journalists that there could be 'no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those who use, threaten or support violence'. Nor could there be any secret agreements or understandings with Sinn Fein or the IRA. Despite their new determination to fill the political vacuum in which the terrorists have flourished, the two leaders also acknowledged that an intergovernmental agreement would not be enough in itself to bring peace.
19931030000000000	FT  30 OCT 93 / Ulster peace process role possible for Sinn Fein: London and Dublin would 'respond imaginatively' if IRA ends violence. THE BRITISH and Irish governments last night signalled that Sinn Fein could be brought into the Northern Ireland peace process in return for a permanent end to IRA terrorism. Their statement came as Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds responded to the escalating violence in the province by announcing a new drive towards a political settlement. A joint communique issued by the two leaders after talks in Brussels said there could be no question of contacts with terrorists, but that 'new doors' would open if the IRA and its supporters renounced violence for good. In his most explicit recognition yet of a potential role for Sinn Fein, Mr Major agreed that the political wing of the IRA could eventually be brought into the peace process. The two governments said they would 'respond imaginatively' to a permanent cessation of violence. However, the British and Irish prime ministers rejected as a basis for peace the conclusions of recent talks between Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no question' of the two governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of the dialogue. Details of those talks were reported yesterday for the first time to Mr Major by Mr Reynolds. At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the 'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'.

19931029000000000	FT  29 OCT 93 / Major to support fresh N Ireland peace initiative: London and Dublin hope to sideline Hume-Adams talks. MR JOHN MAJOR and Mr Albert Reynolds will back a new political initiative today to bring peace in Northern Ireland based on secret talks between the London and Dublin governments. The two leaders will consider joint proposals for a new constitutional settlement which includes fundamental changes to the Irish constitution and the creation of a number of powerful executive boards to increase cross-border co-operation. They are determined to regain the initiative at the end of a week of escalating violence, which started last Saturday with an IRA bomb which killed 10 people in the mainly Protestant Shankill Road. The bloodshed continued last night with the shooting dead of two Catholic brothers, aged 18 and 20, in the living room of their home at Bleary, near Warringstown, Co Down. Loyalists were blamed for the murders. The proposals, drafted in outline over recent weeks by a working party of civil servants from London and Dublin, would provide an 'umbrella' for the restart of negotiations between political parties in the province. The move is also designed to sideline the parallel talks between Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, and persuade the parties to talk again. Dublin, however, wants some of the Hume-Adams proposals included in a broader settlement. The outcome of today's meeting, at the margins of the European summit in Brussels, may not be spelled out in detail given the political sensitivity of the peace process. But they will form the basis for more talks next week between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. The 'guiding principles' for any agreement, set out this week in the Dublin parliament by Mr Spring, received a strong positive response from London yesterday. Officials stress that the provisions of this fresh joint Irish-UK initiative would only come into effect as part of an overall settlement. That in turn would depend on agreement between the SDLP and the Unionist parties on the shape of internal political arrangements in the province to replace government from Westminster. Both sides acknowledge that considerable obstacles remain. But at the heart of any intergovernmental settlement would be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland with an aspiration to achieve a united Ireland. It return Britain would formally acknowledge the legitimacy of that aspiration and would agree to the establishment of a number of cross-border executive boards in such areas as transport, dealings with the European Community's social funds and tourism. Mr Spring's clear declaration that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland was essential for any change in the status of the province was warmly welcomed in Downing Street. Mr Major told MPs he looked forward to discussing the 'positive' proposals with Mr Reynolds. There was acknowledgment in Whitehall that the peace process drawn up by Mr Hume and Mr Adams still presents political hazards for any intergovernmental settlement. Mr Reynolds, who is expected to outline the Hume-Adams plan in today's meeting, believes some elements could be incorporated into an agreement between the two governments. Dublin also believes it must take seriously the prospect of an IRA ceasefire.
19931028000000000	FT  28 OCT 93 / Ulster committee wins new backing. THE COMMONS moved closer to establishing a select committee on Northern Ireland yesterday when its procedure committee decided to examine how such a body might be composed. The Labour party, which was opposed to re-opening the controversial issue, accused the government of doing a secret deal with the Ulster unionists, who have long favoured the setting up of a select committee to scrutinise the work of the Northern Ireland Office. Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee, made clear his support for a select committee urging the government 'to look at our report and act on it'. The report, first drafted in 1990, supported the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at the appropriate time. Mr Tony Banks, a Labour member of the procedure committee, said the Conservatives wanted a Northern Ireland select committee as part of their 'pay-off' to the Ulster unionists who helped the government avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. The Irish government is dismayed by the possibility that the British parliament might set up such a committee. Meanwhile, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, stressed that there was 'no question of simply adopting or endorsing the report of the Hume-Adams dialogue'. His comments yesterday are likely to be welcomed by Downing Street. The UK government has continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Mr Reynolds praised Mr Hume for his efforts to start a peace process, but said it needed a wider base. The prospects of the Hume-Adams plan being accepted by the UK government further receded yesterday after Mr Adams helped to carry the coffin of Thomas Begley, the IRA bomber who died in the Shankill Road fish shop blast at the weekend. Unionists and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, attacked Mr Adams's action. Mr Hume yesterday defended his talks with Mr Adams, saying that he had taken a risk in difficult circumstances. Although the Hume-Adams proposals for peace will be discussed tomorrow at a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, the prime minister, both governments now appear to be more interested in reviving the stalled 'three-strand' talks under the auspices of Sir Patrick. A soldier was charged last night with the attempted murder of Mr Eddie Copeland, a leading Republican, outside Mr Begley's home. Mr Copeland was among mourners outside the Begley home in the Republican Ardoyne area of Belfast when he was hit in the stomach by a bullet.
19931221000000000	FT  21 DEC 93 / Ulster peace hopes set back by amnesty demand: Sinn Fein call for release of prisoners angers Unionists. Hopes of peace in Northern Ireland were jolted yesterday when Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, called for all IRA prisoners to be released from jail as part of a negotiated settlement. His demand angered Protestant leaders. One Ulster Unionist MP immediately warned that his party's 'tentative approval' of the Major-Reynolds peace initiative could be withdrawn. The row broke out after Downing Street again rejected an amnesty for IRA prisoners. But officials acknowledged that all prisoners could have their sentences reviewed under standard procedures which took account of their likeliness to re-offend. The dispute came as the IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb explosion which injured a soldier and a civilian in west Belfast last night. It was the first claim of responsibility since the Major-Reynolds declaration. The IRA appears to be signalling there will be no extended Christmas ceasefire before any decision to end violence. The attack followed the explosion of two incendiary devices in London during the evening which police said bore the hallmarks of the IRA. However, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, earlier said the fact that the paramilitaries were considering the implications of the peace process was 'very encouraging'. Speaking in Brussels, where EU foreign ministers yesterday endorsed the Downing Street Declaration, Mr Spring reiterated Dublin's view that 'the whole question of prisoners' would have to be looked at if a permanent cessation of violence was achieved. Seeking to exploit a suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, on Sunday that London might be ready to consider the future of hundreds of IRA prisoners, Mr Adams said a negotiated settlement would 'remove the symptoms as well as the causes of the conflict. 'As part of this it is obvious that all prisoners must be released,' he said. In a strongly worded statement, the Sinn Fein president also criticised Mr Reynolds' weekend warning that the IRA faced a tough security clampdown if it did not respond positively to the peace initiative. 'The issuing of ultimatums by London and Dublin while we are considering their document is most unhelpful,' he said. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said he was 'not at all impressed' by Mr Adams' statement and warned the two governments not to 'hand hostages to fortune' to the IRA. He said: 'We thought the joint declaration . . . was a definitive statement  -with all its shortcomings we accepted it on that basis. If we are going to go beyond the joint declaration . . . then of course there will be a very quick withdrawal of that tentative approval that has been given by the majority of people in Northern Ireland.' The government's response was welcomed by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, who said on BBC radio there could be no question of an amnesty for convicted criminals. If the government reneged on that 'they would be destroying the whole authority of the judicial system'. The incendiary devices in central London were at a pub in Victoria, which forced the evacuation of hundreds of passengers from the Victoria coach station, and at the Royal Mail's Mount Pleasant sorting office, just north of the City. Nobody was injured. A third device, found at a City sorting office, was made safe.
19931027000000000	FT  27 OCT 93 / Major to discuss Ulster peace move. THE Hume-Adams proposals for peace in Northern Ireland will be discussed on Friday by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, it emerged yesterday. The meeting was confirmed against a background of rising violence in Belfast in the wake of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Protestant Shankill Road, which killed 10 people. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he expected both prime ministers to give the Hume-Adams initiative 'very serious attention on Friday to see where the process can go from here'. But Mr Major's determination not to alienate the Ulster Unionist party was last night reflected by signs at Westminster that the government was now ready to back unionist demands for the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. The prime minister has denied that he did a deal with the Ulster Unionists to avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. But with the tacit backing of Downing Street, the Commons procedure committee is expected today to give a positive response to demands for a select committee. Such a move would represent a clear signal of the government's commitment to ensure that any settlement in the province would have to secure the whole-hearted backing of the protestant community. Extra troops and police were moved to Belfast from elsewhere in Northern Ireland yesterday after two Roman Catholics were killed and six wounded in two separate incidents. Mr Major told the Commons the perpetrators of this week's terrorist attacks would be 'hunted down and subjected to the full severity of the law'. However, the government ruled out the reintroduction of internment. Sir John Wheeler, the Northern Ireland security minister, said there were 'no simple, easy solutions'. Downing Street continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Officials said Mr Major was willing to talk to Mr Reynolds, but was more interested in reviving the stalled 'three-strand' talks under the auspices of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. In an indication of the sensitivity with which the issue is regarded in London, Downing Street said neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds had asked for a bilateral meeting in Brussels. British officials said the Brussels summit offered a 'useful opportunity' for a meeting, but stressed that there was no formal agenda. Downing Street also continued to maintain that Mr Major had not seen the Hume-Adams proposals, and was unaware of the details of the initiative. Irish officials said the Shankill Road bombing had 'seriously damaged' the Hume-Adams initiative, but Dublin appeared keen to keep the proposals alive. Mr Spring said the two governments had an 'obligation' to look at 'any opportunities' to bring about peace in Northern Ireland 'despite the (IRA) atrocity of last weekend'.
19931026000000000	FT  26 OCT 93 / Major rules out deal with IRA on ceasefire: Adams banned from entering Britain - Mayhew condemns 'sickening hypocrisy'. THE British government angrily rejected last night a proposal from Mr Gerry Adams for a conditional IRA ceasefire and announced the Sinn Fein leader had been banned from entering Great Britain. It accused Mr Adams of 'sickening hypocrisy' and set an unconditional and permanent end to violence as a precondition for the IRA and its supporters to be brought into any negotiations on the future of Ulster. The message was reinforced by the announcement that Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, had signed an indefinite exclusion order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The order - signed before the latest IRA bombing in Belfast - prevents the Sinn Fein leader from travelling from Ulster to any other part of the UK. As the weekend killing of Protestant civilians in Belfast's Shankill Road was followed by a bomb attack on a mainland railway line, Mr John Major came close to dismissing the initiative drawn up with Mr Adams by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. But the government was careful not to extend its denunciation to Mr Hume's role in preparing the proposals. Last night Protestant terrorists claimed responsibility for the murder of a Catholic in North Belfast. Earlier a Catholic taxi-driver died in hospital after a revenge shooting in response to the Shankill Road bombing. Mr Adams told the BBC a positive response from the London government to the Hume-Adams proposals could bring an IRA ceasefire. But at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major retorted: 'I am not going to do deals with people who plant bombs and kill innocent people.' That view was echoed in the House of Commons by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, as the latest IRA attacks brought universal condemnation from government and opposition MPs. In a sombre denunciation of the Belfast bombing - which killed nine Protestant civilians as well as one of the terrorists - Sir Patrick said: 'Next to the sickening quality of what was done to people in the Shankill on Saturday has been the sickening quality of the hypocrisy of Mr Adams.' The condition for dialogue with Sinn Fein and the IRA was an end to violence 'without condition and forever'. The Northern Ireland secretary, however, 'saluted' Mr Hume for his courage in seeking a settlement. Senior ministers said they saw no real prospect of the Hume-Adams proposals' leading to a lasting settlement, but could not afford to reject them out of hand before they had been formally presented by Dublin. Mr Hume said the British government could not afford to reject a set of proposals which had as their objective a 'lasting peace and total cessation of violence'. But Mr Major underlined the gulf between the two sides by accusing Mr Adams of blackmail: 'If Mr Adams can end the violence then he should end the violence now without preconditions, without any delay . . . and without any proposals which sound to me tantamount to blackmail.' Sir Patrick's Commons statement was quickly followed by the announcement of the exclusion order against Mr Adams. The announcement from Mr Howard - who signed the order last Tuesday - said that Mr Adams was or is concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism connected with Northern Ireland. The decision came after reports that the Sinn Fein leader was planning to visit Great Britain at the invitation of Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP. The rail network in southern England was in chaos after the IRA detonated a bomb on the main line from London to the west of England. Two bombs were placed in Reading, one of which exploded several hours after the first had been successfully defused. Police said the second blast had been calculated to kill workers from the emergency services responding to a coded warning of the first attack. Explosions cause rail chaos in south, Page 8 Joe Rogaly, Page 18
19931025000000000	FT  25 OCT 93 / Bomb puts Ulster peace talks in doubt. THE Hume-Adams initiative to end the fighting in Northern Ireland appeared doomed last night as Mr John Major led a fierce denunciation of the IRA's bombing of a busy Belfast street. As the death toll from Saturday's attack in the Protestant Shankill Road rose to 10, including one of the terrorists who planted the bomb, Mr Major ruled out early dialogue with the Republican Sinn Fein movement. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, announced they had postponed a meeting of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference on Wednesday. Mr Spring had been expected at that meeting to pass on to Sir Patrick details of the Hume-Adams plan. Sir Patrick is expected to make a House of Commons statement later today. British ministers expect that the London and Dublin governments will now press ahead with their own efforts to devise a new constitutional settlement to provide an umbrella for fresh talks between the legitimate political parties in the province. In the wake of Saturday's massacre Ulster Unionists demanded an end to the so-called peace initiative framed by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume called on the two governments to speed up their consideration of the proposals, which he said offered the best hope in 20 years of ending sectarian violence in the province. However, Mr Major, who is expected to hold talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, during Friday's European Community summit in Brussels, said the bombing had seriously undermined hopes for dialogue. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major said he wanted one message from the IRA: 'We have given up violence for good.' He added: 'The message I want to hear is quite clear. It is quite simple. But I haven't heard it yet.' Apparently dismissing the Hume-Adams proposals, the prime minister said: 'I have read about it, I have heard about it, but I have not seen it.' Senior ministers added the bombing had reduced to 'practically zero' the already slim prospect that Mr Hume's efforts could lead to participation by Sinn Fein in talks to secure a political settlement in Ulster. One member of the cabinet said the government would be accused - and rightly so - of bowing to the terrorists if it opened contacts with an organisation which explicitly supported IRA terrorism. Mr Reynolds said the bombing was another atrocity which showed that the path of violence led nowhere. He said: 'All sides, even at this late stage, must desist from killing and allow the dialogue to develop between those who believe in peace.' Mr Adams said last night that the bombing had been 'wrong' after the IRA indicated that it had intended to give a warning before the bomb was detonated, but that it had exploded prematurely.
19931220000000000	FT  20 DEC 93 / Reynolds warns IRA of crackdown: Irish PM will help UK over security if peace moves fail. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday warned he would help Britain impose a tough security clamp-down against the IRA if it did not respond positively to the two governments' bid to bring peace to Northern Ireland. As Mr Reynolds sought to put further pressure on the IRA to give up its 25-year armed struggle against Britain's presence in Ulster, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, appealed to Ulster unionists to recognise the initiative as the last chance for peace. Mr Reynolds warned on BBC radio that both governments 'would be expected to respond' if loyalists and nationalists resumed the path of violence: 'After a period in which such strong support has been expressed by the people in both communities for peace, I think there would be revulsion over a resumption of full-scale violence,' he said. Mr Reynolds ruled out a return to internment for terrorist suspects, which he said was 'the strongest recruiting platform that the IRA were handed'. It seems increasingly unlikely that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will deliver an early response to the two governments' declaration last Wednesday. An indication of Sinn Fein's position came from Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, speaking after talks yesterday with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume said he believed Mr Adams was 'very serious' about peace in the region. In the Sunday Tribune newspaper in Dublin, Mr Adams said: 'Republicans will be considering (the joint declaration) in the context of Sinn Fein's peace strategy. We will approach it positively and seek to move the peace strategy forward.' The Republican movement, he said, would consider the declaration 'over Christmas and for some time after that . . . There are no quick fixes in this situation'. However, a bomb explosion in Londonderry yesterday showed the IRA was not committed to an unofficial ceasefire while deciding what action to take. Three children and two adults narrowly escaped being killed in the blast, which was the first attack since Wednesday's Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds tempered his warning about a security clampdown with hints of benefits to the IRA if it sued for peace. He also suggested London might negotiate over 'the future of prisoners' held in British jails: 'I think that's what the British government would have in mind in exploratory talks with Sinn Fein which they said would be within three months.' Downing Street officials said that the subject of prisoners was not among initial proposals for talks with Sinn Fein in the aftermath of a ceasefire. A Downing Street spokeswoman emphasised that British jails contained 'criminals' not 'political prisoners'. Unionist politicians also warned that they would oppose any amnesty for IRA prisoners as part of an overall deal. Mr Major's appeal to Northern Ireland's Unionists to accept the peace initiative, in an article for the Belfast newspaper, Sunday Life, said the joint initiative did not undermine the union between Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr Major said: 'I support the union. I have always supported the union. That is my personal right.' However he went on: 'But I shall not seek to impose my view on the greater number of people of Northern Ireland if they decide otherwise.' Prisoners' pivotal role, Page 6
19931217000000000	FT  17 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein reaction keeps hopes of Ulster peace alive. Hopes of peace in Northern Ireland were kept alive yesterday when Sinn Fein said it would take time to consider in detail its response to this week's peace initiative by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. As the British government sought to reassure Unionists at Westminster by giving the go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee, Mr Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing, said he was still 'personally and politically' committed to helping secure peace in Northern Ireland. But he warned there were 'no quick fixes' to the province's problems. His statement reflected the difficulties the Republican movement is having in co-ordinating a response to the prime minister's main demand that the IRA should lay down its arms. It is understood that an early meeting between senior Sinn Fein officials and members of the IRA on Wednesday failed to produce an agreed response to the joint declaration. The final decision is in the hands of the IRA's Army Council which is understood not to have met in full session on the issue. Mr Adams said the Downing Street declaration was the product of 'frenzied activity' by the two governments after his talks with Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, had 'focused them on this issue'. He would be seeking clarification from Dublin on some aspects of Wednesday's statement by the UK and Irish prime ministers. At Westminster, Mr Major came under pressure from his own back benches over whether the declaration diluted the government's commitment to the Union. In an acid exchange, he clashed with Mr Norman Lamont over the former chancellor's assertion that the declaration stood 'a little oddly' with his speech to the Conservative party conference in October. In contrast to the cross-party plaudits for the government on Wednesday, there were further backbench rumblings in the wake of a signal from Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, that the government might begin talks with Sinn Fein without waiting for the IRA to hand in its weapons. One Tory MP accused the government of giving in to terrorists. Downing Street said the select committee decision - announced yesterday by Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader - was not related to the Anglo-Irish declaration on Northern Ireland, which was 'on a separate track'. Officials said the decision - which was not communicated in advance to Mr Reynolds or Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader - was taken by Mr Newton after consultation with Mr Major and Sir Patrick. The IRA last night claimed responsibility for two bombs discovered earlier by the track near Brookwood railway station, Surrey. Army teams blew up the packages at the station. London hints at early start to talks, Page 9 Joe Rogaly, Page 18
19931214000000000	FT  14 DEC 93 / PM says any accord must be 'balanced'. Mr John Major acknowledged yesterday that a Anglo-Irish declaration designed to restore peace to Northern Ireland would have to balance guarantees to unionists with recognition of the aspirations of the province's nationalists. As British officials suggested that he might yet hold a third meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as early as tomorrow, Mr Major told MPs they were seeking a declaration that would end IRA terrorism. Despite a fierce warning from the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, of a Protestant backlash, Mr Major said both premiers wanted a 'balanced' declaration. His comments appeared to signal that the government is ready to give some ground to demands from Mr Reynolds that Dublin's acceptance of a unionist veto must be accompanied by language in the statement which would have a reasonable chance of securing a cessation of IRA violence. Mr Major appeared to shift further in that direction with his explicit acknowledgement during comments on the weekend IRA murder of two policemen that he was looking for 'a circumstance that will end such murders in future'. It is thought that the talks inched forward during the course of the day. An Irish government spokesman said last night that the two prime ministers would be in touch by phone this morning to review progress and to try to agree the date for their third meeting in as many weeks. Mr Major said he could offer no guarantee that a declaration would be agreed before parliament breaks for the Christmas recess on Friday, and it was still possible that the talks would break down. But Downing Street aides said a further meeting would take place before Christmas. Mr Paisley warned that the price demanded by the IRA was 'too high'. Another warning was delivered by a leading member of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein's Ulster executive, said that if the opportunity of peace was 'squandered', Northern Ireland could face civil war.
19931213000000000	FT  13 DEC 93 / Irish rivals both aim at Major: Disquiet surfaces in Dublin as Ulster unionists threaten to withdraw parliamentary backing. Mr John Major last night faced conflicting pressures from the Dublin government and the Ulster unionists as the weekend murder by the IRA of two Northern Ireland policemen cast a shadow over the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that after their Brussels' meeting he had agreed with Mr Major some '70 per cent' of the proposed joint statement they hope might persuade the IRA to end violence. That raised expectations that two leaders could hold a further meeting this week to clear the remaining obstacles. Officials from both governments worked through the weekend on the text and Mr Major and Mr Reynolds plan to speak on the phone later today to assess progress. As Mr Major consulted cabinet colleagues, Downing Street still appeared hopeful of a pre-Christmas accord. But the Irish prime minister warned he was not prepared to sign an anodyne declaration which would not offer a reasonable prospect of a permanent cessation of violence. Amid pessimism in Dublin on the prospects for a substantive statement, Mr Reynolds said that guarantees for the Protestant majority in Ulster had to be balanced by recognition of the nationalist aspirations of a large minority. The key differences now centre on the issues of self-determination and on Dublin's proposal for an all-Ireland convention, involving all political parties north and south. Mr Reynolds signalled in Brussels that he could accept a statement which did not explicitly endorse the 'value' of eventual unity. But Dublin's acceptance of a unionist veto over any change in Ulster's status had to be set in the wider context of Irish self-determination. Irish government officials reaffirmed yesterday that Mr Reynolds 'will not sign a statement that will not achieve the result of a cessation of violence'. If agreement could not be reached, a final pre-Christmas summit was unlikely. The two governments' task in attempting to square the circle between unionist fears and nationalist terrorism was underlined by a blunt warning from two leading members of the Ulster Unionist party directed at Mr Major. Mr John Taylor, MP for Stangford, said any move towards a united Ireland would prompt his party to threaten the government's majority by opposing it in any vote of confidence. Mr David Trimble, MP for Upper Bann, accused Mr Reynolds of 'effectively acting on behalf of the IRA'. He said Mr Reynolds, by taking on the Hume-Adams proposals, was talking about 'surrender by stages' to the IRA. He rejected any concessions to Mr Reynolds's proposals and ruled out the possibility of agreeing to a peace conference representing all parties in the republic and Northern Ireland. But Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, repeated his call for Irish self-determination. He said acceptance of the need for majority consent in Northern Ireland had to be seen as an interim part of a process towards national self-determination. Meanwhile Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said that the IRA had nothing to offer Northern Ireland except death and suffering. His comments came after two police officers were shot dead by IRA gunmen at Five-miletown in Fermanagh. Several people were arrested.
19931130000000000	FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Extracts from the talks - the British government's version. JANUARY 11 1993: Sir Patrick Mayhew says that pressure within the IRA for an end to violence is mounting FEBRUARY 22: Oral message from Provisional Movement leaders: The conflict is over but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close. We wish to have an unannounced ceasefire in order to hold dialogue leading to peace. We cannot announce such a move as it will lead to confusion for the volunteers because the press will misinterpret it as a surrender. We cannot meet secretary of state's public renunciation of violence, but it would be given privately as long as we were sure that we were not being tricked. FEBRUARY 26: Warrington bomb explodes gasworks. A British government message: We understand and appreciate the seriousness of what has been said. We wish to take it seriously and at face value. That will of course be influenced by events on the ground over the coming days and weeks . . . It is not possible to give a substantive reply immediately. MARCH 5: Message from Provisional leaders: We would like two representatives, Martin McGuinness and Gerry Kelly, to have an exploratory meeting with you as soon as possible. MARCH 7: IRA bomb injures 4 policemen in Bangor MARCH 11: British message: In the light of the continued violence of recent days since the first response we are not yet able to send a substantive response. MARCH 19: British message: 1. The importance of what has been said, the wish to take it seriously, and the influence of events on the ground, have been acknowledged. 2. It is essential that there should be no deception on either side. 3. The position of the British government on dealing with those who espouse violence is clearly understood . . . We confirm that if violence had genuinely been brought to an end, whether or not that fact had been announced, then dialogue could take place. 4. Once a halt to activity became public, the government would have to acknowledge and defend its entry into dialogue. It would do so by pointing out that its agreement to exploratory dialogue . . . had been given because . . . it had received a private assurance that organised violence had been brought to an end. 5. The British government has made clear that: No political objective which is advocated by constitutional means alone could properly be excluded from discussion. The commitment to return as much responsibility as possible to local politicians should be seen within a wider framework. New political arrangements would be designed to ensure that no legitimate group was excluded from eligibility to share in the exercise of this responsibility. In the event of a genuine and established ending of violence, the whole range of responses to it would inevitably be looked at afresh. 6. The British government . . . wants to see included in this process all main parties which have sufficiently shown they genuinely do not espouse violence. 7. The British government cannot enter a talks process . . . with the purpose of achieving a predetermined outcome. It has accepted that the eventual outcome of such a process could be a united Ireland, but only on the basis of the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. But unless the people of Northern Ireland come to express such a view, the British government will continue to uphold the union. 8. Evidence on the ground that any group had ceased violent activity would induce resulting reduction of security force activity. 9. It is important to establish whether this provides a basis for the way forward. We are ready to answer specific questions or to give further explanation. MARCH 20: Warrington bomb explodes in shopping centre. MARCH 22: Oral message from Provisional leaders: The last thing we needed at this sensitive time was what has happened. It is the fate of history that we find ourselves in this position, all we can think of at this time is an old Irish proverb: 'God's hand works in mysterious ways.' Our hope is that this hand will lead to peace and friendship. APRIL 10: SDLP leader John Hume meets Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams. APRIL 24: Bishopsgate bomb explodes in City of London. MAY 10: Message from Provisonal leaders: We welcome face-to-face exchanges with your representative . . . We wish now to proceed without delay to the delegation meetings . . . We would like to nominate someone to liaise with Martin McGuinness on this. We also have a number of questions: (a) Who will represent you? (b) When will the British government be politically represented in this process and by whom? (c) We need clarification of the phrase 'progressive entry into dialogue'. (d) When will this start? (e) Where is the proposed venue? It would be more practical and quicker if these details could be agreed directly with Mr McGuinness. UK government note: The 'face-to-face exchanges with your representative' referred to in the first sentence was the unauthorised meeting between Mr McGuinness and a British official. MAY 20: 1,000lb bomb explodes in Belfast, injuring 20. JUNE 1: Message from Provisional leaders: The Provisional leadership is dismayed that it has not yet received a formal reply to its offer. JULY 22: Message from Provisional leadership: 4. British sovereignty over the six counties, as with all of Ireland before partition, is the inherent cause of political instability and conflict. This must be addressed. 5. We seek to assist the establishment of, and to support, a process which . . . culminates in . . . the end of your jurisdiction. 6. We believe that the wish of the majority of the Irish people is for Irish unity. 7. Your disavowal of any prior objective is contradicted by your commitment to uphold the unionist veto. The consequence of upholding the veto is, in effect, to set as your objective maintenance of partition and the six-county statelet . . . The potentially historic opportunity which this represents for the cause of peace in Ireland should not be lost. We have outlined our position. You have outlined yours. It is now time to move on. You should arrange for us to do so as speedily as possible. JULY 17: British message: There was no ulterior motive in any delay . . . Although it was absolutely clear from the attacks which took place in March that events on the ground could halt progress, these attacks following the May elections went ahead . . . Does the ending of conflict remain your objective, and is there a way forward? JULY 23: Major wins vote of confidence. AUGUST 14: Message from Provisional leadership: You asserted the belief that a two-week suspension to accommodate talks would result in republicans being persuaded that there is no further need for armed struggle. Because of our commitment to a lasting settlement . . . we sought and received a commitment to facilitate that step. You failed to grasp that opportunity. As for events on the ground. The greatest number of fatalities for some time now in the conflict have resulted from the actions of loyalist groups acting both on their own agenda and as surrogates for British intelligence . . . SEPTEMBER 3: British message: The importance of clear mutual understanding has already been recognised. Minds do not seem to be meeting at the moment. This needs to be over-come. The note you sent on August 14 did not . . . confirm that you envisage a peace process which is aimed at an inclusive political process and that a lasting end to violence does not depend on your analysis being endorsed as the only way forward . . . On a further point in it, the government side has not asserted a belief that a two-week suspension would have the result described . . . Can you confirm that you want a peace process which is aimed at an inclusive political process and that a lasting end to violence does not depend on your analysis being endorsed as the only way forward? OCTOBER 23: IRA bomb in Protestant Shankhill Road kills 10 inlcuding one bomber. OCTOBER 27: Gerry Adams helps carry the bomber's coffin. OCTOBER 29: John Major and Albert Reynolds set out six guiding principles for a settlement at Brussels summit. OCTOBER 30: Seven murdered by loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters in Greysteel. NOVEMBER 2: Message from Provisional leaders: This problem cannot be solved by the Reynolds-Spring situation, although they're part of it. You appear to have rejected the Hume-Adams situation though they too are part of it . . . Now we can't even have dialogue to work out how a total end to all violence can come about. We believe that the country could be at the point of no return. In plain language please tell us though as a matter of urgency when you will open dialogue in the event of a total end to hostilities. We believe that if all the documents involved are put on the table - including your nine-paragrapher and our May 10 - that we have the basis of an understanding. NOVEMBER 5: British message: 1. Your message of November 2 is taken as being of the greatest importance and significance. 2. We hold to what was said jointly and in public by the prime minister and the Taoiseach in Brussels on October 29. A copy of the statement is annexed. 3. Any dialogue could only follow a permanent end to violent activity. 4. If, as you have offered, you were to give us an unequivocal assurance that violence has indeed been brought to a permanent end, and that accordingly Sinn Fein is now committed to political progress by peaceful and democratic means alone, we will make clear publicly our commitment to enter exploratory dialogue with you. Our public statement will make clear that, provided your private assurance is promptly confirmed publicly after our public statement and that events on the ground are fully consistent with this, a first meeting for exploratory dialogue will take place within a week of parliament's return in January. 5. Exploratory dialogue will have the following purposes: (i) To explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to be admitted to an inclusive political talks process . . . but without anticipating the negotiations within that process. (ii) To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a period to play the same part as the current constitutional parties in the public life of Northern Ireland. (iii) To examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence. 6. The attached Annex summarises the sequence of events and provides answers to the procedural questions concerning exploratory dialogue which have been raised. 7. If, in advance of our public statement, any public statement is made on your behalf which appears to us inconsistent with this basis for proceeding it would not be possible for us then to proceed. 8. If we receive the necessary assurance, which you have offered, that violence has been brought to an end, we shall assume that you are assenting to the basis for proceeding explained in this note and its attachment. The procedural annexe included the following points: 2. The sequence of events would be as follows: (i) There is an unequivocal private assurance that violence has been brought to a permanent end, and accordingly that Sinn Fein has affirmed that it is henceforth committed to political progress by peaceful and democratic means alone. (ii) Soon after receiving the necessary satisfactory assurance, and on the assumption that events on ground are consistent with this assurance, we will make a public statement indicating our agreement in principle to enter exploratory dialogue in January provided the private assurance is promptly confirmed publicly and continues to be demonstrated on the ground. (iii) If a genuine end to violence is brought about within the next few days, a first meeting for exploratory dialogue would take place within a week of parliament's return in January. 3. At the first meeting of exploratory dialogue each party could field up to three delegates to be seated at the table. The possible need for the additional presence of advisers on each side is something which could be addressed at the logistical meeting. 4. It is for each party to decide who should represent it at this and at subsequent meetings . . . It is assumed that each party will wish its representatives to have the seniority appropriate to its authorised representatives. The British side will be represented by senior officials acting under political authority and direction . . .
19931120000000000	FT  20 NOV 93 / Major's risky crusade: The UK prime minister's Ulster initiative. One of the more cruel truths of Northern Ireland is that politics has long favoured the status quo. No matter how vicious the violence, post-war governments on both sides of the Irish Sea have never been threatened by a failure to restore peace. Instead politicians in London have been mesmerised by the dangers of undercutting the Protestant, unionist majority. Irish leaders have looked over their shoulder at the nationalist aspirations of the Republic. In Belfast, the constitutional parties - Protestant and Roman Catholic - have felt safer with the status quo than with the risks of a new political settlement. Mr John Major this week declared it was time to end that depressing paralysis. After weeks of intensive contacts between London and Dublin he put Northern Ireland at the top of his personal agenda. He is ready to table his own comprehensive proposals for devolved government in Ulster and a re-definition of the relationships between Britain and the Republic, and between north and south. He made explicit the offer of a place in negotiations for Sinn Fein if the IRA called a permanent halt to their terrorist campaign. He said he was aiming for peace as well as a political settlement. He warned the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev Ian Paisley it could not exercise a veto. Senior British officials said that all sides would have to make uncomfortable compromises. Mr Major, jolted by the terrorist atrocities which began with last month's IRA bombing of Belfast's Protestant Shankill Road, was ready to do so. He is confident of his own skills as a conciliator and negotiator. He is spending more time on Northern Ireland than on any other subject. Not everyone thinks it is a wise decision. The high-profile approach is described variously in Whitehall as naive and dangerous, as well as courageous. His advisers say he knows it is a high-risk strategy. Old Ulster hands regard that as a understatement. Mr Major sees the rewards as well as the risks. An end to the killing after 25 bloody years would be the ultimate prize. But even a political deal which fell short of that would do much to restore his authority. A discernible mood for peace on both sides of the Irish border, however, cannot of itself untie the knot which has wrecked past initiatives. Nor will it erase centuries of mistrust. Mr Major must find the elusive formula which reassures the unionist majority they retain a veto over constitutional change and recognises the nationalist aspirations of the Republic and the Catholic minority in Ulster. So at the kernel of any agreement there must be a willingness on Dublin's part to modify its constitutional claim to sovereignty, and a recognition by unionists that the Republic has a legitimate interest in the way the north is governed. None of this is new. Some of these realities are incorporated into the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Mr Garret Fitzgerald, the then Irish prime minister, offered in 1984 to submit to a referendum the offending articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution. Lady Thatcher did not believe he could deliver and the idea was abandoned. Mr Major believes the mood has changed. He trusts Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart. British officials say the two have a rapport. But as a leak of Dublin's draft proposals for a settlement revealed, the price it is demanding for renunciation of the South's territorial claim is still too high for Unionists. Though the words 'joint sovereignty' never appear, the idea suffuses the document. That runs straight into the unionists' determination to preserve the province's present status. Here the pivotal figure is Mr James Molyneaux, the 73-year-old leader of the Ulster Unionists. Mr Major is ready to accept that Mr Paisley's DUP may boycott talks. But the prime minister cannot get anywhere without the support of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs. Much has been made of the deal struck by the prime minister and Mr Molyneaux to secure the ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the summer. But the foundations of Mr Molyneaux's authority runs much deeper. Mr Major, a self-declared unionist, cannot agree anything without the consent of the Protestant majority. Mr Molyneaux' veto is cast-iron. So far he has kept his counsel on Mr Major's initiatives. But some suspect he expects the process to founder. Mr Major might then have to accept unionists' agenda for integrating the province more fully into the UK. Mr John Hume of the mainly Catholic SDLP has a different sort of veto. His joint initiative with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein was rejected in both Dublin and London. But to the discomfort of Mr Major, Mr Reynolds has taken on board the idea that peace is an essential ingredient of any political settlement. No Irish government can disown the SDLP Then there is Sinn Fein. British intelligence reports suggest Mr Adams may be serious about extricating the IRA from violence. But there is no certainty and many risks. There is unease on the Tory backbenches about 'concessions' to terrorists. One minister warned that, if Mr Major leans too far towards Sinn Fein, the resultant split in the Tory party would make Maastricht seem a 'tea party'. In the past few weeks London and Dublin have cleared some of the historical debris strewn across the path to peace. But for all his determination Mr Major has no idea yet whether he has set off along another cul de sac.
19931109000000000	FT  09 NOV 93 / Debate over IRA ceasefire puts peace plan under strain. THE Major-Reynolds Northern Ireland peace initiative was under strain last night after fundamental differences emerged between London and Dublin on the timing of a permanent IRA ceasefire. Downing Street responded sharply to suggestions by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that peace could be achieved by Christmas if the two governments focused on a cessation of violence followed by talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Officials said Mr John Major had ruled out 'secret agreements on a ceasefire with violent organisations', and was 'wary of false optimism' in Dublin. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, suggested the timetable outlined by Mr Reynolds could hinder the peace process. 'I don't think that this is a process that will benefit from governments saying that this must be achieved in a fortnight, or that must be achieved in a month,' he said. Sir Patrick tried to minimise the significance of the differences between Mr Reynolds and Mr Major by insisting that it was 'a mistake to look for evidence of disagreement between the two governments. There is none'. Mr Reynolds responded swiftly to the British comments. He said in a statement that 'peace cannot wait'. He added: 'Time is not on our side.' The exchanges reflect simmering differences between London and Dublin over the framework for the peace process, which was launched by the two governments in Brussels two weeks ago. Britain wants round-table discussions involving the two governments and Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties, which are in the middle of bilateral talks with Mr Major. The British government insists that Sinn Fe'in should be included in the talks only after a permanent and unconditional cessation of IRA violence. The Irish government favours a separate peace process in which talks would focus on achieving an IRA ceasefire, followed by the inclusion of Sinn Fein in talks. Irish support for this strategy has hardened since the annual conference of the governing Fianna Fail party at the weekend revealed strong grass roots support for peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. However, the Hume-Adams proposals, which called for a ceasefire followed by talks with Sinn Fein, have been rejected by the British government. Sir Patrick repeated the British approach yesterday in the House Magazine, a journal produced for MPs, saying: 'The government will never negotiate with those who support threaten or perpetrate violence, or who fail to show their disavowal of such evil is for real.' Three men were remanded in custody by a special court in Limavady, Co Londonderry, charged with the murders of seven people shot dead 10 days ago in the Rising Sun bar in nearby Greysteel. They were also charged with membership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters and with possession of firearms. One was further charged with the murder of four Catholic workmen at Castlerock, Co Londonderry, in March.
19940402000000000	FT  02 APR 94 / Cardinal warns Major against 'rubbishing' IRA ceasefire. Cardinal Cahal Daly yesterday challenged Mr John Major's scornful rejection of the IRA's 72-hour post-Easter ceasefire. 'I believe the opportunity should not be passed by,' Cardinal Daly said. 'It should not be rubbished.' Speaking less than 24 hours after the prime minister denounced the IRA's move as 'self-serving and cynical', the Primate of all Ireland said the ceasefire raised 'significant hope', although it was 'disappointingly short'. 'I am afraid, respectfully, I would not agree that this is a cynical exercise on the part of the IRA,' he added. 'The significance is that for the first time in 20 years they have initiated this cessation of violence. Why not test it?' As the leaders of the three main opposition parties in the Irish republic issued a joint peace demand to the IRA, Archbishop Robin Eames, the Protestant Primate of the Church of Ireland, responded to the ceasefire in a more downbeat vein. Although any cessation was to be welcomed, he said: 'The real Christian agenda for Northern Ireland must be written by those who see that a complete end to violence . . . will give us the opportunity to plan the way forward in peace and justice.' Yesterday's developments came as the British and Irish governments reaffirmed that the ceasefire, starting at midnight on Tuesday, falls far short of the permanent cessation required to admit Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to round-table talks. Sinn Fein has called for 'immediate and direct talks' with the British government to obtain clarification of the Downing Street declaration signed by London and Dublin last December. Dublin has expressed 'extreme disappointment' with the IRA's response to the declaration, with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urging Sinn Fein to spell out what it means by its latest clarification demand. Underlining Dublin's growing exasperation with Sinn Fein, Mr Reynolds has departed for a week-long holiday in Cyprus. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has said he 'would not seek to protract' any talks with the British government and emphasised that Sinn Fein is not seek-ing negotiation, only clarification. An IRA bomb containing 200lbs of explosives and shrapnel was made safe by soldiers in Armagh yesterday after a day-long operation, police said.
19940620000000000	FT  20 JUN 94 / Government pressed to step up Ulster security: Reprisals feared after loyalist gunmen kill six in village bar. The British government was yesterday under pressure to step up security in Northern Ireland after loyalist gunmen shot dead six Roman Catholic men in a bar. The gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons as customers at the crowded bar in the largely Catholic village of Loughinisland in Co Down watched the Republic of Ireland's opening World Cup soccer match on television. Five people were wounded. The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for Saturday night's attack, saying it was in retaliation for last week's shooting of two Protestant men in Belfast. Police were last night braced for further sectarian violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, condemned the killings as 'inhuman savagery' and said the gunmen would achieve 'no political purpose'. He pledged the RUC would never give up the hunt for the attackers. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the incident had brought him close to despair. The attack prompted calls from Tory MPs for the introduction of internment as part of a security clampdown. Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, urged the government to 'lift' 30-40 republican and loyalist terrorist ringleaders. He also called for the deployment of more troops on the province's streets. The attack came less than 48 hours after Mr Spring warned that a framework agreement on new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland was unlikely to be ready for next month's Anglo-Irish summit. However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, are expected to try to give new impetus to the peace effort when they meet at the European Union's summit in Corfu later this week. Mr Eddie McGrady, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for South Down, said he hoped there would be no reprisal of any kind for the shootings. He said anyone attempting retaliation would be 'disowned by all our community and will not be acting on anybody's behalf'. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, cautioned against the reintroduction of internment, likening such a move to 'putting a lid on the cauldron' and saying it would end any prospect of constructive peace talks. The RUC Deputy Chief Constable Blair Wallace said: 'We are in the middle of a series of tit-for-tat killings. They started on Thursday and Friday and this was undoubtedly one of that series.' He said that but for the activities of the security forces there could have been more attacks 'because it is quite clear the terrorists are endeavouring to out-do the other in the enormity of their bloodlust'.
19940910000000000	FT  10 SEP 94 / Will they bid for peace?: The republicans say they have given up violence. But are the unionists buying it? Christian Tyler went to Northern Ireland and asked them. A woman in the little crowd outside the Orange Hall was shouting. 'Is Gerry Adams in there? Is he hiding under Mayhew's raincoat?' Inside the hall, Sir Patrick Mayhew, tall and grey-faced, was making his most important public appearance since the IRA ceasefire. Alternately flattering and firm - and with an apology for past misunderstanding - the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was trying to cajole the distrustful ranks of Protestant brethren who remain convinced their British government is selling out to Sinn Fein and the IRA gunmen after 25 years of bloodshed. The hall was decked with the banners of the Orange lodges for an historic encounter in the town of Comber, County Down, on Wednesday night. About 200 men - and half a dozen women - were packed into an airless upstairs room. Arrayed in the orange stoles and insignia of their Order, they looked honest, decent folk - but implacable. They declared their fears and suppressed their anger as they respectfully applauded the first Secretary of State to come down from Stormont Castle to face the rank and file of Orange Protestant unionism. Before Mayhew's ordeal a minister said prayers and read from St Paul's epistle to the Thessalonians. The Grand Lodge chairman, the eloquent David McNarry, warned against indiscipline on the floor. Sir Patrick was then presented with a handsome bible: and for a moment it seemed he was expected to take the oath on the spot: There Is No Secret Deal. The unionist majority of northern Ireland feels itself the underdog these days, the more so as Sinn Fein reaps the propaganda rewards of its 10-day-old initiative. For many unionist footsoldiers the IRA declaration is a tactical sham, a con-trick. They are suspicious of the republicans, suspicious of Westminster, afraid of being cast as the villains of the piece, afraid of their own triumphalist paramilitaries, and afraid of domination by Dublin - or Rome. Can such people ever make peace? In spite of the universal hope of peace, for many unionists the IRA ceasefire has changed nothing. Asked whether he felt differently now, an old farmer at the Saintfield weekly cattle auction winked roguishly and said: 'No. I had my hair cut last week. It's grown again this week.' Farmers tend to be men of few words. But the buyers clustered at the ringside this week, giving almost undetectable jerks of the thumb to register their bids with the fast-talking auctioneer, constitute the backbone of a dangerously aggrieved majority. William Dick, a pleasant and articulate young beef farmer with 140 acres, is a local councillor from the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. Speaking after Paisley's showdown with John Major at Number 10 this week, he said mainlanders should not make the mistake of thinking that just because Paisley had 'his own way of expressing himself' he did not correctly represent the views of the community. Nor should they forget that in the recent European elections, Paisley's party had topped the Ulster poll. 'We have made our views known, but the unionist viewpoint has been set aside,' he said. 'For the English it is hard to perceive what is going on. At local level we have no trouble getting on with the SDLP (the non-violent republican party led by John Hume) but at national level their demands are hardening all the time.' As for Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein, they had sponsored butchery one week and been received by the Irish Prime Minister the next. 'There has been no word of remorse, no apologies for the deaths.' Even out in the rolling countryside of County Down, most people have been touched by the violence. The last IRA victim before the ceasefire was a friend of Councillor Dick, a part-time member of the Royal Irish Regiment (formerly Ulster Defence Regiment) and church organist called Trelford Withers who was shot at point-blank range in his shop in nearby Crossgar on August 8. Another friend of the murdered man said he belonged to no party but was 'disgusted' by the way the British prime minister had treated Paisley. The rival Ulster Unionists under James Molyneaux were betraying the people, he added, and Sir Patrick Mayhew talked down to them. Then he confessed: 'Our worst enemies now are the loyalist paramilitaries.' The map says Ireland should be one nation. But Protestants behind the north-eastern partition feel different, part of another culture, another history, another tribe. The evidence of their descent is everywhere: in the Scottish names of families, villages and streets, in the Presbyterian churches, in the notices clamped to street lamps which read 'Alcohol-free area'. The people of north Antrim are physically closer to Glasgow than to Dublin. Gerald Douglas, an eighth-generation Scot, is a Toyota dealer under the Mountains of Mourne in the south of Co Down where Catholics predominate. In spite of the ceasefire, he keeps a gun beside his bed: his garage was blown up 20 years ago and he has received death threats. Though he regards Paisley as a destructive force and a retrogressive influence, he thinks Major this week put himself in the wrong. Douglas is a former police reservist, an Ulster Unionist councillor and a Presbyterian who goes to church every week. He is also a deputy county Master of the Orange Order, and was flying to New Zealand this week as a delegate to the Orangemen's world council. His is the profile of the hard-line 'prod'. Yet Douglas comes over as a humorous and tolerant man who lives peaceably with his Catholic neighbours. 'My grandfather told me 'you can't trust Englishmen', he said. 'This suspicion goes back to the days of Home Rule.' Why, then, cling to London rule? 'Better the devil you know, I suppose.' Protestants were afraid that union with the Irish Republic would bring religious oppression, he said. They still regarded the Republic as a priest-ridden state and Irish Catholicism as a 'more superstitious, idolatrous faith'. Douglas himself went to a mixed-faith school. His observation was that the Catholic children spent more time learning religion and the Irish language while the Protestant kids got on with their maths and English. Ulster Protestants were thrifty, industrious and more likely to succeed. Religion is a cultural identifier in northern Ireland, not the cause of the conflict. Catholics and Protestants are not killing each other over the theological doctrine of transubstantiation. It is all about sovereign allegiances. As if to prove the point, opinion polls suggest a majority of Catholics - certainly the expanding middle-class - would vote to stay in the Union if a referendum were held tomorrow. It is this fundamental question of sovereignty which makes Ulster politics so polarised. The centre Alliance party is small and weak. In the face of what they call the 'pan-nationalist front', unionists remain badly divided. If the unionist leadership cannot break with the past, new voices and new blood will be needed to turn a ceasefire - still not reciprocated by the Loyalist terrorists - into a genuine peace. This week the Belfast Telegraph published a letter from 'a group of business and professional people from the Unionist tradition'. It called for 'a pluralist society at ease with itself' and went on: 'We must convince our fellow countrymen and women that there is a place for all of us in this new society. We 'protest-ants' must also be the 'persuade-ants'.' Where were these well-wishers when they were needed in the past? Roy Bradford, a minister in the last northern Ireland executive and now mayor of well-heeled Bangor, was scathing. 'It is the trahison des clercs,' he sniffed. 'The letter was unsigned. They hadn't the courage to put their names to it because they were afraid it would be bad for business. These businessmen are doing all right, and they don't want to get their hands dirty. 'For a professional to be publicly associated with the unionist position is not good for him. He does not want to seem a bigoted anti-Catholic. In the past, of course, a lot were afraid of being shot.' The mayor and his chief executive, Adrian McDowell, sat puffing cigars over a map of the town's yacht marina. This is one of the most prosperous parts of the province, a dormitory town for Belfast with below-average unemployment and above-average income. The plate-glass villas, with their hydrangeas and pampas grass, gravel sweeps and baying guard-dogs along the Gold Coast southern shore of Belfast Lough are enough to make the stockbrokers of Surrey weep with envy. Here, it is said, you will find the highest concentration of BMW owners in the UK. Even without the help of the Province's net subsidy from Westminster of Pounds 3bn a year, this would be a bourgeois paradise. Unionist politicians admit the middle class has opted out. In one sense it is not surprising: under direct rule from Westminster the powers of local authorities in Ulster are derisory. 'Burials and refuse collection - and that's about it,' said Sir Edward Archdale, a former borough councillor. After a distinguished career in the British Navy, Sir Edward, who describes himself as 'a loose cannon' in the unionist ship, retired to his homeland to study politics. He is a baronet who lives in a bungalow. In religion, he is a diehard traditionalist, in social affairs an anti-capitalist radical. His long absence allowed him to escape the atmosphere of intransigence among those whose lives have been shaped by the conflict. For Sir Edward the political answer for Ulster is self-government under the Crown, a similar status to that of the Isle of Man. 'We would rather be detached on our own than semi-detached with Dublin,' he said. Sir Edward would like to reconstitute his party as a secular Ulster National Party to appeal to unionists of all denominations. The plans of such potential peacemakers among the besieged majority were looking sadly premature this week. The IRA may have laid down its weapons but the unionists - mentally at least - are re-arming. A father of four sons asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals - all his boys are in the police. 'I once hoped they would be my coffin-bearers,' he said as he proudly showed a photograph. 'But all these years I have been afraid I would find myself carrying theirs.' That is what peace in Ulster means: a man whose last wish can be granted.
19940906000000000	FT  06 SEP 94 / Loyalist gunmen 'will not dance to IRA tune'. Loyalist paramilitary groups remain reluctant to back a ceasefire because of continuing fears that Sinn Fein and the IRA are dictating the pace and direction of government policy towards Northern Ireland. Sources close to the paramilitaries said Sunday night's bomb attack by the Ulster Volunteer Force on a Sinn Fein office in Belfast was a 'warning shot' aimed at underlining their resolve to defend Protestant interests. 'The situation is still being analysed but the message for now is unchanged from what it was after last week's IRA ceasefire. We are not going to dance to the IRA's tune,' said one source. The view was confirmed yesterday by a Presbyterian minister who has acted as intermediary for the paramilitaries. The Rev Roy Magee said: 'The loyalist paramilitaries are saying, 'We are still here and as far as we are concerned the war goes on'.' While the IRA's ceasefire appears to be holding, loyalist paramilitaries believe they have the capacity to exploit uncertainties and anxieties within unionist communities. Community workers meeting in the Shankill Road yesterday backed an end to all terrorist violence, while expressing fears about Sinn Fein's call for a campaign of civil protest by the Catholic community. To some Protestants the campaign - which has already led to the illegal reopening of cross-border roads by demonstrators - has resurrected memories of the campaign of Catholic civil disobedience in the early stages of the troubles. Mr Alfred McClory, who runs a community centre in the Shankill and liaises with loyalist prisoners, said yesterday: 'We are living from one day to the next. Peace is here today but it could just as well be gone tomorrow.' He said many working class Protestants wanted to see what reassurances, if any, the Rev Ian Paisley gets from his planned meeting in Downing Street with Mr John Major today. In the Shankill, as in other Protestant strongholds, the fear remains that the IRA and Sinn Fein, together with Dublin, are moving the peace process inexorably towards Irish unity. Mr Jim Rogers, an Ulster Unionist party councillor in Belfast, said: 'We want to see no change in Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the United Kingdom.' He added that while he did not condone violence, he could understand the logic behind the continuing existence of loyalist paramilitaries. 'Some of our people are saying they will need the actions of paramilitaries before the battle for real peace is won,' he said. Mr Rogers conceded that loyalist paramilitaries risked becoming isolated from their communities if they launched a full-scale military offensive. 'If they do that the loyalists will increasingly look like the baddies in the film and the IRA the goodies.' Such an assessment is understood to be shared by some members of the UVF and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the two main paramilitary organisations.
19940903000000000	FT  03 SEP 94 / Adams set to meet Irish PM: Politics. 'It is a total anathema to us that anyone would consider taking any sort of retaliation for the deeds of a few people within the unionist community' Martin McGuinness Sinn Fein executive member Sinn Fein may be poised to take another big step towards recognition as a fully legitimate democratic party with a meeting between Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, within two weeks, Dublin officials indicated last night. Word of the meeting - which would be the first ever between a Provisional Sinn Fein leader and an Irish premier - came as Mr Adams extended his list of demands by calling in Dublin for the withdrawal of British troops from nationalist areas. In Washington senior members of the US Congress warned that no extra money was likely to be available this year to help smooth the way to peace in Northern Ireland. But Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said after a meeting with President Bill Clinton in the holiday resort of Martha's Vineyard that he hoped 'substantial' sums would be forthcoming. As Downing Street continued to voice doubts about the permanency of the IRA ceasefire, republican leaders rejected the possibility of a violent reaction to the killing by loyalist paramilitaries of a Roman Catholic man on Thursday. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said it was 'a total anathema to us that anyone would consider taking any sort of retaliation for the deeds of a few people within the unionist community'. Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, responded to Thursday's loyalist attacks by pledging that the government would 'continue to pursue those who commit crimes of this sort'. Mr Reynolds met yesterday with Mr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, to discuss the setting up of the Irish government's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which is intended to include Sinn Fein for the first time in round-table talks with other political parties. Dublin hopes to establish the forum - which unionist parties are expected to boycott - before the end of October. Officials said Mr Reynolds would be anxious to 'get things moving' before departing on a visit to Australia in two weeks' time. They said a meeting with Mr Adams was 'inevitable' before he leaves. In the US, Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate appropriations committee which controls overseas aid, said money to smooth the peace process was already in the pipeline for next year, in the form of the US's Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. Mr Clinton said the US was 'prepared to take some steps to do whatever we can to help'. In London, Downing Street said Mr John Major would study the report he had demanded into the transfer on Thursday of four republican prisoners from the mainland to jails in Northern Ireland over the weekend.

19940902000000000	FT  02 SEP 94 / Catholic killed in Ulster on first day of IRA ceasefire: Major 'livid' over prisoner transfer to N Ireland. The first day of the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland ended last night with the killing of a Catholic man in north Belfast and a shooting in another Catholic area of the city. The incidents appeared to damage seriously any immediate prospect of loyalist paramilitaries ending their campaign of violence. The shootings came as a political row erupted over transfer of four Republican prisoners from the mainland to jails in Northern Ireland only hours after the start of the IRA ceasefire. A 'livid' Mr John Major ordered an urgent inquiry into the decision to move the prisoners, which threatened to put the high-risk UK-Irish peace initiative under renewed pressure by undermining efforts to reassure unionists that no secret deals had been entered into in return for Wednesday's IRA announcement. Meanwhile, the prospect of face-to-face meetings by the end of the year between Sinn Fein and the British government moved closer as London acknowledged that amplifications during the day by republican leaders showed they were 'moving in our direction' over the permanency of the IRA ceasefire. Police said the man who died last night was a 32-year-old unemployed labourer. They confirmed that the victim was a Roman Catholic. In a second incident, a car was fired at in in the Old Park area of north Belfast, and a person claiming to represent the loyalist terror group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, telephoned BBC Radio Belfast to say they had carried out that shooting. Downing Street said the decision to transfer the prisoners to Northern Ireland had been taken by officials without reference to ministers. But Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service said the decision to transfer a total of 14 prisoners - including the four moved today - was made in June by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. He said the timing of the transfers, once the decision had been made, was the responsibility of the prison service and had been determined by 'practical' considerations. Among the prisoners transferred was Mr Patrick Magee, who is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the Brighton bomb which devastated the Grand Hotel during the Conservative conference in 1984. The transfer was immediately attacked by Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister, who was badly injured in the blast. He said it was either 'an early reward for the IRA or crass political incompetence'. As the debate continued over whether the IRA had declared a permanent end to its armed campaign, Downing Street emphasised that the three-month countdown to talks with the IRA's political wing would not begin until the organisation's intentions were 'utterly clear'. But Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who does not share Downing Street's caution, said the controversy over the omission of the word 'permanent' from the IRA's ceasefire statement was over. He used a state-of-the-nation speech to urge all parties to show imagination and flexibility. Nobody, he said, should diminish the potential of the ceasefire 'by trying to interpret it as anything other than what it is'. His comments followed an article by Mr Gerry Adams in The Irish Times in which the Sinn Fein president said: 'Albert Reynolds, Dick Spring, John Hume and others have responded positively and correctly to the IRA announcement.' In a further republican amplification, Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said the organisation was committed to 'a complete cessation of military operations under all circumstances'. Meanwhile, in London, Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, said he thought the countdown to talks between London and Sinn Fein should begin at once. 'I would think it is not unreasonable for the 90 days to start now,' he said. In Washington, there was little tangible evidence that the US was putting flesh on its promise of support to the peace process. In the past, US president Bill Clinton has expressed interest in a visit to Ireland, and there was some preliminary discussion earlier this year of adding Ireland to his itinerary for one of his two trips to Europe. No plans yet exist. Page 9 Business hopes for up to 30,000 jobs Media ban may be lifted Siege mentality takes a grip on Protestants Peace still not guaranteed Observer Page 15
19940831000000000	FT  31 AUG 94 / Reynolds declares Ulster is poised for peace. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, declared last night that Northern Ireland was 'poised for peace' as the province prepared for an IRA ceasefire that might signal the end of its 25-year campaign against the presence of British troops. With expectations mounting of an imminent - and possibly historic - IRA announcement, Mr Reynolds said people would be able to make 'an entirely new beginning on this island' in 'a very short time'. 'A complete cessation of violence' - as demanded by the British and Irish governments - 'and the principles of the Downing Street declaration are our new starting point', Mr Reynolds said after a meeting of the Irish cabinet. He later had his second telephone conversation in just over 24 hours with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. Downing Street said it was 'a matter of keeping in touch'. Mr Reynolds's comments came as the British government moved to counter Unionist suspicions that it had offered secret concessions to republican leaders to secure a ceasefire. Downing Street said no concessions had been made to anyone. In the US White House officials were said to be 'at fever pitch' over the improving prospects of peace. The Clinton administration is understood to be preparing to offer a large increase in financial aid to Ulster. The US already gives Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) a year to the International Fund for Ireland, which is jointly administered by the UK and the Irish Republic. A permanent cessation of IRA violence would open the way for exploratory talks between Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and the British government within three months. The talks would explore the basis for Sinn Fein's admittance into talks on the province's future and examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, last night called for talks with Sinn Fein to begin 'a lot sooner than three months'. Yesterday's developments followed the first public acknowledgement by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that he had advised IRA leaders to consider halting their armed campaign. Later on Irish television he urged unionists to set aside their suspicions in the interests of peace. He said: 'If we are prepared to say let's put the last 25 years behind us . . . surely the unionists have within their ranks men and women of courage prepared to take the same risks as some of us have taken.' Senior Ulster Unionists appeared last night to have accepted London's assurances , with Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, expressing confidence the government had no plans to change Ulster's constitutional position. But the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, warned angrily that a ceasefire achieved through the surrender of the British government could be 'a recipe for civil war'. Both men to meet Mr Major within the next few days. Early indications suggested loyalist paramilitaries were determined to continue their armed campaign. A huge 550 lb booby-trap bomb was defused by security forces in Co Tyrone last night. Another bomb exploded at the Fort Whiterock Army base in the republican Turf Lodge area of Belfast. No injuries were reported. Ceasefire will bring political challenges, Page 8
19941112000000000	FT  12 NOV 94 / Reynolds skulks in the wings: The Newry murder has made the Irish premier reticent. The usually firm hand of Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish republic, was notably absent yesterday as his government awaited assurances from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, after Thursday's murder of a post office worker across the border in Newry. Few commentators in Dublin can remember a time in the 10 weeks since the IRA ceasefire in which the Irish premier has been quite so reticent about taking centre stage on a policy which he has orchestrated almost single-handedly from the Irish side. After his government's decision to rescind its programme of IRA prisoner releases, it was left to the hapless justice minister, Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, normally a sure-footed performer, to explain the about-turn. The Dublin government has often warned of the dangers of leaving large numbers of republicans behind bars once a ceasefire was in place. It argued a goodwill gesture was needed to bolster the moderate voice in the IRA. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn was adamant that at no time did the government plan the release of more than nine prisoners, in spite of newspaper reports in the republic that as many as 30 convicted terrorists were being considered. Her government colleagues were yesterday quick to applaud her robust defence of the policy reversal. Only Sinn Fein expressed outright disappointment. Another surprise was the absence of any murmur of discontent from civil liberties groups. Some politicians, however, privately wondered about the consistency - having offered to release the prisoners - of withdrawing the concession because of an event 60 miles away in another state. Not only the release programme has been put on hold. Dublin is reviewing its whole approach to the peace process. Where days ago a cross-party consensus had prevailed in the republic in support of Mr Reynolds' efforts, the opposition yesterday seemed to have a renewed bounce in its step. Both governments insist the peace process is on track. Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, are due to meet in Dublin on Monday about progress on the framework document. The Northern Ireland Office said yesterday that nothing had changed its 'working assumption' that the IRA had ceased its military operations. Exploratory talks with Sinn Fein about the 'practical consequences' of the ceasefire may start this year. They would cover the decommissioning of arms and explosives, and the steps required to return Sinn Fein to democratic politics and the bilateral talks. But the Newry murder and Sinn Fein's less than frank explanation underline the danger of taking its assurances on the permanence of the ceasefire at face value without first verifying the disposal of arms and explosives. 'It will certainly make us more cautious,' said a UK government official. The Newry tragedy has underscored British concerns that the issue of arms and explosives must be addressed before full political negotiations can begin, in spite of the insistence of Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein vice-president, that the issue is 'down the road'. The main outstanding question is whether the Newry attack was carried out by a renegade republican unit or whether it was in some way at the behest of the IRA's central command. If the former, then there seems no reason why London should not begin discussing the handing in of arms with republican leaders before the end of the year, as previously envisaged. Indeed, the incident might even play a part in helping to convince the leadership of Sinn Fein that it has something to gain from the surrender of at least some IRA weaponry at a relatively early stage in the peace process. But if the raid was sanctioned by IRA leaders, then the UK government's so-called working assumption that the IRA ceasefire was permanent would be under severe pressure. It is hard to see under those circumstances how a severe delay in preliminary dialogue between London and republican leaders could be avoided. Thursday's attack also underlines the importance of efforts being made by senior British and Irish officials to develop a co-ordinated approach to dismantling paramilitary arsenals, as agreed at Chequers last month. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said the discussions would concentrate on the 'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons held by paramilitaries to be handed over. It is almost certain that these discussions will have continued at yesterday's meeting of the liaison committee of British and Irish officials in Dublin. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will be under pressure to say more on Monday about the substance of the committee's deliberations.
