19920626000000000	FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology: New era looks to mind drugs - In the second article of a series on drug research, Clive Cookson outlines treatments for mental conditions from anxiety to memory loss. The pharmaceutical industry has an abysmal record in treating disorders of the brain and nervous system. While new drugs have transformed the outlook for people suffering from infectious illnesses, heart disease, and gastro-intestinal problems, most psychiatric patients depend on medicines discovered several decades ago. Current treatments for mental conditions, from mild anxiety to severe psychosis, emerged during the 'black box' era of drug discovery. Doctors observed that they relieved symptoms - often poorly and unpredictably - but pharmacologists had no idea how they worked. For the most serious problems - degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's - there is still nothing that really works. The outlook, however, is much brighter, as scientific discoveries about the chemistry and biology of the brain find their way into new drugs. The ones being introduced during the 1990s are based on an understanding of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers which send signals between cells) and receptors (protein molecules on the cell which receive the signals and initiate specific biological responses). After the year 2000, there is the prospect of far superior treatments based on the genetic processes involved in mental disorders. The best known neurotransmitter is 5-HT, also called 5-hyroxytryptamine or serotonin, which is active not only in the brain but also in other parts of the body. It is associated with several types of receptor, each giving a different biological response. The pharmaceutical industry is developing drugs to interact with each specific type, as an agonist to stimulate the receptor or as an antagonist to block it. Glaxo of the UK has been investigating 5-HT systems for almost 20 years and expects a spectacular payback from two drugs: sumatriptan and ondansetron. Sumatriptan (trade name Imigran) is the first effective treatment for migraine, the intense recurrent headache suffered by at least one adult in 12. It was launched last year as an injection and is being introduced in the UK this month in more convenient form as pills. With sumatriptan ahead of competition, its potential sales are huge - more than Pounds 1bn a year - if it can overcome doctors' fear of side effects. Sumatriptan is an agonist for the 5-HT1 category of receptor, stimulating the uptake of 5-HT in the cranial blood vessels. That reverses the swelling which triggers a migraine attack. Glaxo had hoped sumatriptan would have no effect elsewhere in the body but experience shows that some patients feel tightness in the chest after injections. That is presumably because blood vessels elsewhere in the body contain a few of the same 5-HT1 receptors. Glaxo says sumatriptan's side effects are insignificant for healthy people but they show how difficult it is to make a selective receptor-based drug. Ondansetron (Zofran) is an antagonist for a different receptor type, the 5-HT3. It was launched two years ago as an anti-emetic to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by cancer therapy, but Glaxo is now carrying out clinical trials with ondansetron for a range of psychiatric conditions including anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and age-associated memory impairment. Glaxo researchers are understandably cautious about proclaiming ondansetron to be a psychiatric wonder-drug. They blanch when outsiders talk of it as a potential 'smart drug' which could improve everyone's memory. Mike Tyers, pharmacology director for Glaxo Group Research, says the 5-HT3 receptors on neurones (nerve cells in the brain) 'seem to be there to control things when they go wrong.' When everything is working properly, 'they are fairly silent.' If so, a 5-HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron may help to restore the balance in several disorders, without side-effects. Another group of new drugs based on the 5-HT system is leading to improved treatments for depression. The specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as they are known, increase the low 5-HT levels in the brain which are associated with many forms of depression. Eli Lilley of the US is already selling more than Dollars 1bn a year of its pioneering SSRI, fluoxetine (Prozac) launched in 1988. In hot pursuit is a second generation of SSRIs led by paroxetine (Seroxat), which was developed jointly by Novo Nordisk of Denmark and SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group. SSRIs have fewer side effects than the 'tricyclic' drugs which have dominated antidepressant treatment for 30 years. Yet SSRIs still leave much to be desired: they take at least two weeks to relieve depression and they fail to work in about one third of patients. That may reflect partly the poor quality of clinical diagnosis in depression and other non-acute mental disorders. Some scientists believe that all forms of depression ultimately work through a common biochemical pathway. If they are right - and not everyone agrees with the theory - it may eventually be possible to find a fast-acting drug that will help anyone who is clinically depressed. The greatest neurological challenge for pharmaceutical research is to find a cure for the degenerative brain diseases which lead inexorably to dementia and death. The most prevalent is Alzheimer's, which affects as many as 20 per cent of people over 70. The search for an Alzheimer's treatment has led to a new class of drugs, the nootropics, developed to enhance memory and other cognitive functions. The first generation of nootropics aims to increase the amount of acetylcholine in the brain. Alzheimer's patients have a marked deficit of this neurotransmitter. Most of the Alzheimer's drugs developed recently work indirectly by inhibiting an enzyme called cholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine. They include piracetam from UCB of Belgium; oxiracetam from SmithKline Beecham; tacrine from Warner-Lambert of the US; and physostigmine from Forest Laboratories of the US. Although they have shown promise in clinical trials, the manufacturers have not yet produced evidence strong enough to convince the US Food and Administration to licence any of the drugs. Du Pont Merck, the pharmaceutical joint venture between Du Pont and Merck of the US, has a promising anti-dementia drug now in late clinical trials which works in a different way. It acts directly to stimulate the release of acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters in the brain. The drug (chemical name linopirdine) is noteworthy too for its unusually vivid and appealing trade name - Aviva. However none of these memory enhancing drugs, even Aviva, can do more than temporarily reverse or slow down the mental degeneration that is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. None prevents the build-up of tangled plaques of amyloid protein, which progressively destroy patients' brains. The best long-term hope for curing progressive dementias is to identify the genetic mechanism responsible and then develop drugs to block its effect. In the case of Alzheimer's, a fault in a gene coding for amyloid precursor protein (APP) seems to be responsible. In a few families, this is inherited but it is more often caused by environmental factors. Many pharmaceutical researchers are now working on long-range projects to block APP, though they are hampered by the fact that there is not yet a good animal model for Alzheimer's. Athena Neurosciences of California is one of the biotechnology companies furthest advanced in this area. More futuristic still are ideas for repairing brain damage by growing new nerve cells. That does not normally occur in an adult brain but scientists are accumulating evidence that selective regeneration could be achieved by removing some of the genetic factors that inhibit the process. The series will continue next month by looking at asthma drugs.
19921218000000000	FT  18 DEC 92 / Technology: Drugs that lighten depression - Paul Abrahams on why the market for anti-depressants is growing so fast. Christmas is not the season of goodwill for all men and women. A recent study in Birmingham suggests that on Christmas day attempted suicides increase by 25 per cent. Depression is a fatal illness - nearly three quarters of suicides are linked to it. Clinical depression, the persistent and sustained feeling that the self is worthless, the world meaningless and the future hopeless, is the most common emotional disorder. There is, however, no agreement about the disease's incidence because only about 25 per cent of those depressed visit a doctor. Roger Bickerstaffe, research director at the Belgian group Solvay Pharmaceuticals, reckons a third of the population will need treatment at some time in their lives and that at any one time 5 per cent will be receiving treatment. The costs of depression are immense. The American Psychiatric Association estimates depressive illness costs the US Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17bn) a year, including Dollars 12.7bn through hospitalisation, out-patient treatment and drugs. The Office of Health Economics, a UK think-tank, says the direct costs to the National Health Service are about Pounds 333m a year. The anti-depressant drug market is changing and growing rapidly. Although 9m prescriptions are issued in the UK every year, most are for old and cheap generic products. But these older drugs, called tricyclics, are giving way to a new, more expensive generation of medicines called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Smith New Court, the UK broker, estimates the worldwide market has grown 20 per cent a year over the last three years from Pounds 700m a year to Pounds 1.2bn. Geoffrey Dunbar, director of SmithKline Beecham's central nervous system therapeutic unit, reckons the market could quadruple by the year 2000. Growth is partly being driven by the increased incidence of the illness, according to a study published in this month's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. General practitioners may also be more adept at diagnosing and treating the illness which is under-recognised, under-treated and stigmatised, according to the OHE. There are two main categories of depression. Exogenous or reactive depression is related to outside events such as a close death or losing a job. However, clinicians remain unsure of the causes of endogenous depression not linked to outside events. 'The plain fact is that nobody really knows the causes of depression,' admits Bickerstaffe. However, he says the biological infrastructure of the central nervous system appears to affect mood. The hypothesis is that a shortage of naturally occuring neurotransmitting chemicals - known as monoamines - may lead to depression, says Dunbar. Between each nerve in the central nervous system is a gap, known as a synapse, he explains. So that a nerve impulse can pass across the synapse between a presynaptic nerve to a postsynaptic nerve, neurotransmitting chemicals are released by the presynaptic nerve into the synapse. The chemicals in the synapse then trigger a signal in the receiving postsynaptic nerve. A lack of these chemicals such as serotonin, noradrenalin and dopamine, appears to suppress neurotransmitter stimulation and be linked to depression, says Gary Tollefson, executive director of psycho- pharmacology at Lilly Research Laboratories. Tricyclics, the most common anti-depressants, are believed to work by correcting the shortage of monoamines in the synapse. Normally, once the monoamines have done their job, a proportion is reabsorbed into the presynaptic nerve. The rest is broken down by enzymes. Tricyclics work by hindering the reabsorption. This increases the concentration of monoamines in the synapse and therefore stimulates the post-synaptic nerve for longer. The drugs are effective for about 70 per cent of patients. The problem with tricyclics is two-fold, explains Tollefson. First they affect the postsynaptic nerve as well as the presynaptic nerve. They influence other neurotransmission systems, including those for dopamine, histamine and noradrenaline. The result is a series of significant side-effects, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, drowsiness and constipation. Many patients fail to complete the course. But more important is the toxicity of tricyclics. By taking five to six times the normal dose, patients can kill themselves. A second class of anti-depressants was developed in the 1960s called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The MAOIs work by binding with the enzymes in the synapse that break down the monoamines. This raises the level of monoamines and increases activity in the central nervous system. However, these drugs also have unwanted side-effects. MAOIs are irreversible, which means the enzyme has to be replaced, which can take four weeks. One problem is that the enzyme which is bound to the MAOI has other jobs including the breaking down of tyramines, chemicals found in some cheeses and wine. Without the enzyme, levels of tyramine can build up. This can lead to increased blood pressure, heart failure, even death. Recent market growth has been driven by the new generation of drugs, SSRIs, of which four are currently marketed. They are Fluvoxamine developed by Solvay; Prozac sold by Eli Lilly, the American group; Lustral, also known as Zoloft in north America, which is marketed by Pfizer of the US; and Seroxat, discovered by Novo Nordisk in Denmark and marketed in most of the world by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American company. SSRIs also work by inhibiting the amount of serotonin taken back into the nerve terminals and so increasing its availability in the synapse. They are no faster and no more effective than the tricyclics and considerably more expensive. According to the OHE the cheapest tricyclic costs about 82p for 30 days treatment, compared with Pounds 33.90 for the most expensive SSRI. They are, however, far more selective than the tricyclics and do not affect other neurotransmission systems. Dunbar at SmithKline Beecham says clinical trials suggest the drop out rate for SSRIs is 10 per cent less than tricyclics. In addition, they are far less toxic than tricyclics, meaning it is almost impossible to overdose on them. The leading SSRI is Prozac. Its sales were hit badly in 1990 after the Church of Scientology claimed it induced violence and suicidal tendencies. The allegations were dismissed by the US Food and Drug Administration but the drug's market share fell from 25 per cent in July 1990 to 21 per cent in April the following year. Nevertheless, Prozac's sales reached Dollars 910m last year and may reach Dollars 1bn this year. Prozac's rivals are building up sales fast. Zoloft was launched in February but already has sales of about Dollars 185m. Seroxat is not yet marketed in the US where it will be known as Paxil, but had 20 per cent of the UK market by value during the first six months of this year. Meanwhile, drugs groups are investing heavily in the area. Bickerstaffe at Solvay reckons 11 anti-depressants are ready to be or have been submitted to licensing authorities. A further 30 are in development. Two SSRIs, from American Home Products and Bristol Myers Squibb, will shortly be launched in the US. A number of companies, including Roche and Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, are working on a new class of MAOIs, called reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase type A (RIMA). Unlike earlier generations of MAOIs, they do not bind irreversibly to the enzymes necessary to break down tyramine and can be used without dietary restrictions. Researchers are also looking to synthesise drugs that affect only targeted receptor cells. In addition, they are searching for compounds that replicate or block the neuro-peptides capable of modulating the neurotransmitters. The attractions of the anti-depression market are not limited to its size and rapid growth, says Tollefson. Research on the central nervous system for depression will have spin-offs in other illnesses, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. This series on new drugs looks next month at combating skin problems.
19921006000000000	FT  06 OCT 92 / FDA told SmithKline Beecham's depression drug is safe. AN ADVISORY committee of the US Food and Drug Administration yesterday voted unanimously that SmithKline Beecham's anti-depressant, Seroxat, was safe and effective. The decision paves the way for the drug to be launched next year in the US, the world's largest market. The drug, to be known in the US as Paxil, is seen as SmithKline Beecham's most important new compound, capable of generating worldwide sales of Pounds 350m within three to four years. Approval of Seroxat has been delayed by concern about the safety of Prozac, marketed by Eli Lilly of the US. That drug is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) in the same drug class as Seroxat. The US anti-depressant market - the largest in the world - has grown from Pounds 700m in 1989 to about Pounds 1.2bn last year, thanks to greater use of SSRIs. An estimated 14m Americans - 7 per cent of the US adult population  -are depressed. Prozac has captured 50 per cent of the American anti-depressant sector by value since it came to market in 1989, making it one of the most successful drug launches ever. Last year Prozac generated revenues of Dollars 910m (Pounds 511m). Other SSRIs include Solvay's Fluvoxamine, co-marketed by Upjohn, and Pfizer's Lustral, known in the US as Zoloft. However, Prozac's sales have been affected by attacks from the Church of Scientology which claimed Prozac created suicidal thoughts. Last year, an FDA committee advised there was no causative link between the drug and suicidal behaviour. SmithKline Beecham believes Seroxat has fewer side-effects than other treatments. Studies suggest patients on placebo have more suicidal thoughts than those on Seroxat. Seroxat is non-toxic and cannot be successfully used by suicidal people to kill themselves. By contrast, there are annually in the UK about 500 suicide fatalities associated with tricyclic anti-depressants, the older and most common class of drugs used before SSRIs. Tricyclics still represent 50 per cent of anti-depressant prescriptions. The psychopharmacological drugs advisory committee's recommendation need not be followed by the FDA, but that would be unusual. Market report, Page 46
19930313000000000	FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: SmithKline Beecham suffers double blow. SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs group, received a double blow yesterday. First, a US food and drug administration committee refused to recommend Kytril, one of its most promising drugs. And secondly, a study was published suggesting that Seroxat, its anti-depressant which analysts believe could reach sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m), was no more effective than earlier and far less expensive medicines. SB's shares fell 21 1/2 p to 469 1/2 p. The study, published in yesterday's British Medical Journal, analysed 58 trials to compare old anti-depressants called tricyclics with a new generation of anti-depressants called selected serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These include SB's Seroxat, Eli Lilly's Prozac, and Pfizer's Zoloft. The analysis suggested that SSRIs were no more efficacious than older and cheaper tricyclics. SSRI manufacturers have never claimed this, but have argued their drugs were more effective because they generate fewer side effects. This allows more patients to continue taking their medicines. However, the study claimed that 32.3 per cent of patients on SSRIs dropped out of the clinical trials compared with 33.2 per cent on tricyclics. SSRI manufacturers had previously claimed there was a 10 per cent difference in drop-out rates, said Mr Nick Freemantle, research fellow at the Nuffield Institute for Health at Leeds University and co-author of the study. If that had been true, then the extra cost of SSRIs would have been money well spent. A tricyclic can cost only Pounds 1.43 for 30 days treatment, compared with up to Pounds 33.90 for an SSRI. The only sales point left to the SSRIs was that they were less toxic than tricyclics, said Mr Freemantle. About 400 suicides a year are related to anti-depressants, he added. The study concluded that first line treatment of depression using SSRIs may greatly increase cost with only questionable benefits and that the drugs should not be routinely used as a first-line treatment for major depression. In the US, the FDA's gastrointestinal advisory committee were unable to recommend approval of Kytril, because of potential carcinogenic and cardiovascular side-effects. Mr Bob Bauman, SB chief executive, said the committee had not felt competent to comment on these issues. The drug is used to prevent nausea in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 'We are confident we can resolve these issues with the FDA,' he said. 'We have already satisfied 20 countries about the safety of this drug. There is no evidence in humans of carcinogenic side-effects.' Kytril had worldwide sales last year of Dollars 55m. Glaxo's equivalent drug Zofran has been licenced in 63 countries and generated worldwide sales of Pounds 163m during the last six of 1992.
19930501000000000	FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Genentech shares jump 16%. SHARES in Genentech, the Swiss-controlled and California-based biotechnology company, jumped by 16 per cent yesterday to Dollars 37 7/8 after an independent medical study concluded that the company's Activase heart attack drug was more effective than others. Genentech had financed most of the Dollars 55m study, known as Gusto. It was one of the largest clinical trials of heart attack patients ever undertaken and involved 41,000 patients in the US and 15 other countries. The company's sales of Activase had dropped considerably in 1992 following an Oxford University study called Isis-3 that questioned the effectiveness of Activase. A RIVAL antidepressant to Prozac, the leading antidepressant drug, may soon be available in the US following yesterday's decision by an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration to recommend Effexor, writes Karen Zagor. The new drug, made by a unit of American Home Products, was described as effective for patients who have never been treated for depression and for those who do not respond well to their current medication. The most common side effects are nausea, drowsiness and dizziness. Although decisions by the advisory panel are not binding, the FDA generally rules in favour of drugs which are recommended for marketing. Prozac has been under steady pressure in recent years. The Church of Scientology has waged a campaign against the drug claiming it makes people suicidal. More recently, Pfizer's Zoloft has proved tough competition, and SmithKline Beecham's recently-launched Paxil has now entered the fray.
19930907000000000	FT  07 SEP 93 / Technology: A renaissance in treatment - New drugs to treat schizophrenia are finally becoming available. A few years ago, tales of a miraculous new drug on the market to treat schizophrenia began to make their way around hospitals and psychiatrists' offices in Europe and the US. The stories told of patients debilitated by mental illness, sinking desperately into hallucinations and paranoia, then suddenly rehabilitated and living a normal life. The success of the drug, clozapine, which was launched by Sandoz of Switzerland in the US in 1989, awakened a long-dormant interest in developing treatments for schizophrenia. Encouraged by the clozapine experience, pharmaceutical groups are now producing a new generation of drugs to alleviate schizophrenia. Among the most promising are risperidone and bromoperidol, both manufactured by Janssen, a Belgian subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and remoxipride, made by Astra in Sweden. The UK pharmaceutical group Zeneca is expected to launch a competing treatment by late 1995 and Merck of the US and Kabi of Sweden are also developing candidates. Schizophrenia, a serious mental illness involving hallucinations and paranoia, and in rare cases 'split personality' syndrome, is a relatively common disease, affecting about 1 per cent of the population. It usually appears in late adolescence, when the frontal lobes of the brain are developing rapidly, and its impact is devastating. If untreated, the afflicted lose touch with reality and often drift into extreme poverty. Nearly one-third of the homeless population in the US is thought to suffer from the disease. The drug market for schizophrenia is already substantial, with total annual sales amounting to about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn), according to Ian Smith, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Lehman Brothers International in London. It is also one of the faster-growing areas in the industry, with sales expanding at a rate of about 9 per cent a year. Moreover, with the large number of new drugs for schizophrenia coming on to the market, these numbers could balloon. 'We are finally starting to see a wide range of drugs developed for schizophrenia,' says Peter Tooley, head of medical affairs for Janssen in the UK. 'After 30 to 40 years of studying the disease, we're starting to get a handle on the disease.' Schizophrenia, which has long been a mystery to scientists, is now known to involve errant chemical messages making their way through the brain. 'Dopamine receptors' are thought to play an important role in this mental game of telephone, and almost all schizophrenic drugs on the market - referred to as neuroleptics - inhibit different classifications of these receptors. Prior to the current generation of neuroleptics, the development of schizophrenic treatments depended more on luck than science. The first drug used in treating schizophrenia, thorozine, was discovered by accident. A doctor in Vietnam noticed that the compound, used at that point as a sedative, was effective in ridding patients of hallucinations. Psychiatrists began to use the product to treat schizophrenia and similar drugs were soon widely available. Support for neuroleptics as the primary treatment for schizophrenia has been growing ever since, and is now embraced by the majority of psychiatrists. Despite the growing faith in drugs to alleviate mental disease, the market for schizophrenia drugs is just emerging from a dry spell which spanned nearly 30 years. 'After the first drug came out, all we saw were variations on that treatment,' says John Kane, chairman of psychiatry at the Long Island Jewish Medical Centre, New York. 'That's why it's so exciting now to see a renaissance in drugs for the disease.' Doctors are particularly anxious for alternatives because past treatments have been far from perfect. Drugs introduced prior to clozapine were extremely effective in controlling the hallucinations and paranoia, but they left patients depressed, apathetic and socially inept. They had no effect at all on large numbers of schizophrenic patients and provoked disturbing side-effects: a clumsy gait, compulsive foot tapping and an irreversible neurological syndrome, 'tardive dyskinesia', characterised by twitching of the facial muscles and tongue. When it hit the market, clozapine was unique in that it did not cause muscle spasms. It was also effective for many patients who had failed to respond to traditional treatments. 'For many of my patients, clozapine has seemed like a miracle,' says Robert McDivitt, trustee of the American Psychiatric Association. Clozapine has its own problems, though. Its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia had been documented 20 years before its 1989 launch, but was withdrawn from the market due to a risky, though rare side-effect: agranulocytosis, a white blood cell deficiency. Agranulocytosis can often prove fatal. However, the drug was finally approved for market because so few patients taking the drug - around 1 per cent - develop the affliction, and because the risk of the disease can be greatly reduced through regular blood tests. The drug's approval also reflected the desperate circumstances of many schizophrenic patients. Clozapine has not been completely effective in improving patients' social skills. 'Clozapine is a dirty drug, by which I mean that it affects a number of different dopamine receptors,' says Peter Jager, international product manager for the drug. 'The new generation of drugs will be addressing specific receptors, and will therefore be much cleaner.' Neuroleptics such as risperidone have generated a great deal of interest because they seem to deal with the sociability of the patient as well as the more serious problem of hallucinations. The drug can cause muscle spasms, although the problem is much less severe than with traditional treatments. The medical community is waiting anxiously to acquire the new drugs, several of which have been approved in Europe but not in the US. 'I have one patient who is just hanging on until she can get risperidone,' says Jerome Rogoff, a professor at Harvard Medical School and assistant chief of psychiatry at the Faulkner Hospital in Boston. 'It may make a difference.' Despite progress in research on schizophrenia, a great deal of mystery still shrouds the disease. 'No one knows, for instance, why the drugs have an impact on the receptor cells within hours, but no effect on the patient for weeks,' says Donald Klein, a professor of psychology at Columbia University. 'It may be that the receptors are just the first domino in the chain, and once the other dominoes are understood, that would pave the way for new drugs.' It is also unclear why neuroleptics now on the market are effective in treating some patients and not others. Some scientists believe it is a question of narrowing the search down to a single, specific receptor. Others believe schizophrenia is not a single disease, but a group of diseases, which require distinct drug treatments. Even if researchers come up with a perfect drug, doctors say it will not eradicate the disease. Patients usually suffer a relapse if they stop taking medication. 'Patients with no mental illness will stop taking their pills once they feel well,' said Rogoff. 'With schizophrenic patients this is an even greater risk. I have some patients who refuse even to try certain drugs because they say a voice has told them it's poisonous.' Still, the wider choice of drugs on the market will be a boon, not only to schizophrenic sufferers, but to researchers as well. 'With the new treatments, we will be able to monitor the side-effects, and improvements in patients' condition, and get a better understanding of the role of the dopamine receptors,' says Jager. 'The key has not yet been found, but we are coming closer every year.'
19931104000000000	FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Astra continues sales of Roxiam in Europe. ASTRA, the Swedish drugs group, said it has not withdrawn its schizophrenia treatment from sale in Europe, despite a decision by its partner Merck to warn against its use in the US. More than 100 people in the US who took part in clinical trials on the drug, known as Roxiam, had been continuing to take it pending a decision on its authorisation by the US's Food and Drug Admistration, Merck said. Prompted by blood disorders in eight patients taking the drug in Europe, including one death, Merck earlier this week said it had advised doctors in the US to stop medication. Astra, which developed the product and has marketed it in Europe for two-and-a-half years, said it had recommended 'far-reaching precautions' in the use of the drug. Full information on the product, which had sales in the first three months of the year of SKr50m (Dollars 6m), had been sent to regulatory authorities and physicians, it added.
19931009000000000	FT  09 OCT 93 / High on hype: Ethical questions raised by the personality-changing drug Prozac. When a drug becomes the butt of a joke in a Woody Allen film, its manufacturers can be reasonably assured that it has become part of a national culture. Prozac's mention in Allen's latest comedy, Manhattan Murder Mystery, confirms its status as the most successful psychiatric medicine in the US, overtaking Valium both in terms of the value of sales and as the drug the film world turns to as a symbol of the times. The spread of the small off-white and green capsules has been debated on prime-time US television shows. Now a book about the impact of the drug on patients' personalities, Listening to Prozac by Dr Peter Kramer, a psychiatrist at Brown University, Rhode Island, has made it on to the New York Times's list of the top 15 non-fiction titles. The drug's growth has been rapid. Only two years after its launch in 1987 by Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals group, doctors were writing 650,000 new prescriptions a month for Prozac - a rate of growth from launch that drug companies rarely achieve. To date, nearly 4.5m Americans have taken the drug at some time. Elsewhere in the world, another 4m have used it. Global sales totalled Dollars 1.1bn last year, making it Eli Lilly's biggest selling product. Prozac was launched in the UK in January 1989, available on prescription, and sales are believed to be growing rapidly although no figures have been released. Prozac's success is based not just on its efficacy as an anti-depressant; it is regarded by the medical profession as no more effective than previous generations of such drugs. Nor is it due entirely to its safety record, which is significantly better than its predecessors: allegations by the US Church of Scientology that Prozac was encouraging suicidal tendencies among users were rejected last year by the US Food and Drug Administration. Prozac's popularity with patients, and the resulting pressure on doctors to prescribe it, is based above all on its apparent power to alter personalities as well as cure depression. Dr Kramer says in his book that the drug can, in a substantial minority of patients, change personalities within a few weeks. It can boost social confidence in the habitually timid, make the sensitive brash, and transform the introverted into outgoing, loquacious people - rapidly achieving what psychiatrists hope, and often fail, to accomplish by other methods over a period of years. It can even, says Dr Kramer, improve business acumen. The drug creates hyperthymia, a condition which makes people optimistic, decisive, quick of thought, charismatic, energetic and confident. Dr Kramer dubs the phenomenon 'cosmetic psychopharmacology'. If you can have plastic surgery, or dye your hair blond, why not take this 'anti-wallflower compound' to improve your temperament, he writes. 'Since you only live once, why not live it as a blond? Why not a peppy blond?' asks Dr Kramer. It sounds too good to be true. Prozac seems to have few immediate side-effects and, as far as doctors know, is non-addictive. Unlike LSD or alcohol, it boosts confidence and productivity without distorting perception. But critics believe the hype is overdone. Dr Joe Collier, consultant clinical pharmacologist at St George's Hospital Medical School, London, said clinical evidence showed that Prozac was no more effective than older, cheaper anti-depressants. 'We've seen drugs hailed as 'transformers' before. For example, when L-Dopa came out to treat Parkinson's Disease, people claimed that it had all sorts of extra qualities - it was even seen as an aphrodisiac,' he says. 'The idea that a drug can make you 'more normal than normal' worries me a lot. Anything that makes you feel super-normal for a while may have serious consequences in the end.' Eli Lilly has deliberately not tried to exploit some of Dr Kramer's more dramatic claims, pointing out they are not backed by scientific trials. The company does not pretend that Prozac has miraculous qualities. Prozac is only one of four drugs in the class known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - chemicals that affect the process by which signals are transmitted in the brain. The others in the category are: Fluvoxamine, developed by Solvay of Belgium; Lustral, known as Zoloft in North America where it is marketed by Pfizer; and Seroxat, discovered by Novo Nordisk in Denmark and marketed in most parts of the world by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group. On medical criteria, other SSRIs may be more appropriate for particular patients. At the same time, no SSRI comes close to being a panacea. On average they are effective for only about 70 per cent of patients. Prozac is no exception. Nevertheless, Prozac can prove a potent anti-depressant, as many in the US have found. One mother of a depressed teenager who takes the drug says: 'The amazing thing is that a kid who could not even hold a casual conversation, would stay in her room and would become anxious just worrying about what to have for dinner, now has a normal life. In a matter of months, she has become socially confident, able to attend school and spend time with friends. The change is phenomenal.' The effects Prozac has on personalities raise ethical dilemmas. By affecting the way the brain operates, Prozac and the other SSRIs go beyond curing what doctors perceive as illnesses, to alter the kind of person a patient is. Just as a surgeon can transform someone's appearance, Prozac changes temperaments. Personalities become a collection of neurotransmitting chemicals, subject to alteration. Another dilemma is the question of whether doctors should prescribe Prozac to healthy people who want to enhance their personalities, when teenagers taking drugs such as ecstasy - which induces a near-instant feeling of well-being - are frowned upon by governments. The point at which a line should be drawn between acceptable and non-acceptable use of drugs is hard to define; at some point, governments might be tempted to prescribe the drug for criminals or those with anti-social tendencies. There is also the danger of over-prescription. Prozac's long-term effects are unknown. Valium, for instance, was hailed as a cure for female depression in the 1960s but was subsequently found to be addictive. Five times as many women take Prozac as men. Pharmaceutical research and development take many years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Prozac and the other SSRIs are the product of discoveries made 20 years ago. As the understanding of the brain's molecular biology improves, so even more potent and selective mind-altering drugs will become available. Solvay reckons there are more than 40 such anti-depressants ready to be submitted to licensing authorities or in development. The dilemmas posed by 'cosmetic psychopharmacology' will not disappear.

19931130000000000	FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (5): How Ted Turner hit the headlines - Martin Dickson enjoys the fast-paced story of a modern media mogul. IT AIN'T AS EASY AS IT LOOKS By Porter Bibb Crown, Dollars 25, 468 pages In the appropriate setting of Las Vegas, gambling capital of the world, Atlanta television station owner Ted Turner announced to a sceptical world in May 1979 that he was about to steal a march on the entire communications industry and launch the first 24-hour-a-day television news network. It would be called Cable News Network, or CNN. The event was classic Turner: a combination of inspired business acumen,a touch of bombast, immense risk-taking,and an ability to fly by the seat of his pants. Turner, while a growing force in the industry, was no heavyweight, and several of America's largest television conglomerates were also considering an all-news network - though very cautiously, given the potential this offered for heavy losses. Indeed, at the time of the announcement Turner lacked any clear blueprint, structure, organisation or offices for the new channel he was committed to launching in just 11 months. Just minutes before the Las Vegas press conference, to give credibility to the venture he signed a hurried contract on a sheet of hotel writing paper to hire CNN's first Washington correspondent. What Turner did have was a remarkable instinct for trends in the television industry and a knack of hiring extremely able lieutenants who could translate his grandiose visions into practical ventures. Not long after the Las Vegas meeting, Turner disappeared to indulge his passion for competitive ocean sailing, leaving the detailed planning of the network to the man widely regarded in the industry as the real founder of CNN - television news veteran Reese Schonfeld. Many pundits predicted disaster, particularly when media giant Westinghouse Electric launched a short-lived news station of its own. Forbes magazine said Turner was likely to 'crash in flames.' Yet CNN triumphed and, according to Porter Bibb, has redefined news from 'something that has happened to something that is happening.' Bibb, an investment banker and former journalist, has written a readable biography of Turner, ranging over his remarkable business and yachting achievements (including his 1977 America's Cup victory) and his colourful character and private life. Turner takes the drug lithium to control his violent mood swings, which, says Bibb, are typical manifestations of a manic-depressive illness known as clothymia. Bibb also reckons that unhappiness in Turner's childhood helped turn him into a 'lonely, defiant outsider.' His father, who ran a successful billboard advertising business, sent him to live with his grandparents at the age of three and at the age of six he was sent to boarding school. Throughout his life, says Bibb, Turner has been driven to outdo his remote, harsh father, who committed suicide in 1963 when Turner was just 24. Instead of selling the family business, Turner started to build it up, and took his first steps into broadcasting, buying up radio stations on the grounds that he could use his empty billboards to advertise their programmes. In 1970 he acquired his first television station, a failing Atlanta operation, which he built into America's first super-station offering a combination of entertainment and sport. 'At first,' says a colleague from that time, 'nobody took him seriously. Big mistake. He is eccentric. Maybe even crazy. But Turner's bright and he is driven.' It is Turner's oddball nature, his willingness to take a contrarian position, that has repeatedly brought him business success, often against big odds. The takeover battle currently raging over Paramount Communications, the entertainment group, reflects the growing belief among communications companies that access to programming will be a key to success in the new age of multi-media interactive entertainment. But Turner has acted on that principle since the start of his career. When he was building up the Atlanta super-station he went against conventional wisdom and bought films outright rather than licensing them for a limited number of showings. As long ago as 1981 he opened negotiations with Californian investor Kirk Kerkorian which ultimately led Turner to buy the MGM studio's library of old movies for Dollars 1.2bn in 1986 - a transaction mocked at the time as over-priced but which may turn out to have been shrewd. 'The game I'm in is building assets,' Turner once said, 'and I've never minded overpaying if I know the values are there.' His recent expensive acquisition of two small Hollywood studios, Castle Rock and New Line, fits the same pattern. However, as Bibb notes, the domestic growth of Turner's established channels is likely to slow over the next few years as the US cable market approaches saturation. The company will have to look overseas for growth, where it faces increasing competition, and to new domestic channels or acquisitions. Turner has long been interested in buying a television network and made an abortive bid for CBS in 1985. Bibb suggests that a merger with any of the big three US networks would make business sense, though it might be blocked by the cable companies which hold large stakes in Turner. Still, in the midst of a media takeover wave, no such alliances can be ruled out. Many more chapters remain to be written in the Ted Turner story.
19940409000000000	FT  09 APR 94 / Books: Enter a wimp, exit superman. LISTENING TO PROZAC by Peter D Kramer Fourth Estate Pounds 16, 409 pages Prozac is a drug which, with few side-effects, transforms depressed or anxious people, or those with low self-esteem or poor social skills, into confident, quicker-thinking, more assertive and less inhibited achievers. It is, in short, a 'psychopharmacological cosmetic', a safe chemical personality enhancer; and it is raising a storm of debate. Peter Kramer is a psychiatrist and one of Prozac's earliest prescribers and most eloquent defenders. In this fascinating and sometimes disturbing book he explores the dramatic questions it prompts about mind, selfhood and ethics. The real significance of Prozac lies not so much in its mind-brightening effects as its safety. Other psychotherapeutic drugs carry risks. In promising nearly costless relief from psychological problems - and not mere relief, but enhancement - Prozac opens new possibilities. Is Prozac the miracle drug that can make life easier and more successful for all? The ethical dilemmas thus prompted come attached, as Kramer fascinatingly shows, to other questions. The efficacy of psychotropic drugs suggests that the argument between those who think of mind as a wholly physical entity, and those who think it cannot be explained solely in such terms, is being handsomely won by the former. Among many other things, the success of the biological view suggests that all mental illness reflects brain damage. Kramer argues that such damage, whether caused by genetic factors or trauma, might be degenerative, so that a present mild depression might augur major illness later in life; and that chemical treatment of early signs is important. Should anyone have Prozac who wants it? In effect Kramer says yes. His answer is characteristically American. The stereotypical American assumes that he has a right to a happy, feel-good life. If he has less he feels short-changed. To be worried, or hesitant in speech, or shy; to feel tired, or downhearted; to to have few friends, to be single; all this is failure. Prozac solves the problem. One safe and simple pill a day, and where a wimp entered the telephone box, superman flies out. What is wrong with that? Nothing, except that to erase one's anxiety and sense of struggle is to dull one's contact with reality, to forego the possibility of emotional growth, to lessen one's ability to cope with major grief when it comes, to be less sensitive to oneself and others, to reduce one's autonomy by putting a chemical compound in the place of the personality forged by experience and endeavour and to make one's creativity less fully one's own. To such points Kramer replies that Prozac simply gives people what they would have had if they had enjoyed a 'more benign childhood' and other early advantages. But this precisely exposes the flaw in the pro-Prozac case. You have to make a large value judgment about what life 'should' be like, and about our model of what a successful, flourishing person is, before you can claim that Prozac provides it. Is the American feel-good model the highest ideal of human existence? If autonomy, endeavour, and full contact with the world and other people do not much matter, there seems to be no barrier to following Aldous Huxley's Brave New World suggestion, and adding Prozac to the water supply. Kramer stops short of suggesting as much; but in coming close, he gives us an absorbing insight into scientific and psychological questions that we urgently need to resolve.
19900105000000000	FDA APPROVES DRUG TO TREAT OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER. The Food and Drug Administration has given final approval to a drug to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mental illness thought to afflict at least one in 40 Americans, officials said Thursday. FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said that the agency gave CIBA-Geigy Corp. of Summit, N. J., permission late last week to market clomipramine for use by people whose lives are seriously disrupted by obsessive-compulsive disorder. Kemper said that she did not know how many of the estimated 5 million Americans with the mental disorder -- marked by compulsive, repetitive acts like hand washing or floor scrubbing -- might benefit from the drug. Clomipramine, sold under the trade name Anafranil, has been available on a special case-by-case basis to U.S. patients since June, 1988. It is used in Europe to treat some patients with depression, Kemper said. The drug should be used in obsessive-compulsive disorder cases only when treatments like behavior modification have failed, Kemper said, noting that about 1.5% of the people who took the drug for a year suffered from seizures. Other side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, increased appetite and impotence, she said. David Catlett, a spokesman for CIBA-Geigy, said he could not disclose how much clomipramine would cost or when it would be widely available. The company plans to hold a news conference Tuesday in New York to release marketing details. Dr. Michael Jenike, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said that about 80% to 90% of the obsessive-compulsive patients he has seen require medication such as clomipramine. Jenike estimates that about 85% of people experience "some benefit" from the drug, a success rate he termed "quite remarkable." About 50% of the patients report their symptoms are much better after taking the drug, he said.
19890126000000000	PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS OFTEN MISUSED IN REST HOMES, SURVEY CONCLUDES. Powerful tranquilizers that can cause dangerous side effects are being given to elderly people in rest homes, often by untrained aides without medical supervision, a Massachusetts study found. Such drugs are available only with a doctor's prescription, but many rest home residents continue to be given them months or years after a medical examination, the principal author of the report said Wednesday. "It may well be that when they first started getting the stuff they needed it," said Dr. Jerry Avorn of the Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. "It may be that some people still need it," he said, but without follow-up exams there is no assurance that a drug is being used properly. Medications such as Thorazine and Haldol, designed for treatment of psychotics, can cause tardive dyskinesia, a disfiguring and sometimes irreversible side effect of uncontrollable facial twitches, he said. Avorn said that use of such drugs is not being limited to treatment of psychoses. "Sometimes they are used as sedatives, and that's not a good idea, because they will have side effects that outweigh their advantages," he said. Too large a dose of a psychiatric drug also can aggravate confusion or lethargy, thereby increasing the risk that patients will fall and injure themselves, Avorn said. Avorn, with Stephen B. Soumerai of Harvard and Paul Dreyer and Kathleen Connelly of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, surveyed 55 rest homes in the state. The institutions care for elderly people who are not sick enough to be in nursing homes but are too frail to live on their own, Avorn said. The findings were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
19890126000000000	RITES FOR BLUDGEON VICTIMS; MOURNERS GIVEN NO REASONS WHY 2 DIED. Two little girls sat on a hard wooden bench Wednesday, oblivious to the mood of grief within the First Presbyterian Church in Santa Ana, while a minister spoke of two untimely deaths. "The way that they died, so unexpectedly, so unexplainedly, so unnecessarily and so tragically has touched us all, whether we knew (them) or not," said the Rev. Mike Pulsifer, pastor of the church. "Why this happened, I do not know." The girls' mother, Helen Lynch, 35, and their 13-month-old sister, Natalie, were buried in a private ceremony Wednesday morning, and about 60 friends and neighbors gathered at the church just after noon for a memorial service. Across town, less than a mile away, the girls' father, Joseph Peter Lynch, 43, sat in a jail cell on suspicion of fatally bludgeoning the mother and infant with a champagne bottle. In his sermon, Pulsifer spoke to the anguished quest for answers in the aftermath of a horrible event. He talked of the virtues of mother and daughter, two innocents in a family tragedy. Only near the end did he acknowledge Joseph Lynch: "Grant him peace, oh God, and keep us from passing judgment." For now, there are questions, raised by Lynch's attorney and psychiatrist, about Lynch's history of mental problems and what role they will play in his defense. And there are questions about what will become of the fragments of the family left behind. Like many of Orange County's residents, the Lynches were transplants. He is Scottish, and Helen was Australian. They had lived in Santa Ana 4 years. But in that short time, say neighbors and friends, they became well-entrenched in the community. Work had brought them here. An engineer for an international company, Joseph Lynch had transplanted his family to Canada, Mexico and Italy before California. Helen Lynch devoted herself to her children. Their daughters Holly, 9, and Angela, 4, were in Girl Scouts and Brownies. One daughter played on a soccer team. "They were a very loving family," said Stan Taylor, president of the homeowners association in the apartment complex where they lived. "A lot of times, we've said that we wish other kids in the complex were as well-behaved as the Lynch kids were." Taylor remembers Lynch as the model of stability. "If I had to pick 100 people who I thought would do something terrible, he would not even make the list," Taylor said.  'Very Brutal Attack' But in the early hours of Jan. 17, Joseph Lynch called Santa Ana police to report a homicide. Police found Helen Lynch battered and lifeless on the floor of the family's condominium. Her daughter lay in her arms, suffering from blows to her head. A police spokeswoman called it a "very brutal attack." Initially, Lynch said someone else had been responsible, police reported. Then, he changed his story and said he had been responsible. Police found the other two girls in their room, under a cover, apparently unharmed. Friends, family and Lynch's psychiatrist say Joseph Lynch suffered from manic depression. Two years ago, said his psychiatrist, Dr. Richard S. Rose, he was hospitalized for the condition. "He had some problems and his wife recognized the problems and suggested to him that he seek help, and he did," Rose said. He had been on the medication lithium since that time, Rose said, and "he had done beautifully on the medication." But Rose said that Lynch apparently had stopped taking his medicine, and his wife noticed changes in his behavior. On the day before she died, Helen Lynch had called Rose's office to make an appointment for him. "There was no urgency about the call," Rose said. Dr. Lawrence Greene, a psychiatrist who oversees quality assurance for the county's mental health system, said about 0.5% to 1.2% of the U.S. population suffers from manic depression. Those who suffer from the illness, he said, experience manic episodes characterized by a decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, racing thoughts and increased irrational activity that may include overspending. Sometimes, he said, the manic episodes are short, and other times they can last for months. The episodes might also trigger delusions, and in that case, "it is possible for the person to become violent." The episodes can be controlled with medication, namely lithium. Uncontrolled, the disease will cause more frequent, and sometimes more intense, episodes, Greene said. Brian Ducker, a public defender who is serving as Lynch's attorney, is ordering a psychological evaluation for his client and said an insanity plea is a possibility. He said Lynch is being monitored closely in a medical unit at a county jail ward. Lynch is scheduled to be arraigned on two charges of murder Friday, but Ducker said he will ask for a continuance until Lynch undergoes the testing. "Given his present mental state, I don't think even his friends ought to talk to him about this case," Ducker said. Those close to Lynch were aware of his condition, but said his behavior never frightened them. Helen Lynch's mother, Joan Stuart, had visited the family several times, and stayed with them several weeks last year, when Natalie was born. Nothing about Joseph Lynch's behavior worried her, she said. "Not at all, because he was treated for that and he was going along well, as far as I knew," she said.  Unusual Behavior Said Pulsifer, pastor of First Presbyterian: "Helen must not have been that afraid, or she would not have let the kids stay there, because I know how much she cared for those kids." Rose said it is highly unusual for a person who suffers from manic depression to act in a way that is radically different from his behavior during other manic episodes. "Sudden, unpredictable behavior is Hollywood, Class B stuff," he said. "We don't see people who are unpredictable that way. "There is an element of unpredictability about this illness, but what is usual is the predictability of the bizarreness of behavior," he said. The incident has left the family in a tangle of legal questions regarding the surviving children and Joseph Lynch's case. The family had no relatives in the United States, so their guardianship is a matter that will have to be determined by a juvenile court. The two girls were living in the Orangewood Children's Home until late last week, when a juvenile court granted Stuart temporary custody. No permanent arrangement has been determined. The British consul in Los Angeles is monitoring Lynch's case to make sure his rights as a non-citizen are respected, but consulate spokesman Angus Mackay said Lynch will have to go through the system "just as anyone here does." This weekend, Stuart met her son-in-law's family for the first time. Lynch's brother, John, from West Germany, and his sister, Mary, from Scotland, arrived in Santa Ana on Sunday.  'We're Just Managing' "It was a very awkward meeting for all of us," Stuart said. "We really just talked in a very general way about the children. "We're just living one day at a time," Stuart said. "We're just managing." In the church's library Wednesday afternoon, Stuart accepted condolences from many people she had never met. Sitting next to her was Sharon Portman, a neighbor who has been close to the Lynch family. Stuart and the two girls are staying with Portman and husband Michael Fults. Holly and Angela ran about with other children, sharing books, secure in the company of friends of a few years. Lynch's brother and sister sat in a corner of the library, apart from the crowd of neighbors and friends. They were asked about their brother. "Perhaps it's best to wait on this thing," John Lynch said, as his sister dabbed at tears.
19890220000000000	IN BRIEF: ANTI-COCAINE DRUG REPORTED. Physicians believe they may have found a drug that can dramatically reduce the craving for cocaine and that could lead to successful treatments for cocaine addiction. A preliminary, unpublished study by psychiatrists at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine in Minneapolis showed that carbamazepine, a drug long used to prevent seizures and treat certain forms of depression, can control cocaine cravings well enough for addicts to benefit from more traditional forms of treatment. With traditional therapy alone -- withdrawal from the cocaine along with psychotherapy -- more than 80% of addicts go back to using cocaine within a year after leaving treatment. "Cocaine treatment fails because patients are trapped by craving, by a compulsion to use cocaine," said Dr. James Halikas, co-director of the chemical dependency treatment program at the University of Minnesota and study director. "We feel that we may have found (a drug) . . . that cures or that eliminates craving." Many drug-abuse researchers think that cocaine, which activates the brain's pleasure centers, is the most addictive of regularly abused drugs.
19890319000000000	COMPUTER HACKER WITH A GENIUS IQ CHOOSES STREET LIFE. In the small park in front of Horton Plaza, the downtown shopping mall, the usual assortment of drifters, derelicts and screaming street corner proselytizers are gathered on a warm afternoon. Among them is William Troy Landreth, a young homeless man with a genius-level IQ who at age 18 became an underground hero to computer hackers nationwide. A pioneer in the craft, he was known at the height of his fame only by his code name: The Cracker. To authorities, including the FBI, Landreth was a security threat, a teen-ager who used a personal computer and telephone in his bedroom in suburban Poway, north of San Diego, to tap into supposedly secure computer networks used by the Department of Defense and NASA, among others. In a highly publicized crackdown, the FBI came down on Landreth and a handful of the other original hackers. It was 1983, the same year of the popular movie "War Games," in which a young computer hacker almost starts World War III by mistake. Computer trespassing was so new then that there was no federal law against it. The government finally turned to one of the oldest "high-technology" laws on the books: wire fraud. Landreth eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, was fined $87 for using someone else's computer time and placed on three years' probation. The crime brought Landreth notoriety, led him to write a book about his exploits that will soon be reprinted and provided him with work as a consultant who showed companies how to ward off computer intruders like himself. Today, the 24-year-old Landreth spends his nights in homeless shelters, if he can get in. Sometimes, when he is organized enough to get money, he rents a flophouse room. Otherwise, a concrete doorway passes for a bed. He doesn't drink alcohol but he smokes marijuana as often as he can get it, he said. And he prefers passing sunny afternoons lounging in a small park in front of Horton Plaza.  Very Polite His hair is brown and shoulder-length; he has a wispy mustache and he is thin for someone 5-feet-8. He is extremely polite, a trait he's always had, according to friends and family. Though he is sociable, he is introverted. He has never had a driver's license and relies on buses for transportation. His IQ has been measured at 163, well into the genius category. Landreth said he has been diagnosed as a manic depressive, and, after a court-ordered psychiatric exam, was prescribed several anti-depressant and mood-enhancing drugs. But they all made him worse, he said, and he stopped taking them. The last was lithium, which he hasn't had in a long time. What has remained, however, are the deep valleys of depression. In interviews with The Times, Landreth was straightforward and lucid, though he often punctuated his sentences with smiles and muted laughter, as though privy to inside jokes or playing a game. Occasionally, his conversation rambled, then suddenly became very precise. He is, he said, despite his current condition, confident in his ability to control computers and to be paid handsomely for doing so. All he has to do, he said, is turn on his switch.  Still Confident "I could set up a data base system for a company and walk away with a few thousand dollars for five or six hours work, and they'd never regret it," he said. "The five or six thousand for five or six hours of work would interest me, but I haven't fallen for it. "I didn't inherit a great deal of money that's been accumulating for several eons, so I wouldn't know how to look at money." Landreth, the eldest of nine children, was 13 when he bought his first computer at the local Radio Shack store, using money his parents paid him for baby-sitting. "He really took an interest in it," said his mother, Susan Fourmyle, who lives in Vista. Both Landreth and his mother said he had much freedom as a young teen-ager, freedom to come and go and freedom to sit in his bedroom for 20 hours at a time playing with his computer. Part of the reason, he said, is that his parents were occupied chasing their own Utopian dreams, moving from Poway to Alaska to Hawaii and back to California in the mid-'80s. Eight years ago, Landreth's parents changed their last name to Fourmyle, taking on the name of a character in the science-fiction novel "The Star's My Destination" by Alfred Bester. Landreth's father, Gulliver, formerly in the import-export business, is a fledgling science-fiction writer given to sweeping mood swings that require him to take lithium, according to his wife, Susan.  'Kind of Sad' She said in an interview that she thinks her son, whom she rarely sees, and her husband are afflicted with similar demons. "It's really kind of sad," she said. "Billy needs psychiatric help. He needs lithium. He doesn't recognize he has a problem. "I suggested he get treatment, but he thought we were calling him crazy and took it very negatively," Susan Fourmyle said. "I'm real concerned about him . . . what he's doing is a dangerous way to live." Landreth's closest friend is Tom Anderson, who met "The Cracker" long before he ever met the person. Anderson was 13 or 14 when he found "The Cracker" through a computer bulletin board. "I looked up to him a lot," said Anderson, now 18, of Escondido. "He knew everything." And Landreth passed on his knowledge to his friend. The FBI confiscated Anderson's computer equipment in 1985 because he had entered Chase Manhattan Bank's computer network, and, at age 14, he was sentenced to a one-year probation. Anderson and Landreth talk by phone about once a week, and Landreth keeps his computer at Anderson's home, where he occasionally drops by to do some work. Anderson, who has written and had published a book on telecommunications programs, said his friend has always been mysterious but has never seemed quite as out of touch as he is now. "Before he was just real smart, even though his ideas were a bit strange. But he was just Bill," Anderson said. "Now I think something is wrong . . . he said he wanted to live on the streets because he wanted to experience being a minority."  Seemed in Control While Anderson was having his legal problems, Landreth seemed in control of his life in 1985 and 1986. He was giving lectures to business executives, doing free-lance computer work for corporations and was promoting his book, "Out of the Inner Circle," in cities throughout the country. His publisher, Microsoft Press of Redmond, Wash., said the book has sold about 68,000 copies since it was first printed in 1984. The book's name was taken from Landreth's secret society of elite hackers called the Inner Circle. "We were explorers, not spies," his book said, "and to us, damaging computer files was not only clumsy and inelegant, it was wrong." To this day, he maintains that the only reason he was indicted was that the FBI wanted to send a message to hackers throughout the country. "There wasn't an accusation of danger in the whole charge," Landreth said. "The FBI really needed to crack down on hacking, mostly because of the 'War Games' movie. They could only get a lead onto some simple crimes . . . that really aren't crimes at all." Landreth was accused of breaking into the Virginia-based GTE Telemail electronic mail network, where he peeked at National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Defense Department computer correspondence, and set up files surreptitiously for his and other hackers' personal use.  Disappearance The lawbreaking behind him, Landreth appeared to have found himself. But in September, 1986, he disappeared, leaving the screen of his IBM-PC computer at Anderson's home glowing with an uncompleted sentence. And he had written a rambling, esoteric eight-page essay that touched upon such subjects as man's evolution and immortality, communism and capitalism, nuclear war and greed, and suicide. "I was bored in school, bored traveling around the country, bored getting raided by the FBI, bored in prison, bored writing books, bored being bored. I will probably be bored dead, but this is my risk to take," read the last page. After drifting for almost a year, Landreth turned up in the small Oregon town of McMinnville, near Portland, where a woman called the police after Landreth had wandered near her yard and asked for a drink of water. He was dirty and barefoot, and he was arrested for violating his probation and sent back to San Diego. When he returned, federal Judge Rudi Brewster, who throughout the legal process has tried to guide the troubled Landreth rather than punish him, extended his probation. To his surprise, Landreth also discovered that he had about $9,000 waiting for him in book royalties from foreign sales. He rented a Poway apartment, set up a word processor and paid his attorney. But the apartment burned in May, Landreth ran out of cash, and "then I came here (downtown San Diego), where it's simple to live."  More Troubles There are, however, complications to that simplicity. He has been robbed of his stereo radio by a street tough who enticed him into a game of three-card monte and he has accumulated several citations from police for infractions such as sleeping in public, riding the trolley without a ticket and jaywalking. He never pays the fines or goes to court, even though he knows this could eventually land him in jail. "I'm not really part of their organization, and I really don't think about it as being important," he said. Two weeks ago, after he was stopped on the street by police and found to be in violation of his probation, Judge Brewster terminated his probation, noting that the courts could do nothing to help Landreth. "I think we had really exhausted what can be done," Landreth's lawyer, Peter J. Hughes, said after the March 6 hearing. "We were trying to be his parents, and we can't be. This is really no longer something that the criminal justice system can accomplish." Although Landreth tries to keep up on the rapidly changing world of computers by reading technical magazines at the downtown central library, he admits he's behind. Nonetheless, he recently wrote a seven-page essay on computer viruses that will be included in the reprinting of his book.  'Disappointment' "The way I see it, I could be retired in five or 10 years, if I did things in a constructive way . . . but I haven't decided to do that," Landreth said. "The disappointment I have in life is mostly for the general population, I think. I don't think they see their institutions at all. I think they're still 200 or 300 years old, still serving a state long ago. Things could change for the better." As for the immediate future, Landreth said that he will probably remain on the streets and that he may move again, perhaps to Los Angeles or farther north. "It's difficult to say what might happen, overall. Every 30 seconds is highly unpredictable," Landreth said. "I'm usually working on a system of feedback that I don't try and second-guess. I would say that's how I'm working." It's his personal definition of freedom, his choice, the way he wants to live, even though he knows some of his friends and his family believe he is confused and wasting his life. "I don't know what (freedom) is good for any more than anyone else knows what it's good for," he said, the Chesire cat in him surfacing. "So it's really in how you look at it."
19900404000000000	PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: POPULAR ANTIDEPRESSANT PROZAC CARRIES SOME CAUTIONS. The hot drug of the 1970s was Valium (diazepam). At its peak, more than 60 million prescriptions were filled each year. People treated the little blue or yellow pills almost as casually as aspirin. In the 1980s, Xanax took over top billing for psychoactive drugs. Now a new contender is grabbing the spotlight. Unlike Valium and Xanax, the superstar drug of the 1990s does not relieve anxiety. It is an antidepressant, a type of medicine that's long been regarded by both doctors and patients as necessary but unpleasant. Previous antidepressants saved people from suicide and helped them shake off the immobility of despair, but they rarely made people feel great. Many antidepressants left people feeling sluggish and "spaced out." People often gained weight and developed a dry mouth, constipation, disturbed concentration and sexual dysfunction. Prozac (fluoxetine), the new head drug of the '90s, doesn't cause weight gain or sedation. And it has received far more recognition than any other antidepressant. With cover stories in Newsweek and New York magazine, Prozac has become a household name. Sales zoomed to $350 million last year, more than double the previous year's total. There's a reason for such popularity. Cheryl was overweight, depressed, tired a lot of the time and compulsive about neatness. Her son's messy room drove her wild. To keep everything in its place, she spent hours each day tidying up. It was a constant source of friction. Her doctor had tried her on amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, but it made her fatigue and weight problem worse. She decided she could live with the depression rather than gain more weight. Shortly after Prozac was introduced, her doctor wrote her a prescription. It changed Cheryl's life. She felt energetic and optimistic and stopped screaming at her family. An added bonus -- she started to lose weight for the first time in years. But there is a darker side to Prozac. Just as Valium and Xanax lost popularity as people learned about complications, Prozac may lose its glamour when people realize there are side effects. Some people develop insomnia and feel jittery and anxious. Nausea, tremors, sweating and sexual problems are also possible. More disturbing is the report that Prozac may lead a small number of people to consider suicide. Harvard researchers recently reported six cases in which patients on Prozac developed "intense, violent suicidal thoughts." A spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company sees "no trend that Prozac has any relationship to suicide, suicide ideation, attempts or successful suicides any more than other therapeutic interventions in patients with depression." As popular as Prozac is becoming, no one yet knows the long-term safety of this antidepressant.
19900425000000000	PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ANTIDEPRESSANT NOT CERTAIN CULPRIT IN GIRL'S SUICIDE. Question: My daughter committed suicide in 1988 one month after being put on a new medicine called Prozac. She was not depressed; Prozac was prescribed for an eating disorder. We believe Prozac is responsible for her suicide. She did not seem suicidal before she started taking this medicine, and even the day before she hanged herself, she promised to take care of her neighbors' cat while they were on vacation. Have you ever heard of another case of someone committing suicide while taking Prozac? Answer: We are so sorry to hear about your daughter's horrible death, and we extend our sympathy. We know of no similar case. Prozac (fluoxetine) has rapidly become the most successful antidepressant of all time. Several weeks ago it was featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine, and more than 650,000 prescriptions are filled each month. What makes Prozac so popular is its side-effect profile. Instead of making people feel sluggish and drowsy, this new antidepressant is more likely to energize or stimulate. It is far less likely to cause constipation, dry mouth or weight gain. In fact, people on Prozac may actually lose weight. Despite its swift rise to stardom, Prozac does have a darker side. It can cause insomnia and jitteriness. Some people complain of nausea, sexual difficulties, tremor and headache. Of greater concern is a recent report in the American Journal of Psychiatry (February, 1990). Psychiatrists at Harvard report that six depressed but non-suicidal patients developed "intense, violent suicidal preoccupation after two to seven weeks of fluoxetine treatment." Although none of these patients committed suicide, this report does suggest that doctors warn patients of the danger. There is no way to tell if Prozac was responsible for your daughter's act. The company assures us that it has no data indicating that depressed people are more likely to think about suicide while on Prozac than while on any other treatment. Q: Can chromium supplements stabilize blood sugar? A: New research suggests that chromium has a beneficial effect on glucose tolerance, a measure of blood sugar. Volunteers were given chromium supplements (200 micrograms) for 14 weeks. When they were tested at the end of the study, blood sugar rose only half as far as it had at the beginning. The scientists will look next to see if chromium supplements can benefit Type II diabetics, who do not need to take insulin.
19890507000000000	HEAT DEATH OF MENTAL PATIENT INVESTIGATED. San Bernardino County prosecutors have launched an investigation to determine whether criminal negligence contributed to the death of a mental patient who had been subjected to 110-degree heat while locked in a room at Patton State Hospital. Francisco Morfin, 23, of Los Angeles died last September shortly after being found slumped in a chair with a body temperature of 104.6 degrees, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Hackleman. The coroner's office attributed Morfin's death to a toxic effect related to the drug lithium, widely prescribed for people with mental disorders. A deputy coroner said toxicity was caused by the combination of the high room temperature, dehydration caused by lithium and clogged arteries.
19900526000000000	COMMON DRUGS MAY INHIBIT SEXUAL ACTIVITY; MEDICINE: AT LEAST 200 MEDICATIONS -- BOTH OVER-THE-COUNTER AND PRESCRIPTION -- CAN AFFECT PERFORMANCE OR ENJOYMENT.. Is your sex life in shambles? Check to see what's in the medicine cabinet before heading to the doctor or sex therapist. Some widely used drugs can cause side effects that upset the delicate balance of the human libido or trigger physical problems that interfere with sexual fulfillment. Topping the list of culprits are blood-pressure pills and psychiatric drugs. But at least 200 medications -- both prescription and over-the-counter -- are known to influence sexual performance or enjoyment, says pharmacist M. Laurence Lieberman, author of "The Sexual Pharmacy" (New American Library, $18.95). Dr. Taylor Segraves, a psychiatry professor at Case Western Reserve medical school in Cleveland, said studies indicate about half of all sexual problems stem from physical causes and perhaps 10% of those cases are linked to drug side effects. "It's not a huge number, but if you happen to be one of those patients, it is quite significant," Segraves said. For people experiencing sexual difficulties, Segraves recommends that they make a list of what medications they have been taking -- and when they started using them -- and bring it along when they visit a doctor or sex therapist. "Most of the anti-hypertensive drugs may cause problems with male ejaculation or getting an erection," Segraves said, noting that studies have generally looked at the impact of the high-blood pressure drugs on male, not female, sexual activity. One type of anti-hypertensive that appears relatively free of sexual side effects are angiotensin-converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors, he said. Another class of drugs notorious for causing sexual problems are medications to alleviate mental disorders. Anti-psychotics like chlorprothixene and haloperidol have been reported to inhibit both ejaculation and orgasm, Segraves said. Lieberman also noted that some males taking haloperidol for Tourette's syndrome have experienced a decreased sex drive. In addition to creating difficulties similar to those caused by anti-psychotics, some tricyclic anti-depressants may interfere with the ability to get an erection, while monoamine oxidase-blocking anti-depressants can delay the ability to reach orgasm or ejaculation. Another bothersome drug from a sexual standpoint may be the acne-fighting drug isotretinoin or Accutane. A large-scale study found that 13% of females and 7% of males had a lowered sex drive after about one month of Accutane therapy, Lieberman said. There have also been reports of the tranquilizer Valium and other members of the benzodiazepine drug family inhibiting ejaculation. In fact, Segraves said, some of those medications, which depress the central nervous system, have been used in small doses to help men plagued by premature ejaculation. In the past, doctors had generally thought diuretics -- often prescribed for people with high blood pressure -- had no harmful effect on sex. But recently, some older men using the drugs have reported problems, Segraves said. In addition to sexual shortfalls, some medications also may lead to troublesome excesses. The benzodiazepines may lower people's normal social anxieties, prompting them to engage in sexual behavior they would normally shun. Drugs that increase levels of the brain chemical dopamine, such as levadopa for Parkinson's disease, have been reported to cause spontaneous -- and sometimes inappropriate -- erections in some patients. In one study, 10 of 41 patients treated with levadopa showed an increase in sexual activity. In a bizarre association, a couple of patients taking clomipramine, a drug recently approved for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, have reported spontaneous orgasms when they yawned. What should someone do who suspects a medication may be playing havoc with his or her sexual enjoyment? Segraves said the first step should be to find a doctor or other medical professional who takes the complaint seriously. In the past, many doctors have steered clear of discussions about patients' sexual problems or dismissed such difficulties as medically unimportant. Younger physicians should have received better training about the sexual side effects of drugs and may also be more open to discussing sexual matters, although some may overlook the role of sex in an older person's life, Segraves said. If the problem does appear to be linked to drugs, a doctor may be able to lower a patient's dosage or switch them to a different class of drugs. "The patient and doctor have to have a good relationship. It may take a couple months of experimenting to find a drug that works," Segraves said. If changing drugs or lowering the dose would endanger health, Segraves said, a patient, after checking with a physician, may want to postpone taking an evening or morning dose of the drug until after he or she has intercourse. If delaying medication is also out of the question, a patient should not despair, he said. Patients can learn to enjoy other forms of sexual intimacy. Some men, said Segraves, may be able to artificially induce erection through drug injections, and in rare cases, a man may decide to have a penile prosthesis surgically implanted.  SIDE EFFECTS FROM SOME DRUGS While their impact on sexuality may not be as dramatic as prescription drugs, some common over-the-counter medications can produce side effects that can disrupt -- or enhance -- sex and fertility. Here is a short list of examples compiled from "The Sexual Pharmacy" (New American Library, $18.95) by pharmacist M. Laurence Lieberman: Aspirin: May help improve male infertility by reducing inflammation of the genital tract. Brompheniramine: As little as 16 milligrams daily of this antihistamine has been reported to reverse the occasional problem of backward ejaculation in diabetics. Diphenhydramine: This antihistamine and several related drugs have been found to inhibit the movement of sperm, which could result in decreased fertility. Ibuprofen: At a maximum daily dose of 1,200 milligrams, it may delay the start of menstruation up to 14 days. It may also reduce fertility-impairing inflammation in men. L-tryptophan: Sexual disinhibition, such as lewd comments and inappropriate touching, have been reported among people given large doses on an empty stomach. This dietary supplement was recently recalled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after it was linked to a serious blood disorder. Vitamin D: May lower the sex drive if supplement is given at doses above 12,000 units per day.
19900527000000000	LACK OF COMMUNICATION OVER MEDICATION FUELS PROBLEMS FOR ELDERLY. Dorothy Buth, 80, was taking six medications when she entered Burbank's St. Joseph Medical Center last month. When she went home a few days later, her family physician replaced two medications with new prescriptions. Unfortunately, no one mentioned the changes to Buth's daughter, Bonnie, who monitors her mother's prescriptions. And no one told the Adult Day Health Care Center of St. Joseph, which cares for Buth five days a week and administers most of her medications. "I was on the phone going back and forth to the doctors," Bonnie Buth said. "I had a little of all her medications left. I didn't know what to give her. I was going crazy." "She's a heart patient and the situation could have been very dangerous," said Susan Myers, the program nurse for the Adult Day Health Care Center. "If she had been on her own, the potential for taking all the drugs, or too many of them, would have been there." Recent studies suggest that Buth's case is symptomatic of a disturbing problem among older adults taking prescription or over-the-counter medications. Federal, state and private studies say that an alarming number of Americans 60 and older take medications that cause harm by themselves or through adverse reactions with other prescriptions. The problem is exacerbated by physiological changes, including a decline in kidney and liver performance, that make elderly people more sensitive to drugs. Myers said the problem develops from inadequate communication between doctors and patients about prescriptions and their possible side effects. Bonnie Buth averted trouble by aggressively pursuing doctors to learn what dosages to give her mother, Myers said. But many other senior citizens have been less fortunate. A 1989 report by the United States Inspector General, for example, called mismedication of seniors "a critical health care issue." The report said that in 1987 at least 200,000 elderly Americans were hospitalized due to adverse drug reactions or experienced drug reactions while hospitalized. It also found that each year prescription drugs cause 32,000 older adults to fall and fracture their hips. In addition, it reported that 61,000 senior citizens who take medications develop tremors, rigid muscles or other side effects resembling Parkinson's disease. The problem is also extensive -- and costly -- in California. A state Assembly study found that in 1986, patients 60 or older accounted for "62% of reported adverse drug reactions associated with legally administered drug therapies." The cost of hospitalizing these 31,326 senior citizens was $289 million. The problem is significant in the San Fernando Valley, said Dr. Roland Jacobs of the Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys. Jacobs, the medical director of the hospital's special care unit for geriatric psychiatry, recalls a woman who was brought to the emergency room babbling and delirious. She had no sense of herself or the time of day. She was extremely agitated and restless and had no control of her bowels or bladder. Jacobs learned that when the elderly woman had become agitated during early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, a family doctor had prescribed tranquilizers and anti-psychotic drugs while she continued to take medications for high blood pressure. Within weeks the woman became increasingly agitated and psychotic. Instead of re-evaluating her medications, the doctor increased them. This cycle continued for several months until the woman came to the hospital. "We basically stopped her medications and observed her," Jacobs said. "Within three days she made significant improvement by just detoxifying and washing out all these medicines. In about seven days she had come back to her normal status. "We re-evaluated her. All she needed were light tranquilizers along with her medication for high blood pressure. We also made recommendations for improving her home life and lowering her stress so that she did not require as many medications." Jacobs also recalls treating an 88-year-old widow who had difficulty walking and had fallen, requiring stitches on her ear, the day she was brought to the hospital. She was talking incessantly and was delirious. A doctor had prescribed Haldol, an anti-psychotic, to treat a slight case of nervousness. For five days, the medication seemed to work well. But on the sixth day her agitation returned and she became confused. The next day she experienced difficulty walking, became delirious and went to the hospital. Jacobs took her off Haldol. Four days later she could walk. Although still suffering from severe memory loss, she became less confused and needed only a mild sedative. "It was clearly a case of Haldol toxicity," Jacobs said. "Her family doctor needed to know that it accumulates in the elderly and what may not be toxic initially can become so after six or seven days." The inspector general's report said a predominant reason that elderly people are more likely than other groups to be mismedicated is that they suffer more chronic illnesses and use more medications. Although Americans 65 and over "constitute only 12% of the population, they use over 30% of the prescription drugs and 40% of the non-prescription drugs," according to the report. The report added that because elderly Americans take a greater variety of drugs, the risk is higher that the medications will interact adversely. The report said the elderly also suffer because many physicians are poorly trained in geriatrics. It cited a 1988 study that said less than 2% of students in medical school were required to take courses in geriatric medicine. Mike Mangano, a deputy inspector general in Washington, said physicians get some information on drugs from scientific publications but get more of their information from drug company representatives who are trying to sell a product. "In 1988, drug companies spent $2.5 billion on promoting their products to physicians," he said. "They say that they get scientific literature all the time. But I think if they are honest, they will tell you that they are heavily influenced by promotional people from the drug companies." Dr. David Chernof, a Northridge internist who is president-elect of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., said the assertion that physicians receive insufficient training in geriatric medicine is "not backed by any data that I'm aware of." "I think the inspector general would be well advised to have a doctor help him with these evaluations in the future," he said." "It does not reach the heart of the matter to say that only 2% of medical students take courses in geriatric medicine because that is not necessarily where they get the information on pharmacology for elderly people. "They get it in courses in pharmacology and in internal medicine and in bedside teaching on the hospital wards. Much of traditional pharmacology courses . . . in medical school have to do with issues of fine tuning dosage according to age and coexistence of other medical conditions. "Doctors are required . . . to have a substantial number of hours of formal education each year. Much of that is provided in lectures in hospitals and those lectures often have to do with exactly these issues. They are not given by drug companies but by skilled physicians experienced in these matters." The recent studies of over-medication sparked interest among politicians. State Sen. David Roberti, a Democrat representing Burbank and part of North Hollywood, introduced one of several bills on the subject now before the state legislature. "It's a vast problem and getting worse," Roberti said. "The problem is that there has to be some way of keeping a list of what medications a senior citizen is taking because of the adverse reactions that can occur." Roberti's bill (SB 2815) would require the state to develop a brochure to teach patients what to ask about medications. Doctors and pharmacists would be obligated to give older patients a copy of the brochure. The bill would also compel doctors and pharmacists to take complete information about patient's medications and to advise them about possible "effects or contraindications." Chernof said doctors are taught in medical schools and urged by professional canon to counsel patients about adverse reactions and drug interactions. Brad Williams, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy and clinical gerontology at USC, said the American Pharmaceutical Assn. includes counseling patients as one of its standards of practice. But Williams said pharmacists in high-volume stores often are too busy to counsel patients, and that Roberti's bill would make a good law because "it raises the issue of drug medication counseling and will encourage people to ask for it." Medical groups might have a different opinion once they have time to study the legislation. Dr. Alex Pruchnicki, geriatrics fellow at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Medical Center, said good physicians already take histories of their patients' prescriptions and discuss possible side effects. He said physicians might oppose legislative intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship. Chernof questioned the data that fueled the proposal. "Who decided what an adverse drug reaction was?" he asked. "What were the criteria? In an elderly person with multiple system illness such as diabetes and heart disease, for example, it's difficult to call an incident an adverse drug reaction because sometimes it's difficult to distinguish a manifestation of the illness from the purported adverse reaction." Chernof said other causes frequently contribute to adverse reactions, including failure to follow directions, misunderstandings of directions, the patient's forgetfulness, difficulty opening bottles, difficulty reading labels and self-advised changes in dosages of medication. Chernof said physicians and pharmacists need to educate patients, but he wondered if a booklet was the best way. "Will elderly patients read it? Will they pay any more attention to it than to what the doctor said? . . . If a pharmacist raises an issue about possible drug interaction, the net effect may be to scare the patient away from taking the drug at all."
19900718000000000	PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DES USED AGAINST MISCARRIAGES AND AS CONTRACEPTIVE. Question: In a recent column, you described DES as a morning-after pill and said it was taken years ago by pregnant women. You didn't say why, leaving the impression that these women were trying to abort their pregnancies. That's not true at all! Back in the 1950s we women were given DES to try to prevent miscarriages. I'd hate for my children -- or anyone else -- to think I was trying to end a pregnancy when I took DES. Answer: You are quite right that DES (diethylstilbestrol) was prescribed from the 1940s through the 1960s in the hopes of preventing miscarriages. It wasn't prescribed as a morning-after contraceptive until the 1970s. Because you took DES during pregnancy, your daughter (if you had one) should be careful to get regular gynecological exams, as she may be at higher risk of certain cancers or ectopic pregnancy. Q: Will SOD pills sold in health food stores help arthritis and relieve pain? A: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is digested in the stomach and is unlikely to be absorbed or help arthritis. Q: For years I suffered deep depressions. It was a nightmare, and none of the many medications prescribed to me really helped. Since I was put on Prozac my life has turned around. I feel great. Just thought you should have some perspective to counteract some of the bad things you have said about this wonderful drug. A. There is no doubt that Prozac (fluoxetine) has helped many people. It relieves depression and does not produce some of the side effects most common to other antidepressant medications. As beneficial as Prozac may be, though, some people do experience adverse reactions. One reader wrote to say she had to stop taking this drug due to "anxiety, headache, decreased appetite and concentration, weight loss, and terrible insomnia."
19900728000000000	STAR DRUG PROZAC BECOMES LILLY LIABILITY. Prozac, a depression remedy that has been a star performer for pharmaceuticals giant Eli Lilly & Co., has turned into a sudden liability in the wake of recent lawsuits targeting the drug. Though Indianapolis-based Lilly defends the safety of Prozac, noting that more than 2 million people have taken the prescription drug, analysts worry about the effect of negative news on a drug that is becoming increasingly important to Lilly. Two suits filed in the last two weeks blame Prozac for inducing violent thoughts in a New York woman, who slashed herself hundreds of times, and in a Kentucky man, who shot and killed seven people and wounded 13 others before killing himself at a printing plant in Louisville last year. As a result, Lilly, whose sales and earnings have been rising partly on the strength of Prozac, has been taking a beating on Wall Street. The stock dropped $4.375 on Thursday. Before the suits hit the headlines, Lilly's stock had been moving up. It closed at $88.50 on July 16, the day before the first suit was filed. Lilly's shares inched up 87.5 cents in heavy trading Friday to close at $80.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.28 points. Slightly more than 1.9 million shares traded, making Lilly the seventh most actively traded stock on the exchange. "I view the lawsuits themselves as a non-event. . . . There really is no scientific basis for the complaint. People who are depressed are suicidal anyway," said Rita Freedman, an analyst with Provident National Bank in Philadelphia. However, she said, the issue of concern to Lilly is the possibility of additional lawsuits and more "negative publicity" about a drug that is very important to the company financially. Freedman estimated that sales from the drug have already reached about $385 million this year, compared to about $350 million for all of last year. Analysts expect Prozac sales to top $650 million this year and to hit $1 billion in 1991. "It is indeed nail-biting time (for Lilly) because you just don't know what eventually will happen" in the political arena and before a jury, said Viren Mehta, partner in Mehta & Isaly, a New York-based pharmaceutical research group. "But at the moment there is no reason to believe that there is anything wrong with the way Prozac works or the way Eli Lilly has marketed Prozac," he said. Added Richard R. Stover, an analyst with the Alex. Brown & Sons brokerage firm, "There definitely is a concern that patients who can truly benefit from the drug could be scared away from continuing to use it, or some physicians may be scared away from prescribing it." A Lilly spokesman could not be reached for comment Friday, but the company said in a statement that the murderer in the Kentucky case, Joseph Wesbecker, "had a lengthy history of psychiatric disturbance, including suicide attempts and homicidal threats prior to taking Prozac. It would not appear that Prozac caused this behavior." Since it was introduced in December, 1987, sales of Prozac have soared because it has fewer side effects than drugs previously available. It was the subject of favorable cover stories in Newsweek and New York magazines, and the National Enquirer called it a "wonder drug." But there have been complaints, most notably in an article last February in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Author Martin Teicher, a research psychiatrist at Harvard University, discussed six patients who developed intense and violent thoughts of suicide while taking Prozac. The Church of Scientology, through its affiliate, the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, on Wednesday sent a letter to Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, calling for an investigation of Prozac and a recall of the drug. Scientology, whose members often wear shirts reading "Psychiatry Kills," has long campaigned against psychiatric drugs. A spokesman for Dingell said the committee is not investigating Prozac.
19890903000000000	NEW DRUG OFFERS HOPE FOR SOME SCHIZOPHRENICS. Frederick J. Benham Sr. had his first bout with mental illness in 1948, when he was on the cusp of adulthood and away from home in the Army. Something just snapped, and he found himself in a military hospital, undergoing hypnosis. "At that time there was no such thing as tranquilizers," the 58-year-old Bridgeport, Conn., man said of the array of anti-psychotic medications that later would help usher in a new era of treatment for schizophrenia. Benham has been on and off neuroleptics, as they are called, since 1960. Like others who have taken them, he is ambivalent about the drugs, which becalm hallucinations and clarify disordered thinking. "They gave me relief for symptoms I had," he said. "I would get over-excited . . . and they made me more controllable." But, "as for making me feel good, it was not as if I was on Cloud 9." In recent years neuroscientists have searched for an improvement on the old anti-schizophrenic medicines. One could be on the market within months, its manufacturer says. "Even though we welcomed" the older generation of drugs, "they've got limitations," said Dr. William M. Glazer, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven. The problems of classical anti-schizophrenic medications such as Thorazine, Mellaril and Haldol include their awful side effects: uncontrollable -- and often irreversible -- tics and twitches, motor disturbances and persistent states of restlessness. Another limitation is that they are not effective on as many patients as doctors would like, said Glazer, one of many scientists around the United States experimenting with new drugs that offer "a better profile." One of those drugs, clozapine, is likely to be on the market for some schizophrenics by the end of the year, said Dr. Gilbert Honigfeld, who has led clozapine research for Sandoz Pharmaceuticals since 1973. Clozapine is one of a new class of atypical neuroleptics that works differently in the brain and doesn't seem to cause the usual side effects. Also, studies show that clozapine more effectively reaches schizophrenics who for unknown reasons do not respond well to the older drugs. In addition to its anti-delusional activity, clozapine seems able to help break through the wall of isolation and withdrawal that often surrounds patients in a way that current medicines do not, said Dr. John W. Goethe, head of clinical research at the Institute of Living in Hartford. Although it avoids the worst side effects of the existing anti-psychotic drugs, clozapine does have some side effects. It causes 2% of the patients taking it to suffer a severe drop in white blood cells, Honigfeld said. Those cells are key to the immune system's ability to fight infection, and the condition can be life-threatening. As a result, if the Food and Drug Administration approves it for other than experimental use, clozapine will be restricted to the quarter-million or so schizophrenics who do not respond to the current drugs, Honigfeld said. One of the most debilitating and chronic, if least understood, diseases, schizophrenia exacts an enormous toll on the estimated 1 million Americans who have it, as well as on their loved ones. Some schizophrenics' "lack of insight," or failure to acknowledge their illness and the need for treatment, is a common obstacle to many patients' getting better and staying out of the hospital. But the effectiveness and side effects of the classical neuroleptics are issues that have plagued patients and doctors for years, Glazer said. Only about 15% of schizophrenics on the regimen of existing drugs show a complete response to the medication, Glazer said, while three-quarters show a partial response. Ten percent show no response. The side effect known as tardive dyskinesia strikes a third of all patients taking neuroleptics, said Glazer, who heads a Yale clinic that investigates the disorder. Some patients are hit severely, exhibiting movement disturbances that an onlooker might mistakenly conclude result from the mental disorder itself. These include bizarre motions of the mouth and tongue, lip-smacking, chewing and tics of the fingers and toes, Glazer said. Painful side effects include rigid, immobilized features. The eyes can become fixed, the jaw thrust open. Other patients experience a chronic restlessness and hyperexcitability that can be "very, very debilitating," he added. These side effects can have the paradoxical effect of stimulating the very delusions and hallucinations the drugs are meant to correct. Today's research aims at finding chemicals that minimize side effects, while more exquisitely fine-tuning the chemical reactions in the brain that have been linked to the onset of schizophrenia. After two decades of study, neuroscience still has only dimly illuminated those reactions, even in the normal brain. It took seven years after the discovery of Thorazine in 1952 for a Swedish scientist to determine that the drug worked by interfering with the passage within the brain of a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters responsible for the way information from our senses, our memories and our conscious and unconscious thoughts is relayed back and forth. In the normal brain, these neurotransmitters work dynamically with each other, allowing us to perceive the world and act in it in ways that are varied and idiosyncratic, to be sure, but also, by consensus, normal. In the schizophrenic brain, that delicate balance is upset by miniature deluges and droughts of dopamine, and, it is increasingly believed, other neurochemicals. Scientists are "hot on the trail of the mechanism underlying schizophrenia," Glazer said. Although "dopamine continues to be the leading candidate," its relationship to other neurotransmitters is a subject of intense inquiry. Clozapine research is focusing on the way the drug regulates the balance between dopamine and another neurotransmitter, serotonin, Glazer said. Research suggests that something about the drug's effect on dopamine and serotonin enables it to work in schizophrenics who have been unresponsive to the older drugs, he said. Brain biochemistry is showing that schizophrenia is less "a unitary disease than a spectrum of diseases," Goethe of the Institute of Living said. The treatment of schizophrenia has come a long way since the day Fred Benham entered Walter Reed Hospital at age 17. Before Thorazine, patients were strapped in "tranquilizer chairs," spun around until they were dizzy, restrained much of the time and given high doses of insulin designed to plunge them into insulin shock, a procedure then thought to be therapeutic, Glazer said. There is no question, he added, that the introduction of anti-psychotic drugs revolutionized the care of schizophrenia and paved the way for the movement that helps the mentally ill leave the hospital to start a new life back in the community. Nearly 40 years later, clozapine is "only tiding things over" until the next "designer drug" comes along, made safer and more effective by "bending atoms, adding a little carbon here, a hydrogen there," Glazer said. But, he said, he finds the prospects of a new generation of atypical neuroleptics exciting, capable of producing major changes in the delivery of mental health care.
19891004000000000	SCHIZOPHRENIA DRUG APPROVED WITH TEST PLAN. The federal government on Tuesday approved a new drug to treat severe schizophrenia and a monitoring program in which patients using the drug will be tested weekly for signs of a potentially fatal side effect. The Food and Drug Administration said the drug, clozapine, can be used only for patients who have not responded to at least two regimens of standard, less toxic therapy. An estimated 200,000 people could benefit, the FDA said. The drug has been shown to relieve symptoms of severe schizophrenia, allowing patients to lead more productive lives. But it also can cause a potentially fatal blood disorder in which the level of white blood cells is reduced. Studies have shown the condition can be reversed if caught early. The drug also is associated with seizures, officials said. Under the monitoring system, a home health care company will distribute the prescribed medication to patients each week and collect blood samples that will be sent to a national laboratory for analysis, the FDA said. If the test results indicate that the patient must stop taking the drug, the patient's doctor will be notified.
19901111000000000	BABY BLUES; POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION TRIGGERED MOTHER'S DESCENT INTO SUICIDE. Late on a Friday afternoon in September, Victoria Karter walked into the Four Seasons Hotel, declined the offer of a fourth-floor room and took one instead on the 19th floor. A tall, dark-haired woman with an angular face, Karter, 33, carried a garment bag as well as a purse. She stayed in the room only about one hour, but it was long enough to leave cigarettes snuffed out in ashtrays and to put a ring of lipstick around the neck of the Jack Daniels liquor bottle she brought with her. Long enough, too, to make a final telephone call. The call was intended for Kathy Boone, a woman who had been Karter's friend for more than 20 years. But because Boone wasn't there, Karter talked to Virginia Rivera, Boone's mother and a woman who considered Karter a member of her own family. Karter told Rivera what she had been telling Boone since soon after the birth of her first child 4 1/2 months earlier: She wanted to commit suicide. "She told me that she wanted to talk to Kathy and she needed to tell her a few things before she would kill herself," Rivera said. "I said, 'Vicky, give me your number and I'll have Kathy call you. She should be here any moment.' " But Karter refused to say where she was. "She said, 'Mrs. Rivera, I'm so sick, I feel so sick.' At that moment it seemed like she dropped the phone. I kept calling her. I could hear noises. I thought maybe someone was there with her. I stayed on the phone the longest time. Then all of a sudden I didn't hear anything." Karter walked out on the balcony of room 1902 and jumped to her death. Gregory Owen Lee sits in the living room of his comfortable Newport Beach home, bouncing his daughter, Rachel, on his knee and then putting a bottle in her mouth. Periodically, he stops talking to fight back tears. A dark-haired, bespectacled businessman who chooses his words carefully, Lee says that both he and Karter had wanted children. "My personal point of view is . . . that's what life is all about, to have a family and raise kids." Lee, 35, thinks of himself as an "old-fashioned kind of guy" who wanted to marry just once, "settle down and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, happily ever after in my case was three years." In six months he has gone from being the husband of a pregnant wife to being a widower left to raise an infant daughter on his own. He tries to juggle his work schedule to spend as much time as possible with his child. He hopes he doesn't hear an old favorite song on the radio to make him burst into tears. "I know that despite the adversity that I'm facing right now, my primary focus has to be toward my baby," Lee says. "I'm sitting here right now and you see me and I'm pretty composed and I can talk to you about the incident. Two weeks ago if you had seen me I would be crying and . . . distraught about not knowing what's going to happen." Baby books and toys dot the house. There is other literature, too, explaining a condition Lee said he never heard of before Rachel's birth: postpartum depression. It's believed that postpartum depression caused Karter's suicide, an illness Lee said he heard about for the first time when his wife was hospitalized at UCI Medical Center. That was almost three months after Rachel's birth in late April, a typically happy, blessed event for most women, but one that plunged Karter into despair. Doctors say that while most mothers get the "baby blues" after giving birth, the condition lasts only a little while. Postpartum depression, by contrast, strikes about 10% of new mothers and does not "cure itself." The illness has been known for centuries, but only in the past 10 to 15 years has it been studied in depth. Medical opinion is divided on whether the depression stems from a chemical imbalance after childbirth or if it is caused largely by existing emotional problems, troubles that Karter never seemed to have before giving birth. Psychiatrists say only a tiny minority of those who develop a full-fledged postpartum depression kill themselves or their children. One doctor calls the number "small" but "significant." Kathy Boone and Vicky Karter met when they were 11 years old, in 1968, in junior high school. Boone said her friend was happy and outgoing, an artist talented at drawing, a poet, a journalism student and "very creative." Boone's mother, Virginia Rivera, called Karter "an average, normal girl." She was at the Rivera house in Montebello so often as a child that Rivera "felt like she was our stepdaughter or adopted daughter." The death of her mother a year or so after Karter graduated from high school struck her hard, Rivera said. "It bothered her a lot that she didn't have her mother there for her. I told her whenever she needed someone, just call me, and she always did." Over the years, even after Karter went off to college at Cal State Long Beach and Boone got married not long after high school, the friends stayed together. Karter would bring boyfriends by to meet Boone's mother, but she kept waiting to meet the right one to marry. Karter and Lee met in 1985 at a dance at a temple in Beverly Hills. After dating for two years, they married in Las Vegas on her 30th birthday, the first marriage for each. They held a party later for friends at the Newport Beach house that had been his and became theirs. She worked in the family office supply store in East Los Angeles. He worked at the office machine distribution company he had founded after graduating from USC in 1980. If there was one smudge on the picture, it was Karter's frequent concern with what other people thought, and her tendency to make mountains out of molehills. "Vicky was the kind of person that would make everything into a major problem," Boone said. "When she was thinking of marrying Greg, she would wonder: Should she do it? Shouldn't she do it? . . . What if it didn't work out? What if she got divorced?" But the marriage was a happy one, Lee said. "I won't say we agreed on everything 100%, but we never had fights, yelling fights or anything like that. . . . We got along exceptionally well." And a little more than two years after their marriage, Karter became pregnant. "She seemed the happiest I've ever seen her," Boone remembered. But after Rachel's birth, Karter's attitude changed. "I went with my kids to the hospital with balloons," Boone said. Karter "didn't seem like someone who had a baby. It didn't seem like a joyous thing to her." One day about a month after the birth, a "hysterical" Karter called Boone. "She said she didn't know what to do. The baby cried a lot, had colic. Vicky wasn't prepared, I guess, for that. She was stuck in the house. She didn't know what to do." Lee said the newborn baby was in intensive care for three days for treatment of jaundice. When mother and daughter came home, Rachel cried seemingly around the clock for nearly three months, he said. But while his wife wasn't getting much sleep at all, he didn't see any "abnormal-type problems." That changed in mid-July. First came a call from Karter's sister, Lee said, telling him that "she was very concerned for Vicky's safety and Vicky had expressed some thoughts of suicide to her." The next day came a call from Boone, saying she, too, was worried about Vicky. An alarmed Lee took Karter to UCI Medical Center, where she was hospitalized until the end of the month. Lee said doctors there diagnosed her as suffering from postpartum depression and prescribed the antidepressant drug Pamelor, the trade name for a generic drug known as nortriptyline. (A medical center spokeswoman said that because of state and federal laws to protect the privacy of psychiatric patients, the hospital could not even confirm she had been a patient there, let alone discuss her case.) When she came home from the hospital, Karter got help with Rachel from a newly hired nanny/housekeeper. Lee, who attended Lamaze classes with his wife during her pregnancy and was in the delivery room during birth, said he also tried to help out more with the baby. After about two weeks at home, with lots of rest, the medication took full effect, and "I was utterly amazed," Lee said. Normally an even-tempered person, after Rachel's birth Karter had swung into deep depression. But now "she was uncharacteristically too enthusiastic. . . . All of a sudden she's the most enthusiastic, energetic person I've ever met. And I'm thinking to myself, 'Wow, these drugs are working great. This is fantastic. It's a miracle." Boone saw the change too. One day Karter telephoned her "and said she felt great . . . just felt wonderful. She had told me before that she felt she was walking around in a cloud, a fog, that she couldn't function. Then this one day she was wonderful, her head was clear, and for about three weeks she was like that, everything was fine." But Karter became depressed again. Lee said his wife told him she didn't understand what was happening, that she would go to the mall, see other women smiling happily as they pushed their babies in strollers. "And here I am, I've got a nice home and a nice husband and a nice baby, and yet I'm feeling weird," Lee remembered his wife saying. "And dumb me, I'm saying, 'Ah, things will pass, you're just getting back (to normal). Did you take your medicine?' " Boone said Karter told her that the doctors rejected her request to stop taking Pamelor when she was feeling better, but agreed to lower the dose. Later the dose was increased again, but it didn't seem to help. (The doctor at the Santa Ana psychiatric offices of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who Lee said treated his wife after she was discharged from the hospital, declined comment and referred inquiries to the facility's administrator, who did not return phone calls). Karter told Boone in one of the telephone conversations they had nearly every day that she just couldn't function. "She kept telling me she was a bad person and everyone would be better off without her," Boone recalled. Karter said that after she died her husband eventually "would find somebody else and that person would take care of the baby." Still concerned with others' opinions of her, Karter rejected Boone's advice to get away for a few days. She said she was afraid to leave the baby at home for fear people would think she wasn't a good mother. She was afraid to admit her thoughts of suicide to her doctors for fear she would be institutionalized for the rest of her life, which would bankrupt her husband. On Sept. 19, a Wednesday, a woman who declined to give her name showed up at Newport Beach police headquarters at 8 p.m. with a disturbing tale. The woman said she had been at Cliff Drive Park in the Newport Heights section of Newport Beach a little bit earlier. While there she saw a woman with an infant. The woman seemed "despondent." The good Samaritan walked the woman to her car, copied her license plate number and alerted police to her concern. Police traced the number to Karter and visited her and Lee at their home. After interviewing the husband and wife separately and together, police concluded Karter was no danger to herself or anyone else just then, had resources she could turn to if she needed help, and left. Two days later, Karter told her housekeeper she was going out for a while. At 1 p.m., she made a reservation for a room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. She showed up at 3:30 p.m. to check in. One hotel employee called her "pleasant." Another described her as "distant." A bit after 4 p.m., Karter called Rivera to ask if Boone was there. Rivera said no, that her daughter was probably either still at her home in Cerritos or on the way to the Rivera house in Montebello. Karter said she'd try the Cerritos number. Around 4:30, Karter called Rivera again, saying she hadn't been able to reach Boone. "I told her to leave her number where she was and I'd have Kathy call her," Rivera remembered. "She said she was going to kill herself. She said she didn't want anyone to know where she was -- she didn't want anyone to stop her." Minutes after she heard the phone drop and her pleas to Karter go unanswered, Rivera's daughter arrived. Boone called Karter's housekeeper. She called Lee at one of his company's offices, in Moreno Valley. She called the Newport Beach police. Lee began frantically calling the Newport Beach police himself. He also called the Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol. Then he drove home, where he made more phone calls. And waited. He called the Newport Beach police again, but found the dispatcher "evasive." He called the Costa Mesa police to see if they knew anything about his wife. He called Newport Beach again, talking to a dispatcher who Lee said promised "to have detectives talk to me." "Not knowing is worse than knowing," Lee said, and for more than three hours he didn't know. At around 8:30 that night, though, two detectives and a deputy coroner showed up at his house "and said they had information about my wife." He knew.
19901112000000000	PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: SOME MEDICINES CAN INDUCE DISTRESSING SWINGS IN MOOD. The woman thought she was going crazy. Hallucinations, severe insomnia and extreme restlessness that would not let her sit still for a minute sent her to a psychiatrist. He recognized a toxic reaction to the medicine her family physician had prescribed for heartburn. Once she stopped taking the drug, she returned to normal. A surprising number of medications can produce symptoms that mimic mental illness. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, panic and even hallucinations can be brought on by certain prescription or over-the-counter medications. Prozac (fluoxetine) is one of the most controversial medicines in the pharmacy. It has been heralded as a breakthrough against psychological depression and has undoubtedly saved many lives. But some people experience serious psychological side effects. We have heard from some people who suffered depression while on Inderal (propranolol) for their heart, and didn't realize that their black mood was caused by the drug until their doctors changed the prescription for some other reason. Others have experienced much the same reactions from beta blocker eye drops prescribed for glaucoma. Alarming reactions sometimes occur with apparently innocuous medicines. A reader using a Transderm Scop patch for motion sickness caused by deep sea fishing found that she became extremely tired and incoherent. Sometimes stopping a medicine can cause a psychiatric reaction. One woman was prescribed Xanax (alprazolam) because of anxiety associated with heart surgery. When her cardiologist eventually told her to quit the medicine, she went through hell. Anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, muscle twitching and disorientation were intolerable. Suddenly stopping benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Halcion (triazolam) or Valium (diazepam) after long-term use can produce serious symptoms that may make a person question his sanity. To avoid difficulties, gradual withdrawal is advised. We have prepared a special brochure for readers of this column describing medications that have psychiatric side effects.

19891204000000000	AMERICAN ALBUM: BUSINESS IS BUBBLING AGAIN AS LITHIUM-WATER DRINKERS SWEAR BY ITS HEALING POWERS.. People are once again bringing their hopes, dreams and illnesses to this little community, seeking fulfillment and cure in the spring water that long ago was medicine and thirst-quencher for Cherokees. The water, laden with minerals and generations of lore, reputedly can treat manic-depression, alcoholism, heart trouble and kidney problems. It also has been hailed as an aphrodisiac, leading to its nickname of "love water." Such claims helped overcome a slightly alkaline taste and created a boom in bottled lithium water over a century ago. The only lithium springs in the United States spawned a resort, including a golf course and the sumptuous Sweetwater Park Hotel, that drew the rich and ill in droves. Hard times soon hit. The hotel burned down in 1912. The federal Food and Drug Administration banned the extravagant advertising claims. Public enthusiasm for lithia water began to wane, and by the 1940s bottling ceased. But business is bubbling again here. In 1983, history aficionado Gleda James, along with other investors, bought the springs and resumed bottling. Mineral water sales -- now the fastest growing segment in the beverage industry -- were taking off and the Lithia Springs Water Co., benefiting from the legacy of those legendary claims, took off even faster. The company will double its sales to over a million gallons this year. Recently, James received a purchase order from the Philippines. And a Tokyo department store is displaying the water. Closer to home, the water company provides its product, gratis, to the Georgia Legislature, thus putting claims of the water's soothing powers to a severe test. The springs now are part of a rustic complex on a 5-acre plot about 20 miles west of Atlanta that also contains a small museum detailing the water's history, a little herb garden and a huge rock formation with Indian carvings. James and her partners also hope to restore the resort. Tourists and locals alike make their way here -- sometimes to buy the water as part of their effort to cure illnesses doctors are having little success treating, and sometimes to simply reassure themselves that the springs, like their memories, still exist. Martha Fain, visiting here recently from nearby Powder Springs, Ga., sipped some of the water and said: "It tastes like I remember it tasting as a child." The water, which flows through a rock formation into a 40-foot-deep basin, contains potassium, calcium, magnesium and manganese. But its distinctive ingredient is lithium, a light metal. In Sacramento, Gen Baugher said the lithium water has improved her kidney function and helped relieve her son's manic-depression. The water is not sold in California stores, but for years she has had the water shipped by the truckload, adding: "It's very valuable to us." Physicians used to hail lithium water as a healer's delight. A Congress of Physicians at Lithia Springs in 1887 produced a report recommending the water to treat, among other conditions, kidney stones, jaundice, rheumatism, headaches, typhoid fever, indigestion, eczema, dropsy and "diseases of delicate women." Doctors today are likely to recommend it only if you are thirsty. But lithium pills are prescribed for depression, and it follows, say some lithium-water drinkers, that the water must have some of the same properties. James and her son Greg, who helps operate the bottling company, are careful not to make claims about the water curing illnesses or putting fizz into one's sex life. However, they do relate stories that have been told to them by customers like Baugher. James recalled one man who "gets five gallons of water at a time. When he bought the first bottles, he said he had heard it was good for the prostate and for impotency. He said he was going to give it the acid test. He's been coming back for five years now." Jared Huburt Irwin, a 74-year-old resident of Douglasville, Ga., first drank lithium water as a young Army mule driver back in 1934 because it "cooled your thirst and gave me energy. While the other boys were drinking whiskey, I drank the water." Now ill with diabetes and bed-ridden after having a leg amputated, Irwin had been unable to get any of the water for a while. The other day, friends supplied him with some, considerably brightening his outlook. "I'm hoping it'll make me better," he told a visitor. "I think it will." Not everyone takes to the water so hopefully. Yvette Alexander said it reminded her of water with baking soda in it. But she smiled when she was reminded of the water's reputed aphrodisiac qualities. Preparing to drive with her friend Zack Nauth from Atlanta to Baton Rouge, La., Alexander said: "I'll let you know what Zack does on the way home."
19901208000000000	BOYFRIEND, 22, TELLS COURT HE STRANGLED WESTLAKE WOMAN. A 22-year-old murder suspect charged with the slaying of his Westlake girlfriend slumped at the witness stand Friday in Ventura County Superior Court, slapped the microphone down and confessed that he killed her. Timothy Velasco testified that he killed Ellen Cleary, 37, of Westlake. But Velasco said he wanted to keep secret a confession he made to police the day of the slaying because he wanted to spare her family the details of her sex life, her substance abuse and her death. "What I did, I did, and I did it," Velasco said after taking the witness stand during a hearing that had been called to determine whether to keep earlier grand jury testimony sealed and whether to allow an earlier confession into evidence at trial. Velasco, of Van Nuys, slit Cleary's throat with a steak knife, strangled her, then knotted plastic bags over her head to asphyxiate her in her residence on Oct. 4, according to the grand jury records which were ordered unsealed Friday by Judge Steven Z. Perren. Velasco told investigators he killed Cleary because "he felt that she was tragic, her life was tragic, and he wished to send her to heaven," Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol J. Nelson said Friday in an interview. Velasco testified that he thought the Oct. 4 interview with police would be confidential and would not have talked to them in such detail had he known he was being videotaped. "It was really nobody's business except Ellen's business," Velasco testified. "I felt like I was talking behind her back, bad about her." Deputy Public Defender William McGuffey argued that the Oct. 4 confession in a sheriff's interview room violated Velasco's rights against self-incrimination because he did not know detectives were videotaping it. But Detective Sgt. Thomas Odle testified that he read Velasco his rights several times, although he did not tell him the video camera in the room was running during the confession. Perren refused to throw out the confession and unsealed the grand jury transcript, which outlines the grim scene detectives found in Cleary's condominium a few hours after Velasco turned himself in. Detective Richard Gatling told the grand jury that the living room floor was spattered with blood. A clean steak knife was found sticking in the living room wall, and an identical, bloodied knife was found in the bathroom next to the tub, according to the grand jury transcript. Cleary's nude body floated in the tub, her head almost completely submerged and covered with three white plastic bags, which were secured by two more bags knotted around her neck, Gatling told the grand jury. Velasco told investigators he went to Cleary's house that morning and found her engaged in a sexual act with Dr. Donald Alan Lee, a Simi Valley cardiologist, Nelson said in a court document. Velasco had just found a job with a small courier service and wanted to share the good news with Cleary, his lover of several years, who was unemployed and living on a trust fund, Nelson said. Velasco told investigators that Cleary was an alcoholic and had been taking lithium carbonate pills which Lee supplied to her, Nelson said. Lithium carbonate is a chemical used to moderate mood swings in manic-depressive people, although Cleary was not manic-depressive, Nelson said. Lee said in a brief telephone interview Friday, "I don't talk about Mrs. Cleary right now. Sorry. Bye-bye," and hung up. Nelson said she does not know if she will investigate Velasco's allegations. In recounting the events leading to the fatal stabbing, according to Nelson, Velasco told investigators that Lee had quietly left Cleary's condominium after Velasco arrived. Velasco said that he and Cleary ate the lunch of salmon with green peppercorns which she had planned to eat with the doctor, and then had sex, according to the grand jury transcript. Velasco told investigators that as Cleary lay nude and face-down on the floor afterward, he came up behind her with a steak knife and cut her throat, trying to find her jugular vein. Nelson said in her closing statement to the grand jury that Velasco then "manually strangled her, in his words, 'forever,' " and tied the plastic bags over her head to ensure her death. Velasco then called a friend at Independence High School in Van Nuys, drove to meet her in the school and told her he had killed Cleary, the transcript said. School officials summoned police and took Velasco into custody. Velasco is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. A hearing for pretrial motions is scheduled for March 15, 1991.
19901227000000000	PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NO MIRACLE DRUG, BUT CLOZARIL MAY HELP SCHIZOPHRENIC SON. Question: My 23-year-old son suffers from schizophrenia. After living on the streets like a bum, he finally agreed to move into a residential treatment center. They have him on Haldol, but he is often restless and confused and frequently complains of blurred vision. We've read about a new medication for schizophrenia called Clozaril. It's very expensive, but we would be willing to make the sacrifice if it were a breakthrough against this awful disease. Is this drug worth the price? Answer: Clozaril (clozapine) has been available in Europe for almost 20 years but has recently been approved in the United States. It is unlikely to cause the uncontrollable muscle twitching (tardive dyskinesia) often brought on by traditional schizophrenia medications. This new drug is no miracle breakthrough. It can help some schizophrenics who have not responded well to other medicine, but it may cause drowsiness, drooling, constipation, blood pressure problems or seizures. Of far greater concern is a potentially life-threatening blood disorder that occurs in one or two patients out of 100. For this reason the company requires weekly blood tests, and the combination of medicine and monitoring can bring the price to almost $9,000 per year. The price may drop if a new testing program is developed. This may make the medicine affordable, but your son's doctor is the best judge of whether he could benefit from Clozaril. Q. I read your article on bedwetting and a medicine that has been developed for children. I myself am a bedwetter of 33 years. This has caused me to shy away from sleeping over, having others to sleep over, or enjoying any kind of intimate relationship. I am afraid to go to a doctor with this problem because of shame. Is there any hope at all for an old lady like me? A. You bet, but you need to screw up your courage and see a physician. We promise that a urologist will not be surprised to hear about your problem and will treat you with sensitivity. The doctor will determine the cause of your difficulty. Minor surgery may be the best approach, or the new drug you read about might turn your life around. DDAVP (desmopressin) works for adults as well as children. The nasal spray can effectively control nighttime urine production.
