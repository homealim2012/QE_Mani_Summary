19920320000000000	FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology: Tamarins return to the jungle - A Brazilian experiment to save an endangered species from extinction. In a lush patch of Brazilian rainforest a group of golden lion tamarins discover the joys of swinging between trees. Brought up in the Los Angeles zoo and recently introduced to the wild, they form part of one of the world's most successful experiments in saving a species from extinction. The project brings together first and third world nations, private and public sectors, environmentalists and farmers, as well as several scientific disciplines. Its techniques are now being copied worldwide. Only 450 of the monkeys survive in the wild. Throughout this century many have been captured to keep as domestic pets by people attracted by their exotic beauty and flaming golden fur. Moreover, their natural habitat has almost disappeared. The animal has been rescued through the combined forces of Aldemar Coimbra, Brazil's first primate specialist, and Devra Kleiman, a director of the National Zoo in Washington. Coimbra realised the danger in the 1960s when there were around 600 left. He was unable to raise much interest until 1972 when Kleiman held a conference in Washington on Saving the Golden Lion Tamarin. Experts from Europe and the US discussed how tamarins could be reproduced in captivity and then reintroduced to their native habitat. Breeding tamarins in zoos proved so successful that there are now more in captivity than in the wild. 'When I started there were just 72 animals in 16 zoos. Now we have more than 550 in 130 zoos and a third of them are on contraceptives because they are growing so quickly that we cannot find zoos for them,' says Kleiman. In 1983 the team of Brazilian and American scientists began the more difficult process of reintroducing those born in captivity into the Atlantic rainforest in the Poco das Antas biological reserve south of Rio. So far 69 have been reintroduced with a 70 per cent survival rate and a further 60 are to be reintroduced this year. Denise Rambaldi, who heads the field programme, says that the animals generally adapt quickly. 'Initially they do not know how to defend themselves against predators and they fall over a lot because they're used to stronger branches in their cages. But after the third tumble they usually learn.' According to Rambaldi, the main indicator of the project's success is the ability of the reintroduced animals to breed among themselves and with their wild cousins. Of 33 surviving offspring at least 10 are the result of crossing wild and reintroduced tamarins, adding variety to the gene pool. Family histories are kept on all former captive and wild tamarins to avoid inbreeding. 'There is no doubt that the ability of once-captive tamarins to bear offspring sometimes by mating with wild tamarins and their gradual ability to feed themselves in the wild proves that reintroducing them into their old habitat has been a success,' says Coimbra. The project is special for several reasons, says Kleiman. Reintroducing captive-born animals is a pioneering method of preserving species, and the preservation of tropical forests is a developing science. It brings together 130 zoos, IBAMA (the Brazilian state environment agency), the World Wildlife Fund and the Rio Primate Centre. The success of the project is far from guaranteed. 'We're fighting against time. In less than 20 years tamarins could be extinct in Brazil and thus worldwide', warns Coimbra. The main problem is lack of forested land. The reserve is only 5,500 hectares, of which 60 per cent is covered by forest. Each group of five or six monkeys requires 40 hectares of forest and Kleiman estimates that 20,000 hectares are needed to keep the 2,000 tamarins necessary for the breed's sustainable survival. 'The larger aim of the project is to regenerate the Atlantic forest for tamarins and other endangered species,' she adds. Consequently, the project's organisers are trying to involve private business, aiming to raise Dollars 250,000 a year to buy remaining forestland. So far they have persuaded 11 farmers to dedicate their remaining forest to protection for the monkeys. Another problem is a wave of tamarin robberies to sell on Brazil's black market. At least 10 have been stolen in the last year and a publicity programme has been launched to raise local consciousness. 'When we have the international community supporting the feeding and maintenance of these animals outside Brazil, sending them to Brazil and then hearing they have been stolen it does not look good for Brazil,' warns Kleiman. One answer has been to hand every tamarin back in a special ceremony to the Brazilian government to create more local responsibility. But Mr Jairo Costa, President of the Brazilian Foundation for Conservation which helps fund the project, believes a tougher crackdown on the trade is necessary. 'Catching an animal is regarded as a source of wealth. It is hard to persuade someone with hunger in his stomach that for the sake of ecology he should remain hungry.'
19920314000000000	FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: An island haven for noisy wildlife - Michael Woods visits a part of Australia where the sea-lions have priority over people. THE LARGE buff-maned bull sea-lion reared up and surveyed the beach around him. A second bull, silvery grey and sleekly wet, fresh from the sea, was suddenly faced with his noisy aggression. Backing off quickly, he skirted the first animal,which was nearly 8 ft long and built like a tank, and found a more peaceful spot to sleep. Fortunately my presence only four yards away was disdainfully ignored for, on Seal Beach, the sea-lions have become accustomed to having priority over the 70,000 visitors who come each year to see them. Probably 10 per cent of the total Australian sea-lion population lives and breeds on this beach on Kangaroo Island, and to watch them swimming, resting and suckling their young is a privilege: there are few places in the world where such animals are so tolerant. Almost 30 per cent of Kangaroo Island, Australia's third largest, has been set aside for conservation, and it is a wonderful place to see many of the country's indigenous species. When, earlier this century, South Australia realised that modification of much of the state's natural habitat was wiping out its wildlife, it introduced a number of animals, such as koala and platypus to Kangaroo Island in order to conserve them. For my part, a visit to this temperate wildlife haven was pure indulgence. On Seal Beach, for instance, we did not just watch sea-lions but saw the complete skeleton of a whale washed up about five years ago, and glimpsed a pair of white-breasted sea eagles. The biggest national park on the island, Flinders Chase, occupies the western end and covers an area of 185,000 acres. Koalas sit wedged in the crotches of gum branches, sleeping soundly in the leafy shade. The more wakeful scratch lazily or extend a paw for the occasional leaf. Unlike the mainland population, these animals are disease-free. Without predators, their numbers are booming. At the information centre, Kangaroo Island's own kangaroos gather to be fed by visitors. They take pellets with salivary muzzles and demonstrate how, when moving slowly, they support their bodies on their tails and front limbs in order to move their hind legs forward. Here, near the rangers' offices at Rocky River, our guide, Craig Wickham, grilled steaks on a barbecue in one of several special covered areas provided by the park authorities. These are spacious, clean, open-sided buildings with tables and benches, running water and a sizeable gas grill. It is a testament to the general atmosphere of trust and honesty on the island that the original gas lighter, provided when the barbecue was installed some years ago, is still there. We drove south through dense forest to the tall stone lighthouse at Cape du Couedic, first to see Admiral's Arch, which drips with long black knobbly stalactites. The Southern ocean beats against the cliffs here and against the small off-shore islands where sea-lions and New Zealand fur seals bask on the rocks. Nearby, in a sudden geological switch from limestone to granite, is a dome topped with a collection of naturally sculpted and scalloped boulders. Their forms and the play of light and shade present great opportunities for photographers but how, in this hard rock, some of the boulders achieved their massive, spectacularly delicate shapes, puzzles me still. In comparison with the huge bulk of Australia, Kangaroo Island looks tiny, a day-trip's worth of island a stone's throw from the South Australia coast. In fact, at 90 miles long and 35 wide it is almost 12 times the size of the Isle of Wight and a single day is adequate only for skimming its surface. Even with Craig, who was born on the island and knows it intimately, I did not see all I wanted in two days and could easily have spent twice that time there. Kangaroo Island's mainly dirt roads, although often badly corrugated, are pleasant to travel on: a broad strip of trees and shrubs flanks each roadside between fields and carriageway and gives a wilder, wooded feel. At the same time the climate is cool and comfortable even in high summer. While large waves frequently batter the south coast, the sun-facing north is much more sheltered with the Australian mainland only a short distance away across Investigator strait. Here we visited Stokes Bay, a delightful hidden treasure reached through a natural tunnel in the rocks where fairy penguins nest. The brilliant white sands of the beach are protected by a reef of rocks which provides safe swimming. Not all the interesting parts of Kangaroo Island are found around its coast. For example, a number of inland lagoons support a wealth of water birds. Some are little known, and Craig drove me across fields to reach them - irregular shady pools with gums standing in their midst up to their knees in water. One lagoon was good for spoonbills, another was used by chestnut teal and wood duck as well as more familiar birds like little grebes and moorhens. It is always a pleasure to be guided by someone who has a good knowledge of an area and its wildlife and so, when I asked to be shown kookaburras, Craig offered koalas, too, and took me to a small wood on the way to the airport. We spotted the birds at once but the koalas were more elusive. Craig was determined, though, and - just as it began to look as if I would have to dash to catch my aircraft - we caught sight of one almost concealed in a thicket of gum leaves. Michael Woods toured Kangaroo island with Craig Wickham's Adventure Charters (tel: 0848-33282) which is based at the Wanderer's Rest in American River (tel: 0848-33140), a pleasant motel with striking views over Eastern cove, where he stayed. He flew to Kangaroo Island from Adelaide with Air Kangaroo Island (tel: 08-2344177). Visitors to Kangaroo Island will probably want to stay overnight in Adelaide at the start and end of their visit. Adelaide's Bed and Breakfast at 239 Franklin Street (tel: 08-2313124) is cool, comfortable and friendly and the proprietors, Tony and Deirdre DiFalco, serve good food with style.
19920229000000000	FT  29 FEB 92 / Elephants in their sights: The arguments for lifting the ivory trade ban. A Zimbabwean villager had a blunt riposte to the world's 'elefriends' gathering in Kyoto this weekend, intent on maintaining a ban on ivory trade: 'Elephants eat people's food, and people are dying of hunger.' The question of whether to lift the ban will be among the most controversial issues this week at the triennial meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). As a test case for the effectiveness of trade measures in achieving environmental ends, it will provide important signals for action in defence of endangered animal and plant species. Although elephant populations have recovered in some areas, such as Zimbabwe, since the imposition of a ban on ivory trade in 1989, the species remains in danger. There is a heated debate over the extent to which the ban on trade has been responsible for the slim, localised recovery and whether extending the life of ban will sustain or undermine the future of the elephant. The danger facing the elephant is not in dispute. Africa's elephant population slumped from 1.2m to 600,000 between 1980 and 1988. Total trade in unworked ivory rose from about 200 tonnes a year in 1950 to about 1,000 tonnes a year in 1980, and remained at this level throughout the 1980s. The total of ivory exported between 1979 and 1988 accounted for more than 700,000 elephants. Since the imposition of the trade ban at the last Cites meeting in 1989, there has been progress. Demand in Europe and the US for ivory has virtually disappeared, according to customs statistics. Poaching has not been eradicated, but in certain countries (notably in southern Africa) success has been such that elephant herds now need to be culled. But can the trade ban be credited for these successes? And can they be maintained? Evidence derived from the ivory trade debate suggests that the ban is valuable as a source of publicity and has helped to reduce consumer demand for ivory products. As long as legal ivory cannot be distinguished from illegal ivory, a total ban also simplifies the international policing effort. But there are also concerns among conservation groups that success is only partly due to the ban and that illegal trade channels may expand and reverse the progress which has been achieved. Even the Worldwide Fund for Nature, a committed campaigner for maintaining the ban, concedes in a report published this month: 'These dramatic drops (in poaching) were brought about through increased law enforcement efforts.' African governments which are calling for a lifting of the ban base their case on the need to strike a balance between their rural communities and the local elephant population. The concern underpinning Zimbabwe's call for a resumption in trade is that the rising number of elephants, with their voracious appetites, are threatening the livelihood of the agricultural community. While they have no economic value, there is no incentive for villagers to tolerate them. The Zimbabwean government insists, therefore, that a controlled resumption of trading in ivory would provide villagers with an incentive to tolerate and protect local elephant populations. An alternative strategy is to promote Safari tourism. According to research by Dr Edward Barbier at the London Environmental Economics Centre, the annual value of ivory exports from Africa amounted to between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m in the 1980s: 'Other values of the elephant, such as its importance to tourism earnings, may be considerably more significant,' he says. In a recent study of the economic value of elephants, colleagues at the Centre pointed out that in Kenya, earnings from viewing elephants came to about Dollars 25m a year - about 10 times the estimated value of poached ivory exports from Kenya. But despite the array of arguments mustered in favour of lifting the ban, such a policy poses clear dangers. Resumed trading would provide an avenue for poachers in countries where elephants remain under threat to 'launder' illegal ivory by mixing it with ivory from legal culls. Tests can now identify the DNA characteristics of individual pieces of ivory. It is therefore technically possible to identify poached ivory. Just how simply or effectively such tests could be administered is another matter. It is clear that no retail purchaser of ivory could tell the difference on a shop shelf, so oversight would need to be effective at source. Environmentalist groups, such as the Environmental Investigation Agency also emphasise the practical difficulties of monitoring the ivory at its source. They argue that corruption in large parts of Africa, and military conflict in Mozambique and elsewhere, as reasons for doubting whether DNA testing could be effective in preventing poached ivory from reaching world markets. Thousands of miles from the arguments in Kyoto, the elephant is unable to rest easily. Its security will not be guaranteed until demand in end-user countries has been staunched; until village communities in Africa can see some economic benefit from preserving this immensely disruptive pachyderm; and until the corruption and conflict on which poaching thrives have been brought under control.
19920922000000000	FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (11): Beautiful, multi-faceted jewel - The country's 450 cayes are a paradise for scuba divers. CONSERVATION and tourism have become almost synonymous in Belize. Mr Glenn Godfrey, minister of tourism, calls the country a beautiful, multi-faceted jewel. It boasts the longest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, and has 450 beautiful cayes which are a paradise for snorkellers and scuba divers. It also has some of the best preserved rain forests in the world in spite of extensive logging, as well as the beautiful Mayan mountains and their archaeological remains. Government tourism policy does not aim at large-scale ritzy developments such as Mexico's Cancun and Ixtapa but smaller-scale projects, where possible under Belizean ownership and retaining maximum added value for the country while respecting its traditional, eccentric social fabric. The commitment to conservation has developed in a fairly haphazard, incoherent way. Foreign institutions have played a significant role - most notably the World Life Conservation International, an offshoot of the New York Zoological Society. Nationally, the driving force has been the Belize Audebon Society. US conservationists are concerned about birds which emigrate north. Experts believe Belize may have as many as 500 species, many of which are endangered. Individuals have also played a big part in conservation projects. Alan Rabinovitch's fanatical and hair-raising research on jaguars and determined lobbying led to the establishment of the Cockscomb basin wildlife reserve where up to 100 are believed to survive. Another notable contributor has been Dr Robert Horwich who helped establish the somewhat inaptly named Community Baboon Sanctuary devoted to the threatened Black Howler monkey. He has also assisted in resettling the primates at Cockscomb where they were wiped out by yellow fever and Hurricane Hattie. The Programme for Belize, funded with foreign donations, now has 200,000 acres under management in the Rio Bravo area. Coca Cola Foods donated 92,000 acres having purchased the land from Mr Barry Bowen, a leading entrepreneur. The company renounced plans to plant citrus there after German conservationists objected. In turn, Mr Bowen, has cleared only 2,200 acres of his magnificent jungle territory, leaving another 130,000 virgin for the cause and adjoining the Rio Bravo estate. At the last official count Belize had 33 reserves under varying degrees of protection and management totalling 2.2m acres or about a quarter of the country's territory. 'Everyone has been encouraged by the reaction of the public,' says Mrs Janet Gibson, who is assisting the fisheries department in drawing up the coastal zone management plan. Developments on the coastal strip are threatening a vital eco-system including the mangroves with their capacity to contribute to fisheries. They cover an estimated 80 per cent of the shoreline. The fate of the manatee, or sea cow, and other marine creatures, are also at stake. Ambergris is the main tourist centre but it is overpriced and has serious water and sewage problems. A plan to increase its potential is about to be submitted to the cabinet. Belize's small population is probably the main reason why it remains an environmental paradise. However, this could be threatened by demographic changes, which may result from the arrival of some 40,000 Guatemalan and Salvadorean refugees. They, like the indigenous Mayans (about 11 per cent of the population), practise slash-and-burn agriculture while shooting and eating monkeys and parrots. Devising ways of tapping timber resources without wholesale destruction of forests is also a problem. So, too, is finding the manpower resources to police the reserves. For the time being, therefore, it may be advantageous that the country's tourist infrastructure remains relatively undeveloped.
19930303000000000	FT  03 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Paraguay's parrots get the last word - John Barham describes how the country is cracking down on the illegal trade in live animals. Good news about the trade in endangered species is rare, especially when it comes from Paraguay, where the illegal trade in live animals, birds and skins flourished for decades. During the 35-year regime of General Alfredo Stroessner, corruption and contraband were central to Paraguay's political system. Paraguayans hunted down caymans in wildlife refuges by the hundreds of thousands to sell their skins. The capital, Asuncion, became a centre of the shady international trade in live parrots, snakes and monkeys, though it was banned under Paraguayan law and international treaties. What is more, the smugglers moved in the same underworld as gun-runners, drug traders and car thieves. But in 1989, a military coup toppled Stroessner and Paraguay began making rapid, if uncertain, strides towards democracy. The government is anxious to improve Paraguay's dreadful image by taking action over human rights violations, corruption, smuggling and the illegal trade in animals. During the last 18 months, Paraguay has sharpened its environmental laws and promoted determined, honest individuals. The result is more seizures of skins and live animals that were once openly traded. Rich and powerful merchants find their links to the military no longer provide immunity. Even the Swiss-based United Nations' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), once a bitter critic, now recognises Paraguay is improving. Obdulio Menghi, Cites' scientific co-ordinator, says the Paraguayans 'are working like never before, because of the professional and political (commitment) that the country has assumed for the first time'. Change has come almost entirely as a result of intense international pressure from groups such as Cites. Luz Aquino-Shuster, head of the government's Cites liaison office, says: 'When I went to conferences, I would be pointed at and people would say Paraguay is a bad country. It was terrible.' Now, she gets letters of support. Moreover, she says: 'Biologists are in charge now. This is important, because before the politicians were in charge and they did not care.' The US Fish and Wildlife Service is advising the government on improving controls, a further sign that Paraguay's search for respectability is something more than a public relations stunt. However, the Paraguayans have little hard data to show for their work, although they do provide some graphic accounts of their seizures. For instance, in February, Aquino's staff seized 1,125 skins, coats, belts and shoes from a trader. They also fined a shop selling illegal furs and skins Dollars 37,500 (Pounds 26,600) - a princely sum by local standards. Since then, traders have become warier and seizures less frequent. Furthermore, some foreign governments caution that Paraguay's improvement is overrated, warning that corruption and smuggling still continue, if only with greater discretion. Nonetheless, the government is co-ordinating wildlife control operations with the army, police and customs, since the trade in animals is part of a wider underground market in drugs, arms and stolen cars. It is also sponsoring an environmental law in congress and Aquino hopes that smuggling animals - at present a civil offence - will be made criminal. Falling international prices have made her work easier. Hunters have glutted the market and demand in once lucrative Asian markets is declining. Warehouses around the world are stacked with enough cayman, iguana and boa constrictor skins to last many years. There is still a lot to be done. Menghi says: 'You have to struggle permanently against contraband, whether of animals, drugs or arms.' And several important European markets are still importing animals and skins, to the Paraguayans' fury. Clamping down on smuggling hits peasants and Indians, who are used to supplementing their incomes with hunting. Experienced hunters can easily catch a pair of adult parrots or shoot between 15 and 20 caymans a day, although they are paid very little. It is the middlemen who reap the profits: a parrot can retail for up to Dollars 10,000 in Los Angeles. The government is trying to ease this problem by allowing controlled exports of a few species whose numbers are not in danger. The main candidate for 'rational exploitation' is the heavily hunted Teyu Guazu iguana, whose skin is used to make handbags, belts and cowboy boots. In 1980-85, between 1.5m and 3.6m Teyu Guazu were exported. Closer co-operation is needed at regional level. Paraguay's neighbour, Argentina, is often criticised for lax controls and its security and conservation forces lack co-ordination. Smugglers habitually exploit its generous export licences to 'launder' species hunted in Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. However, Menghi says even Argentina is improving its controls. However praiseworthy these efforts may be, they do little to alleviate the destruction of habitats, the principal threat to wildlife. The situation is worsening by the day, as Paraguay's forests are cut down and farmers encroach on virgin territory.
19930524000000000	FT  24 MAY 93 / Trade bans may save the whale, but not the elephant. BIO-DIVERSITY is the environmental lobby's latest buzz-word. Translated, it means the more species, the merrier. But this diversity appears to be under threat, at least according to statistics compiled by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, which purport to show that species extinctions have risen rapidly over the past century. Humans cannot be blamed for the demise of all species, the extinction of the dinosaur being one obvious example. Let us accept, however, both that bio-diversity is worth preserving and that it is human beings who are responsible for the rise in extinctions in recent decades. What can be done to reverse the trend? The standard response, enshrined in numerous international conventions, is to ban economic exploitation of endangered species. Such a ban is the mechanism that the International Whaling Commission has used for over 40 years in its efforts to reverse the collapse in the number of blue and hump-back whales. A fortnight ago, at its 45th annual meeting, the IWC decided not to lift its ban on commercial whaling. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) hopes that by banning ivory trade it can reverse the demise of the African elephant, whose numbers halved between 1979 and 1989, implying a loss of over 700,000 elephants. The ban was imposed in 1989 and reconfirmed a year ago, despite opposition from southern African governments. Do such trade bans work? Not always, argues Mr Timothy Swanson in the latest issue of Economic Policy. A ban on commercial fishing may be an effective way of protecting threatened oceanic species from excess farming, he argues, but halting trade in elephant products is not. Whales are threatened with extinction for three reasons: they breed slowly; they are cheap to catch relative to the market price for whale products; and access is available to anyone with a boat and the necessary expertise. If access to whale farming were controlled by quotas, their numbers could theoretically be stabilised. In practice, a ban on commercial whaling is a more effective way of reducing the economic return for fishermen and thus discouraging their capture. But the success of this policy for preserving the whales depends on the assumption that, left to their own devices, whales would breed freely and flourish. The same argument does not apply to elephants, which do not have the luxury of living in huge oceans. The survival of land species, especially such large and potentially destructive animals as elephants, depends on the willingness of humans to preserve their habitat. This depends on their economic return, compared to other land uses. It is because investing in elephants has not been sufficiently profitable, at least in the poorest African states, that elephants are threatened. While the proximate cause for the decline in the number of African elephants in recent years seems to be the availability of high-power weapons and the relatively lucrative ivory trade, elephants were killed in large numbers because government did not find it profitable to stop the poachers. In the 1980s, four countries alone - Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan - lost 750,000 elephants. All spent less than Dollars 20 a year per square kilometre on park management. Zimbabwe, by contrast, spent Dollars 194 and saw its elephant stock rise by over 20,000. Little wonder that the higher spending governments of southern Africa are arguing for the ban on the ivory trade to be lifted. Banning trade reduces the incentive for African countries to keep poachers out of the parks or to preserve elephant-friendly habitats. If African elephants are to be saved, the economic return on elephant farming must be increased, rather than lowered, perhaps by granting export quotas to countries willing to invest in keeping the poachers out. Free trade in ivory may not be environmentally friendly, but neither is a trade ban. Timothy Swanson, 'Regulating endangered species', Economic Policy 16, April 1993.

19930918000000000	FT  18 SEP 93 / How we saved the rhino with rifle and chainsaw: Elizabeth Robinson watches a desperate attempt to beat the poachers. THE CONVOY giving chase through the African bush was an assortment of pick-ups, a Land Rover and trucks all being directed by a crackled message from a scout helicopter, call sign Z-HOT. Trackers had scoured the earth for clues and reported to the helicopter. When the animal came within 30m of the chopper - the range of the full-bore air pressure rifle on board - it was shot. In many cases, mothers and their young were felled within metres of each other; sometimes the baby panicked, ran off and collapsed as far as a mile from where its mother lay. Rhino hunting in Zimbabwe has found new impetus. But take heart - these are hunts to save the lives of a vanishing species, performed by vets using sleep-inducing darts, not the AKs of the poachers. Poaching has wiped out all but - at an optimistic estimate - 500 of Zimbabwe's rhinos; four years ago there were more than 2,000. The hunter's aim in both cases is the same: to remove the rhino's horn. A successful poacher will get less than Pounds 100 for the horn, which is then sold for as much as Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 13,000) in the Far East where it is thought to enhance sexual potency, or to Yemen to be made into highly prized dagger handles. A successful vet will hope that the dehorned rhino has been given a stay of execution. Zimbabwe has been dehorning its rhino population for a year, following the example of Namibia. Mark Atkinson, a vet for Zimbabwe's National Parks working almost exclusively on the dehorning programme, believes about 60 per cent of Zimbabwe's rhino population has been dehorned. He stresses that the programme is not a long-term solution to save the rhino, but prefers to call it 'crisis management'. In other words, the vets are trying to give the rhinos a respite from poachers so that the species can build its numbers up to a comfortable level. By dehorning the few left, the species may survive. It costs between Dollars 500 and Dollars 1,000 to dehorn one rhino. It can also take several days to track one animal, and a dozen or more burly men to heave the captured rhino into a crate for transportation to a safer area. With no dedicated rhino unit in Zimbabwe, the conservationists are desperate for any help they can get. The British Army's Mozambique Training Team, based in the east of the country, has been lending radios, trucks and muscle to Zimbabwe's effort. They helped to move seven rhinos at Lake Kyle which had been stranded when the rains came, and took part in a three-week operation to dehorn about 60 animals in the Bushey Park area. Under Lt Col Robert Martin, officers and senior NCOs from BMATT (British Military Advisory and Training Team) joined the veterinarian team and trackers at a private game lodge about three hours south of Harare. The vets particularly wanted help in dehorning and moving the white rhinos, which are more susceptible to stress than black ones. Once the trackers and vets have sighted and shot a rhino, the convoy of trucks with its winches and crates rushed to where the animal lay. A hood was placed over the rhino's head to shield its eyes and ears. The removal of the horn takes only a few minutes. Chainsaws cut through it as easily as through a small tree; the vet takes longer to shape the stump so that it will not become ingrown. Rhino horns regrow at an average of 8cm a year. Small slivers of horn are barely distinguishable from a human fingernail. Part of the exercise was to move the rhinos to a safer area - private gameparks or farms. A truck winched down a crate to lie with its open door facing the rhino and a rope was tied around the animal's huge snout. About eight soldiers took up positions around the animal to push it into the crate, while as many again were at the back of the crate ready to heave on the rope and pull the rhino in. Rather than shift two to three tons of deadweight, the animal was revived with a sleeping drug antidote and water was poured into its ear to wake it. As soon as it started moving, the heaving and pushing began until the door of the crate was closed on a very irate and confused beast. The crate was then winched on to the truck and the rhinos driven to a secret location where they are released into a corral and monitored before being taken to a safe area. There are so few rhinos left that the vets keep detailed identification details of each one they catch. As well as nicks cut out of their ears, age, condition and distinguishing marks being noted, 'mug shots' are taken. Seven rhinos were dehorned that weekend - one calf, at four to six months old, had no horn to speak of. Euan Anderson, a Zimbabwean vet, believes that since the dehorning programme started in Zimbabwe, four to five dehorned rhinos have been killed by poachers. This may be because when poachers have spent several days following rhino spoor they may kill the animal to cut off its ears as proof to their paymasters, or it may simply be that the poachers were not aware until after the shooting that the rhino they had been following was carrying nothing of value. To combat the latter, Zimbabwe has been advertising its dehorning programme on Zambian television - it is believed that the poachers come from Zambia, though some have hinted that the worst culprits are much closer to the Zimbabwe parks. Studies are in progress in Namibia and Zimbabwe to determine the long-term effect on the rhino's behaviour of having its horn removed. Euan Anderson believes that the rhino is not greatly affected. Even in self defence, as he says, if a three-ton beast charges towards impact at full speed, it does not much matter whether it has a horn or not. More than one of the officers involved in the rescue observed that 'Civvies would pay a fortune to do this'. Indeed, I felt privileged to be there to see the magnificent animals sleeping, touch their skin that feels like slightly spongy granite and stroke their ears, which on black rhinos are fringed with long silky black hairs. Zimbabwe had, in fact, investigated the possibility of selling 'rhino hunting', particularly to the US. The idea was that for around Dollars 30,000 a hunter would be given the facilities to track and dart a rhino, leaving the vets to do the rest, and take home the horn as a souvenir. However, the proposal met with outcry and resistance in the US. Another idea that the vets approve of is to flood the market with the huge stockpile of legally-removed rhino horn, force down the market price and thus make poaching unviable. They stipulate, however, that the revenues should be ploughed back into rhino conservation. Bushmen and vets in Zimbabwe are passionate in their commitment in saving the rhino from extinction. While Mark Atkinson was busy with the chainsaw, a vet from the US whispered: 'Your gardeners in England earn more than he does.' Earlier, on a walking safari deep in the bush of Hwange National Park, I was nervously quizzing my armed guide about the procedure should an animal charge (do not shoot until it is 10 feet away and approaching). And what if your party of tourists should be charged by a rhino? I asked. He shrugged.
19930908000000000	FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US to impose sanctions on China and Taiwan over rhino horn trade. THE US is set to go ahead with sanctions against China and Taiwan for illegally trading in rhino horns, irrespective of what the 120-nation UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) decides, David Gardner writes. The Cites standing committee, meeting in Brussels, was expected to reach a decision last night or today, after considering evidence that the two countries had failed to stamp out the trade, banned since 1976. But Mr Bruce Babbitt, US secretary of the interior, has said he will recommend that President Bill Clinton go ahead anyway with a ban on nearly all wildlife products moving from and into China and Taiwan, under a 1967 US law. EC officials yesterday said sanctions could be counter-productive at a time when the Chinese and Taiwanese governments were trying to end the rhino horn trade. Investigations by environmental organisations have turned up evidence that in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is still a brisk trade in rhino horns, a traditional Chinese remedy for reducing fever. According to the Environmental Investigation Agency, the price of Asian rhino horn has reached recent peaks of Dollars 60,000 a kilo, spurring poachers to prey on the sparse five surviving species. Zimbabwe last year registered 1,500 rhinos, according to Mr Dave Currey of EIA, but this year confirmed it had only 300. According to the EIA, worldwide stocks of black rhino are down to 2,300; white rhino to 5,200; Sumatran rhino to 500-900; Javan rhino to only 80; and Indian rhino to 1,900.
19930901000000000	FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (14): An issue the west ignores at its peril - Environment / The problems of over-population, over-cultivation and over-grazing. NO ISSUE divides Africa from the first world more strongly than the environment. While the west worries about the endangered black rhino and loss of bio-diversity, most Africans are too exhausted from the daily struggle to find fuel and water to care about the destruction of their environment. The priorities of each seem irreconcilable, and yet, they need not be. What is needed is a greater awareness in the industrialised world of how its policies exacerbate Africa's environmental crisis. And African governments need to place greater emphasis on combatting the extreme poverty which is a cause, as well as a result, of environmental degradation. There is little time to reverse the damage. At current growth rates, Sub-Saharan Africa's population of 600m will double in 22 years. The World Bank estimates the growth rate will decline from the present 3.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent at the end of the decade, as Aids takes its toll and family planning becomes more widespread. However, even this decline will not be enough to prevent the population doubling early in the next century. Already, women in the Sahel and many parts of east Africa walk 15km each day to gather a bundle of firewood. In a few years, there will be more mouths to feed and less wood to burn. Over-cultivation and over-grazing are transforming much of the continent into a vast wasteland: an area twice the size of India, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), is under direct threat of desertification. In addition, Africa is losing 2.7m hectares of woodlands every year. In most countries, forests are disappearing because people need land for farming, not wood to burn. When famine sweeps across Africa, the west calls it a natural disaster and spends billions of dollars in emergency food relief. But Africa's hunger is not simply a question of crop failure. In 1985, five out of six nations on a United Nations list of famine-afflicted countries were also racked by civil war. In Ethiopia, Chad, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, it was difficult to distinguish between drought-related famine and war-induced starvation. 'For the past 20 years, civil strife has indirectly wreaked as much devastation on the environment as any other cause in Africa,' argues Dr Roger Batty, an Oxford historian and consultant at UNEP. He believes western powers have been culpable of fuelling conflict by arming their client states on the continent. With the end of the cold war, however, superpower interest in conducting wars-by-proxy on the continent has evaporated, and it is hoped that the level of military aid to African governments will also fall. Environmental degradation can also add to the pressures from which conflict emerges. 'The next war in our region will be over the waters of the Nile, not politics,' Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, now the UN secretary-general, warned in 1985. The Nile basin touches on nine other countries, reaching as far south as Tanzania and Zaire. All upstream nations are keen to extend land under irrigation by tapping Egypt's only source of water. 'Without political imagination,' Mr Boutros Ghali continued, 'Egypt will become a new Bangladesh fraught with drought and famine - but with one difference. This Bangladesh will be on the shores of the Mediterranean, half-an-hour by jet from the rich people in the north.' Already, according to the UN High Commission for Refugees, there are 5m displaced people on the continent. To call them refugees would be a misnomer, for most will never be able to return to their homes. Many are fleeing land too degraded to support them. Others seek refuge from civil war, government repression, ethnic conflict, or simply the desperate poverty of rural areas. But up to now, the west has preferred to focus on endangered animals, rather than endangered humans. The expulsion of Maasai pastoralists from 4,800 square miles of traditional grazing land which became the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania was one of the first important battles fought by western conservationists in Africa. All over the continent, 'experts' imposed the theory that wildlife and people should be separated. This principle is now being challenged. 'It is hard to imagine that 150,000 tourists are not causing greater environmental damage and disturbing wildlife far more than 2,000 Maasai ever did,' says Mr Raymond Bonner, a US journalist and author of At the Hand of Man: Peril and Hope for Africa's Wildlife. New solutions are required which marry the needs of local people to those of the environment. In Luwangwa, Zambia, hunting rights are auctioned among safari companies and the revenues are channelled to the local tribes. As a result, villagers have started supporting the national parks service and set up security committees to prevent poachers entering into their areas. The number of poached carcasses of elephants and black rhinos in Luwangwa fell by 90 per cent between 1985 and 1987. The lesson to be learned is that Africa needs an economic incentive to protect its wildlife. But western institutions - be they tourist or pharmaceutical companies - are often reluctant to pay the price. Far more worrying than the endangered black rhino are Africa's disappearing insects and plants - species that could hold the cure for Aids. Already, Africa has destroyed 65 per cent of its original wildlife habitats. Concerns about the staggering loss of bio-diversity are not exaggerated. A substance discovered in the rosy periwinkle, a species unique to Madagascar, has quadrupled the survival rate for children suffering from leukemia. Worldwide sales of the rosy periwinkle drug now earn more than Dollars 100m a year, but not a cent has accrued to Madagascar in compensation for preserving the plant's habitat. A growing number of ecologists now argue that the best way of persuading African nations to protect their bio-diversity is by paying them to leave their natural resources intact. What is found in Africa may be needed in Europe and the rest of the developed world. Paper mills in the US and Japan, for example, are experimenting with an African plant, Kenaf, a relative of jute, which produces five times more pulp than the average tree. After 30 years of investigations, the US Department of Agriculture has singled out Kenaf as the most promising substitute to produce tree-free paper. It is an annual crop, whereas man-made forests require up to 60 years in the northern hemisphere to reach maturity. US newspapers which have tested Kenaf newsprint report that it is brighter, reproduces better pictures, and uses less ink, which does not stain hands. Africa's environmental problems are often portrayed in doomsday tones. In reality, they are neither insoluble nor insurmountable. What is needed is a radical reassessment of the value the industrialised world places on Africa's environmental health. It is an issue the west ignores at its peril.
19930828000000000	FT  28 AUG 93 / Travel: Puffins and polecats, at home in Wales - Islands, estuaries, Snowdonia. Michael J. Woods describes the wildlife of Wales, from cetaceans to the red kite. A STRANGE and mournful wail filtered up from beneath our feet as if some lost soul was crying in despair from the depths of the earth. The only light came from the flickering flames on the dark horizon and a slight glow from the stars as we stumbled forward. Something flopped away from us, struggling over the uneven grass like a grounded spirit of the night. Black and white, with wings outstretched, it made pathetic but vain attempts to take to the air. No effort was required to catch the bird; as I lifted it skywards, it spread its long wings and, returned to its true element, glided away with ease. It was a Manx shearwater, a short-term occupant of one of the old rabbit holes on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, in Wales. More than 100,000 come here every spring to nest in the shelter of their underground bunkers, safe from the predatory intentions of gulls. Flying aces, they glide over the stormy oceans with grace, dipping an occasional wing-tip in the water as if to belittle its power. On land they are all but helpless, staying hidden under ground during the day and only venturing out under cover of darkness. Their half-eaten corpses strewn on the rabbit-cropped turf, particularly around full moon, tell of a successful night's hunting for the gulls. In spite of the proximity of Milford Haven and the burning beacons of its oil refineries, Skomer is a diamond in the Welsh wildlife crown. In addition to shearwaters, it has large colonies of nesting sea-birds including puffins and guillemots. Choughs swirl around its cliffs while short-eared owls hunt its special Skomer voles. Skomer is also one of the most important breeding sites for grey seals in southern Britain: about 100 pups are born there every autumn. Wales is well-blessed with wildlife islands. Further off-shore from Skomer is Skokholm, which has storm petrels as well as many of Skomer's species; even more remote Grassholm supports one of the largest gannet colonies in the northern hemisphere. Ramsey Island, off St David's Head, has been purchased recently by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. A number of rare birds nest there including peregrine falcons; there is also a large grey seal colony and a herd of red deer. Also noted for its birds is Bardsey, accessible by boat from Pwllheli, which has its own bird and field observatory. All these islands, along with Anglesey and various headlands on the Welsh coast, are good spots from which to watch for passing cetaceans, although less-dedicated whale watchers might have more luck with the resident bottle-nosed dolphins which live in Cardigan Bay and can be seen off New Quay Head. In less rocky areas there are outstanding examples of salt marshes and estuaries of national and international importance around the Welsh coast, notably the Loughor estuary north of the Gower peninsula, the Cleddau, the Dovey and the Dee, Conway and Taff. The last three are under considerable pressure from development, and the main wildlife interest of the Taff estuary is likely to disappear if the Cardiff Bay barrage is constructed as planned. All have large populations of wildfowl, especially in the winter when they are important feeding grounds for significant flocks of waders such as godwit, redshank and oyster catcher, and ducks like pintail, widgeon and goldeneye. More picturesque than mudflats at low tide are the sandy beaches and their flower-rich dunes which are found, notably, around the Gower and nearby Kenfig and at Newborough Warren on Anglesey. Fine orchids grow in these unlikely places, including the southern marsh orchid, fen orchid, marsh helleborine and green-winged orchid. If it is an unusual beach you want, then try Shell Island south of Harlech where the empty shells of more than 70 different crustaceans may be found. The Snowdon massif makes a magnificent backdrop to this area and the summits of these, the highest mountains in Wales, have a flora that dates from the last Ice Age. On the most exposed tops you can find dwarf willow and reindeer moss, while in more sheltered spots are other Arctic-alpine species including cushions of purple saxifrage, mountain avens, Snowdon lilies and globe flowers. On the slightly lower slopes are sheets of heather which support both black and red grouse. The latter, startled by your approach, cries out 'Go back, go back' as it leaps into the air and glides away. In river gorges you may spot a ring ouzel, a shy relative of the blackbird with a white bib, not to be confused with the smaller, tubbier and more confiding dipper. There are feral goats up here, too: animals that have probably roamed the hills for centuries. At present there is conflict between the goats and local agricultural and conservation interests because of the damage they do to young trees and seedlings; selective culling takes place. But while you are quite likely to see the goats of Snowdonia, the gwyniad will almost certainly evade you. It is a small, herring-like fish - an Ice Age remnant - which occurs only in Bala lake. Unlike Bala lake, many of Wales' inland waters are man-made, tapping into the high rainfall of this hilly country to bring water to drier parts of Britain. Some of these reservoirs, especially in the Elan Valley and at Llyn Brianne, appear to be strongholds for the red kite. A success story for the work of the RSPB, the red kite has made a significant return, particularly in the past decade. While the RSPB's Dinas and Gwenffrwd reserve is the main centre for these birds, they range widely, and seeing one is a matter of keeping your eyes peeled for a fine chestnut bird with a forked tail. There are good chances of seeing otters in Wales, both on lakes and in rivers, while its relative, the polecat, is a Welsh speciality. This ferret-sized creature was persecuted to extinction in England, but has been hiding out in the Brecon Beacons and Tregaron Bog, a notable national nature reserve, and is now making successful incursions into its old haunts in the English west midlands.

19930821000000000	FT  21 AUG 93 / Despatches: Poachers close in on the tiger - India is home to two-thirds of the world's tigers. From 1973 to 1989 numbers doubled. But the poachers have returned and extinction again looms. PROTECTING the tigers of Ranthambhore, India's best-known wildlife reserve, almost cost Devi Singh Rathore his life. The 24-year-old forest guard was shot in the head, face and shoulder by a suspected poacher who fired at his Jeep with a shotgun. The guard sitting next to him took the full force of the blast and died instantly. A third man in the back of the vehicle was also killed and a fourth was injured. 'What happened was terrible,' says Rathore, wincing from the pain of the two pellets which are still lodged in his body. 'If this carries on it will be impossible to save the tigers.' The guards were attacked last April after being called out to track suspected poachers on the edge of the Ranthambhore reserve in the hot sandstone hills of southern Rajastan. After three days travelling from village to village in search of information, they stumbled across three men camping in a makeshift tent. They arrested two, but the third escaped. On the way to back to their HQ, the guards stopped for a meal and a rest. The delay proved fatal. The escaped poacher had got ahead of the guards and, knowing the road they would have to take, had laid an ambush. Choosing a steep-sided gorge, he rolled rocks into the road and hid behind the trees. When the Jeep arrived, the poacher opened fire with a crude muzzle-loading shotgun. Police later arrested a man and charged him with murder. Poachers have long been active in India's reserves, hunting tigers, leopards and other cats for their fur and small animals for meat. Most have been villagers living near parks with few other means of support. In the 1970s and 1980s, India had great success in protecting tigers through a national campaign called Project Tiger, launched in 1973. From one year to the next the numbers of Indian tigers went up. From about 2,000 in 1973, India's tiger population rose to 4,300 by 1989, out of an estimated world total of 6,000-7,000. Over the same period, India's human population rose by 60 per cent and the economy doubled in size. India's experience seemed to prove that even in a poor and over-populated country, protection of the environment and economic development were not incompatible. Ranthambhore, the beautiful former hunting preserve of the maharajahs of Jaipur, achieved particular fame because its tigers forsook traditional habits and became active during the day - supposedly because they now felt safe from man. The park, with its ancient forts, Moghul pavilions and lakes, attracted plenty of tourists. It was not until last year that conservationists realised that something was seriously wrong - when reports indicated alarming declines in the numbers of tigers at India's leading national parks. At Ranthambhore, the tiger tally dropped from 45 in 1991 to 17 last year, though the figure was revised this year to 28. For wildlife experts the conclusion seemed inescapable: tigers were disappearing so fast that their survival was at stake. Experts were quick to identify the origin of the new threat - an upsurge in demand for tiger bone for Chinese medicine. Chinese apothecaries believe tiger bone has the power to restore energy and sexual prowess. Factories in China, Taiwan and South Korea produce tens of thousands of bottles of tiger bone medicine for sale in east Asia and in Chinese communities around the world. Conservationists say these factories have in the past used bone from Chinese tigers, including a vast stock which was accumulated when over 1,000 tigers were hunted and killed as pests in the 1950s in southern China. In the last few years this stock seems to have run low, just at a time when fast economic growth has created millions of new customers for tiger bone medicine. The trade is quite open. Until recently apothecaries in Tihwa Street in Taipei displayed tiger bones in their windows, selling at a retail price of up to Dollars 1,500 per kilogramme. The Huangshi Long March pharmaceutical factory in Hubei province, northern China, puts a tiger emblem on its packets of musk and tiger-bone plasters for use in treating rheumatism. The first evidence of tigers being killed for their bones in India came in 1987 when poachers operating in the foothills of the Himalaya, in Uttar Pradesh, were found to have discarded a skin. Proof came last year at Ranthambhore when a local poacher named Gopal Mogya and an accomplice, a meat trader, were caught on the edge of the park carrying a gun and a bag of bones. The police say that Mogya confessed to selling bones and skins to a butcher in the nearby town of Sawai Madhopur. In turn, the butcher said he supplied Mohamed Ashiq and Mohamed Ahmed, two brothers who own a tanning business in Fatehpur, a centre of the leather industry, some 200 miles from Sawai Madhopur. Mohan Singh Bhati, the police superintendent at Sawai Madhopur, who estimates that 14-18 tigers have been poached from Ranthambhore, says it is the first time Indian police have broken such an extensive poaching ring. From Fatehpur, the trail led to New Delhi where the police are investigating several fur and skin traders but have made no further arrests. Wildlife experts working for Traffic, a unit of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which monitors trade in endangered species, say that Delhi is an important centre for dealing in skins, bones and other products. The principal traders are often Kashmiris, who have moved their businesses to Delhi. Kashmiris have a tradition of fur-making; they also have long-standing experience of trading with foreigners. They established world-wide networks in the fur trade before international agreements in the 1970s suppressed the legitimate trade in wild animal products. A few fur shops trade openly in New Delhi, for example in Yashwant Place, a run-down shopping centre favoured by hawkers dealing in smuggled wrist watches and Russian champagne. But Traffic's experts believe that most of the skins are smuggled out of India, mainly to Kathmandu in Nepal, where there is also a sizeable Kashmiri community. Nepal, like India, has tough laws against trading wild animal skins, but they are barely enforced. Tourists can easily buy coats made of leopard and other skins in shops near big hotels. Traffic researchers who visited the area last year counted 294 coats made from the skins of over 100 leopards, 14 clouded leopards and 2,500 other wild cats. Traffic says tiger skins and bones are smuggled out of India by the same route but are rarely seen because of the international publicity that tigers attract. The bones are mostly ground into powder and carried by couriers overland into Tibet or by air to Bangkok and Hong Kong. Vivek Menon, of Traffic's Delhi office, says it is futile trying to estimate how much bone is taken out of India. 'Very few people are arrested. And they are always the minions.' The conservationists' top priority is to try to stop the bone-related poaching. India, Nepal and China are all signatories of the 1973 Convention on Trade in Endangered Species, the main international agreement restricting trade in wildlife. In line with the convention, all these countries have passed tough laws against trade in the products of endangered species. But enforcement varies greatly. Even in India, which has a comparatively good record, there is a loophole that allows traders in Kashmir to deal in skins taken from pre-1979 stocks. Under pressure from conservationists, governments are starting to act. China has announced plans for an east Asian wildlife protocol, an agreement to restrict trade in wildlife, to be signed later this year by ministers from east Asian countries. But it is difficult to see what benefits the protocol will bring, other than to remind governments of their existing commitments. Kamal Nath, the Indian minister for the environment and forests, says protecting the tiger is an issue for all countries. 'We need help,' he says. The help he has in mind is pressure on east Asian countries brought by the US and other export markets. Conservationists also believe that important changes are needed in the running of the 19 reserves which now come under Project Tiger. These reserves are the pick of India's wildlife parks, sanctuaries not only for tigers but for numerous other species, including leopards, elephants and the country's last surviving rhinoceroses. The decline in the numbers of tigers has drawn attention to serious shortcomings in the management of these parks. Valmik Thapar, author of studies on the tigers of Ranthambhore, says the only way forward is to involve local people more in the running of the park. Former poachers would make good gamekeepers. Villagers could be encouraged to work as forest guards. Informants could be paid for tips about poachers. Without such efforts, the tiger may be doomed. Christian Tyler (Private View) and James Morgan (As They Say In Europe) are on holiday.
19930811000000000	FT  11 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Linking cash with conservation  -A wildlife scheme in Zimbabwe which is encouraging rural economic development. When the elephant was voted the world's most popular animal, you can bet the people of Hurungwe district in northern Zimbabwe were not consulted. Every year, they live in fear of elephants trampling through fields of maize that took months to prepare and tend. One night's feast for an elephant can wipe out an entire year's harvest. Homes might be wrecked if situated in the animals' paths. Children and adults are injured and sometimes killed. Why, then, are villagers thinking of constructing water dams and putting down salt to encourage elephants into their area? Why are they discouraging illegal settlers so that their land might be used instead by elephants? The answer lies in a novel programme which is giving economic value to elephants and other wildlife on Zimbabwe's communal lands. Under Campfire (Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources), rural communities are managing to make money from animals which until recently were poached as pests. The programme is simultaneously encouraging economic development and a conservation ethos in rural areas. Campfire works by linking cash with conservation. Until recently, rural communities were not allowed to make any use of wildlife on their lands  - poaching was common, either for food or to stop animals destroying crops and endangering people. Now, districts accepted into the programme are allowed to shoot a certain number of animals every year, for sale either as meat or safari trophies. The programme - run by the government and conservation organisations - gives rural communities a choice. They can shoot an animal that is damaging crops and sell its meat, earning, for example, about Pounds 1,600 for an elephant; or they can save the quota for safari hunting, where an elephant will earn the community Pounds 4,000-Pounds 6,000. A typical annual wildlife quota per district might include a variety of wildlife, such as seven elephants, 20 buffalo and 20 baboons. Campfire is creating an additional source of income for subsistence farmers. Last year, eight districts earned about Pounds 350,000 from safari hunting - mostly from Americans keen to collect an elephant trophy. Participating communities decide whether to invest the money in community projects - such as schools, dams or grinding mills - or divide it among households for personal use. In one ward, households earned Pounds 60 each from Campfire last year - a welcome addition to the average annual income of about Pounds 80. The programme is also encouraging the spread of business skills. Local Campfire committees are going into partnership with well-established safari operators to market their quotas; community investments are creating small-scale industries such as the grinding mills and bee-keeping; other tourist ventures are under way, such as hiking and photographic safaris. Cash and conservation are an attractive couple, says Lovemore Katena, a ward councillor in Hurungwe district. 'The best thing about Campfire is that we are learning to manage our resources and we benefit from them.' The conservation benefits are becoming clear. Villagers involved are actively discouraging wildlife poaching, confiscating snares, reporting poaching incidents and guarding against bush fires which are used to flush out animals but also destroy vegetation. They discourage illegal settlement and illegal gold panning, which contribute to the destruction of the land, rivers and vegetation. Only firm evidence of the link between conservation and economic development can maintain people's commitment to Campfire, says Cherry Bird, wildlife co-ordinator for Hurungwe district. 'Everybody has to feel they are benefiting tangibly from this programme so they'll be involved in management decisions. It sounds idealistic, but the alternative is to have no wildlife.' The nomadic nature of wildlife is proving a problem. The community where an animal is shot is the community that earns money - although several areas may have suffered crop damage en route. There is, therefore, no guarantee of a stable income from year to year. Some villagers argue they are being bribed to put up with wildlife. Others want their quotas increased so they can shoot more animals and earn more. Nevertheless, districts are queueing up to be accepted into Campfire. By the end of the year, 24 will have Campfire status and by 2000 more than half the country is expected to be devoted to wildlife conservation under the programme. Elephants - which are not an endangered species in Zimbabwe - remain the biggest earners under Campfire because of their status symbol to safari hunters. The hope is that other community businesses will become equally important to the local economies over time, says Ivan Bond, Campfire research fellow at the World Wide Fund for Nature. 'In the long-term, Campfire principles will have to be applied holistically to the whole range of natural resources. If the institutions exist for the management of one common property resource, it should not be too difficult to extend these to other resources.'
19930807000000000	FT  07 AUG 93 / Where to find the wild things: If you want to see a whale, pine marten or osprey, Michael J Woods knows the place. THE HIGHLAND midges were biting with fury on the evening I saw my first pine marten. But the rain held off and I sat quietly, smothered in insect repellent and with only my eyes peeping from my anorak hood, until a delicate, red-haired creature, the size of a small cat, picked its way among the mossy rocks and lichen-encrusted pine trunks to a bouldery den. The animal soon disappeared but I was well satisfied, for the pine marten is one of Britain's rarest native mammals. Scotland is certainly the place to see many of the scarcest species. Even if some are found elsewhere in Britain, they are often so uncommon that setting eyes on them is about as likely as seeing the Loch Ness monster. Take otters. Now absent from most of England and many parts of Wales, they are so widespread on the Shetland Islands that, during a week's stay, I enjoyed daily sightings and even spotted one playing in the wake of an inter-island ferry. The Forestry Commission has an otter-watching hide on Skye, at Kylerhea, though the locals claim that they are no more common there than elsewhere on the island, and any sheltered sea loch on the west coast of the mainland or the islands should reward the patient watcher with good sightings. When swimming, otters may be confused with seals, which also hang around coastal waters. There are boat trips to see colonies of seals basking on the rocks from several Scottish locations including Ullapool and Oban, and you may also be lucky enough to see whales and dolphins. If it is whales you want, you can take a special trip from Mull to look for minke whales or spend some time on one of the many headlands or islands along the coast, especially those overlooking the Minches, keeping an eye open on a calm day for the broken water which may divulge the location of a pod of cetaceans. It can be a frustrating business, for you know full well that somewhere beneath the surface groups of these great mammals are gliding past. If you want to see dolphins, you can shorten the odds by looking out for the resident schools off the Cromarty cliffs or from headlands in the Moray Firth. On land, Britain's largest mammal is the red deer. While they occur in England and Wales, many conservationists feel they have reached plague proportions in Scotland. Although they are stalked, shot and killed, these deer can be surprisingly confiding, especially if you come at them with the wind in your face and use the lie of the land to mask your approach. Two prime times for deer-watching are June, when the calves are born, and during the rut in October. Red deer are so widespread they are usually visible from the A9 road between Perth and Inverness; failing that they are common in the Cairngorms, with a deer reserve in Glen Muick near Ballater. There is also a well-researched herd on the Isle of Rhum where some scientists believe that the only pure British red deer herd may soon exist (mainland reds are increasingly breeding with introduced Japanese sika deer). Apart from the reindeer, brought in in 1952, the Cairngorm area is a good place to look for mountain hares, notable in the winter when their coats becomes white, and also wild cats, though seeing a wild cat is a matter of chance. If you are lucky you may spot one on a quiet walk in lonely countryside or perhaps see a thick-tailed tabby dash across a country lane in the beam of your headlights. Birds are much more predictable than most mammals, especially in the nesting season, and dramatic sea bird stacks and islands are found all round the Scottish coasts, with large colonies of various species. There are spectacular gannetries on Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, on St Kilda and on Unst; nocturnal shearwaters have nesting burrows on Rhum and the Shetland Islands; and noisy kittiwakes, guillemots and razorbills crowd the ledges in many places. Scotland is probably best known for its raptors, especially golden eagles and ospreys. The former frequent remote mountains and cover huge territories, so seeing one is a matter of luck. Recognising many of these birds of prey can be difficult as they are often seen as silhouettes against a bright sky at indeterminate height, so that judging size becomes a problem. A large bird with white underparts plucking trout from a loch is a different matter, and very obviously an osprey. These have been a conservation success story since the mid-1950s. It is still possible to see them from the special hide at their nest at Loch Garten, while the Scottish Wildlife Trust has an osprey site at Loch of Lowes near Dunkeld. Apart from the sheets of purple heather which flower in August and September, there are a number of specialities to delight the botanist. The shell sand machair of the Outer Hebrides is a distinctive habitat which supports a variety of orchids and other lime-loving species while, for the mountain plant enthusiast, Ben Lawers, in particular, has Arctic-Alpine flowers such as gentians and saxifrages. The native pine forests of Scotland, of which only fragments remain, are a sight still sought by many. As a centre for the mountains, the Aviemore area, with its pine forests, reindeer and ospreys, together with the chance of seeing eagles and red deer, is hard to beat. But if it is otters and seals you want, with the possibility of cetaceans, too, then Shetland, Skye or Ardnamurchan and Sunart can be good. Perhaps, instead of suffering the midges, it would have been better to have encouraged my pine marten to visit me in some well-located self-catering accommodation. A fortnight might just be enough. These animals have a sweet tooth, and small squares of bread and jam left out for them are said to work well. Others, though, swear by chocolate blancmange: the animals cannot carry it away, so they have to eat it on the spot. Busta House Hotel, Shetland (tel: 080-622 506) has otters almost at the front door. Skyes Charters, Skye (047-032 413) offers weeks of sailing classic boats with plenty of wildlife included. Whale-watching trips from Mull with Richard and Judy Fairbairns can be organised on 06884-223. Rhum Castle, Isle of Rhum, is a good place for red deer, otters and re-introduced sea eagles (0687 2037). In Edinburgh, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is at 17 Regent Terrace (Edinburgh EH7 5BN). The Scottish Wildlife Trust is at Cramond House, Cramond Glebe Road, Edinburgh EH4 6NS.

19931023000000000	FT  23 OCT 93 / Travel: Kenya - just beating around the bush - Afraid of being eaten, Michael Thompson-Noel still got close to elephants and seven cheetah. DAY 1, 2pm: Happiness is seeping into me, like a welcome dose of painkiller. I am at Rekero Farm, under the crest of Kipeleo hill, in the north-western part of Kenya's Masai Mara conservation area, watching elephants drinking at a water-hole which is fed by a year-round spring. The elephants snort and push, and spray themselves with dust. I arrived from London yesterday and was transferred at once to Nairobi's smaller airport where I caught a charter flight to an airstrip in the Mara. Total travelling time from Heathrow: 12 1/2 hours. Impact on the psyche: immediate and considerable. My regret at transiting Nairobi: absolutely zero. Richard Leakey, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, admits that the back streets of Nairobi, where lynchings are commonplace, some by necklacing, are now no safer than the back streets of Miami, and that the city's vice and violence have played a role in the decline in Kenyan tourism. Ron Beaton, who runs Rekero Farm with Pauline, his wife, says: 'Staying overnight in Nairobi is a complete waste of time. It used to be a fun city; now it's a den of iniquity.' So to hell with Nairobi. By now the wind has shifted slightly. The elephants have smelt me. Irritably they wave their trunks. They glare across the water-hole. Crossly, they move away. The peace at Rekero - a private home with accommodation for six guests  - is as fine as its old-time hospitality. Guests sleep in twin thatched cottages which overlook the water-hole, 30 yards away. There is wildlife all around, including, says Ron Beaton, three prides of lion. Beaton is a third-generation Kenyan with a farming and wildlife background. 'If clients are hyper on seeing the Big Five (lion, leopard, Cape buffalo, black rhino and elephant),' he cautions, 'then they'd be better off in the game lodges. Here, we put more emphasis on an authentic African experience than on cut-glass luxury.' Yet Rekero is perfectly civilised. This morning Ron led our little group on a game-drive and walk. I much preferred the drive. Game-walks make my heart race. You can trudge along for hours, scarcely seeing a thing. You could easily be eaten. I imagine it happens often: a roar and a thud and - arrghhh] What surprised me this morning was that we saw seven cheetah from a range of a few feet. They virtually ignored the vehicle. First we saw two males, walking slowly across the plain, their cheeks bloodied from breakfast. Then a female with a cub (the only survivor of three). And then a female with two cubs, barely four weeks old, vulnerable and mewling. When they skittered away, the female called to them anxiously. Day 2, 6pm: I am sitting alone on Rekero's veranda. The others have gone for a walk, heedless of gathering lion and of other unspeakable dangers. I am flipping through the pages of African Hunter, a dinosaur of a tome even when it was published in 1975. It is a reverential guide to the business of slaughtering wildlife by a man, James Mellon, who had shot approximately 450 African game animals. In Chapter II, in a section about Tanzania, Mellon discusses methodology: 'Leopard occur virtually everywhere in Tanzania and can be attracted to dead bait without much difficulty. Many huge old toms have been taken in the north along the korongos (dry watercourses) of Masailand, but with luck a trophy cat can be shot almost anywhere. Where circumstances permit, leopard can sometimes be drawn out of thick cover by beaters and shot on the run with 00 buckshot. But baiting in trees with putrid carcases is usually more successful.' Today, Richard Leakey says that Kenya's conservation efforts are producing good results. Nearly 28,000 square miles are protected areas. In the past two years Kenya has attracted more than Dollars 150m (Pounds 99.3m) in outside aid to spend on wildlife conservation and the necessary infrastructure. 'It is often claimed,' he says, 'that in Kenya more and more tourists are clustering round fewer and fewer animals. Yet of 52 national parks and reserves, only seven are accessible to mass tourism. 'Our security is excellent. We have 900 armed men, plus good surveillance and intelligence. In general, the standard of safety for tourists in our parks is good, and commercial poaching has been reduced virtually to zero. 'One of the biggest problems now is destruction of crops by elephants. We are losing 50-60 elephants a year - no more than 10 in the national parks - as a result of attacks by villagers, compared with the thousands being lost previously. 'Kenya is firmly opposed to any renewal of trade in ivory and rhino horn for at least five years. If trade in ivory were to restart in any part of Africa, the black market would start again and we would face renewed serious security problems in our national parks. 'Numbers? Kenya's black rhino population is certainly now 400-450, compared with 300-350 four years ago. There are 80 white rhino, which are not indigenous, mostly on private land, and about 26,000 elephants, compared with a low of possibly 18,000.' Day 3, 4pm: Now I am at Ol Donyo Wuas - it means spotted hills in Masai - more than 200 miles south-east of the Mara, in the foothills of the Chyulu hills which run between Amboseli and Tsavo national parks. This is supremely beautiful country: semi-arid, with a short-grass plain stretching to the horizon on which, 45 miles away, Mt Kilimanjaro is propped. Annual rainfall hereabouts: 20 inches annually. The nearest source of water: a village 23 miles away. Ol Donyo Wuas is owned and run by Richard Bonham, a buccaneering bachelor - he is a qualified commercial pilot - who specialises in unusual safaris, including walking-and-boating adventures from his camp on the Rufiji river in Selous game reserve, southern Tanzania. Accommodation at Ol Donyo Wuas is in four comfortable cottages, limiting guests to a maximum of eight. Activities available include game drives and walks, horse riding, horse safaris (you stay in camps each night) and bird shooting (July to October). Because of the dryness there is less game here than in the Mara, but there is still quite enough. Unsurprisingly, Bonham rates the location of his home one of the most startling in Kenya. He discovered it from the air. Like Ron Beaton in the Mara, Bonham works closely with the local Masai, who view him as a friend and from whom he rents his land. I asked Bonham what he did to help the Masai, beyond his role as an employer. He said: 'I represent them on a wildlife committee; run a cropping programme; have set up a women's workshop, which I use as a forum for wildlife education; have established a trust which pays for wildlife scholarships and for schoolbooks. And if someone gets mauled by animals, I try to cover the cost.' A year ago he was asked to rescue a 17-year-old Masai who had been badly mauled on a lion hunt. The lion had killed a cow, so a dozen warriors hunted it. Three speared it; then the 17-year-old was mauled. Bonham rescued him and flew him to the best hospital in Nairobi which patched him up. Medical bills alone ran to Dollars 1,500. The warrior recovered; now he is a herder. A Masai lion-hunt must be a sight-and-a-half. The warriors run the beast down - stamina is not its forte - and are armed only with spears. The most courageous warrior is the one who grabs the lion's tail and holds on to it. Usually the warriors are juiced-up on a decoction of the bark of acacia nilotica, which acts as a powerful stimulant. It is a fine plant, the acacia. Other members of the subfamily are used by medicine men for treating diarrhoea, intestinal worms, itchy rash, female sterility, snake bite, malaria, bubonic plague, bleeding, skin eruptions, brain infections, swellings, and head or body sores. Day 4, 5pm: For a final dose of painkiller I have travelled, via Nairobi, to the comfortable tented camp on Funzi Island, 40 miles south of Mombasa, where the pleasant mindless life of small tropical islands anywhere is abundantly in evidence: fishing, goggling, swimming, or idling through the mangroves. In an hour's time I start my return trek to London. It gets harder every time. Michael Thompson-Noel's trip was organised by Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions. The company's new brochure is published next week: 8 Comeragh Road, London W14 9HP, tel: 071-381 8638, fax: 071-381 0836. There is a 15-day 'Homes of Kenya' holiday in the new brochure which takes in Ol Donyo Wuas, Rekero Farm and Funzi Island, plus Sangare Ranch in the foothills of the Aberdares. Based on four people travelling together, the price is Pounds 2,795 per person (Jan-Nov) or Pounds 2,930 (Dec).

19931009000000000	FT  09 OCT 93 / Gardening: A bird in the box is worth . . .. A GHOSTLY white bird floating across the road in the dark just glimpsed in the headlights is the only view many people have of a barn owl. Sadly for many owls it is their last sight of anything as, with their eyes blinded by headlights, they crash and perish. But road verges are one of the few hunting grounds left to them, especially in arable areas where hedgerows have disappeared. There, in rough grass, barn owls can find the voles and mice they need to survive. For over half a century, barn owls have been in decline in Britain as their food habitats and their nesting sites in old buildings have disappeared. For almost the last 20 of those years it has become increasingly popular to breed these owls in captivity and to release their progeny into the wild. Owls have been farmed out to individuals who felt they were doing something positive for the survival of the species. After all, these rather ugly, large-beaked, fluffy young, with their far more beautiful, speckled-plumaged mothers, were living proof of the conservation effort they were making. But it is now known that this is far from the case. According to the Hawk and Owl Trust, some 3,000 young barn owls are released each year - when the total wild population is only 4,500. If all that was needed were more owls, then you would have expected a population explosion. But this has not happened, for young birds, bred in captivity and inexpertly released, are pathetic at adapting to the wild. The British Trust for Ornithology suggests that only 10 per cent survive and it doubts that captive-bred barn owls have boosted the wild population at all. The real problems - food and lodging - were being missed. The lack of nest sites is simple to deal with - erect an owl box. The big difficulty is the lack of rough grassland. It is the need to increase this habitat, and hence the number of mice and voles which live there, which has been such a problem. The recent changes in agricultural policy, leading to the establishment of schemes such as set-aside, together with the extension of Environmentally Sensitive Areas, could see the restoration of many acres of rodent rich grassland. The need for funds to monitor this work, in order to better advise and plan for the future, is the basis of a new appeal from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. With more food available, captive-bred barn owls may survive better after release. On the other hand, with its basic needs attended to, the existing wild population may grow unaided and captive breeding can cease.
19940202000000000	FT  02 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Profits from preservation - As many US zoos are privatised, they are beginning to undergo an ecological awakening. Hanging in the personnel offices of the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston is a poster which reads: 'Extinction is forever.' At the hot dog stand, a message has been taped to the napkin dispenser: 'Please conserve. Save a tree.' At the African tropical rain forest exhibit, an entire wall is devoted to explaining the ecological dangers facing rain forests in the world. Welcome to the modern zoo, a hotbed of environmental activism. Zoos and aquariums have come a long way since the dark days of cramped cages and disregard for animals in the wild. While the image emanating from Hollywood is still negative - the popular children's film Free Willy, about a whale, caused an international furore last year when its decrepit real-life living conditions in Mexico City were discovered - most US zoos and aquariums today are highly sensitive to environmental concerns. Zoos in the US are now seeking to redefine their ecological role in the face of increasing fund shortages. Since many US zoos and aquariums have been privatised, they are more dependent on their own revenue streams, and are under pressure to set priorities. The challenge will be to continue environmental programmes in a cost-effective way. 'Increased co-operation between international zoos will become more important in the face of severe fund shortages,' says Michael Wallace, curator of conservation at the Los Angeles Zoo. Animal conservation will continue to be one of the mainstays of zoos' ecological efforts. 'Zoos went through an awakening on animal conservation,' says John Linehan, general curator for the Franklin Park Zoo. 'In the past, we'd be happy if the animals had a few babies now and then, to attract the public, but that was the extent of our breeding efforts. Then we started noticing that animals were getting harder to find and more expensive. We realised this great resource we had, and that we could become a major player in animal conservation.' A number of species exist only in captivity, and zoos and aquaria breed these species to prevent extinction. Reintroduction of the animals into the wild is the ultimate goal in many cases, and some zoos have chalked up stunning successes in this area. The Arabian oryx, a large antelope, for example, was extinct in the wild until zoos began to reintroduce the animal in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, several hundred roam the deserts of Oman. Similarly, the black-footed ferret was successfully reintroduced in Wyoming, and the Sumatra tiger in Indonesia. There are numerous pitfalls to reintroduction, however. The programmes are extremely expensive to administer, so the number of targeted species must be limited. Moreover, many involved in the industry complain that zoos and aquariums are too often the last-ditch effort. 'Reintroduction from zoo populations is usually a last resort, an after-thought,' says Michael Hutchins, director of conservation and science at the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. 'Releasing animals back into the wild would be more effective - and less expensive - if we did it before numbers dwindled to a dangerous level. It's a lot easier to boost the numbers of existing populations than to create a population from scratch.' Zoos hope to correct this problem by becoming increasingly involved in 'in situ' conservation - that is, conservation in the wild. Involving local people is the key to an effective reintroduction programme, say conservationists. Poverty-stricken people understandably see conservation as a luxury, and will often not hesitate to hunt endangered species, or log forest areas necessary for the species' survival. Along the Atlantic coast of Brazil, for instance, locals have been employed as guards and monitors for the golden-eyed tamarin. 'The people who are dependent on this animal's survival to make a living become staunch protectionists,' says Benjamin Beck of the National Zoo. Zoos and aquariums also see education as a priority in their preservation efforts. According to AAZPA, whose members had a budget of Dollars 825m (Pounds 557m) last year, 105m people visited a zoo or aquarium in the US last year. 'That gives us a tremendous potential to reach the public,' says Hutchins. As an added advantage, educational programmes are relatively inexpensive to administer. In addition, aquariums are especially good at incorporating animals into their entertainment mix. Marine animal 'acts' often include environmental messages. A sea lion at the New England Aquarium, for instance, makes a show of tossing rubbish into the appropriate recycling containers. While conservation efforts and education will continue, ecological fund-raising at many zoos is likely to be curtailed over the next few years. With limited resources, zoos say they cannot afford to raise money for causes other than their own. So benefits for other wildlife organisations are likely to be phased out. Research is also controversial, with many institutions believing funds are too short to stretch themselves far in that area. Indeed, the availability of funds over the next few years will help determine the number of environmental projects zoos and aquariums involve themselves in. Environmentalism is important, say zoo officials and managers, but they cannot afford to lose sight of their main function, which is to provide entertainment. 'If people don't have fun, they will stop coming,' says Ronald Tilson, director of conservation at the Minnesota Zoo, 'and that will be the end of our ecological involvement. While we're worrying about environmental issues we have to make sure that our visitors are having a good time with the animals. In the end, that may be the most important message of all.'
19940318000000000	FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (35): Where the bison roam free - Bronwen Maddox visits an unspoiled wilderness where wildlife abounds. The long, scuffed tracks in the snow between the trees give some warning. But it is still a shock when the black, shaggy bulk of a bison, one of the largest and rarest wild creatures in Europe, emerges out of the forest shadows at the roadside. Poland's environment contains some of Europe's extremes: Silesian filth in the south-west, and undisturbed wilderness in the east. The government is keen for the wilder regions to attract tourism. But while Polish environmentalists are worried about the impact of development, so far the remoter regions remain astonishingly unspoiled. Two hours east from Warsaw, the road becomes entangled in the Biebrzy marshes - 100 kilometres of peat bog, the largest in Europe. Naturalists recite its catalogue of wildlife with reverence: 36 species of fish and 235 species of birds, which make it a stopping point on the north-south migration routes. When it floods in the spring, it becomes half land, half water; horses become stranded trying to cross it, people resort to dinghies, and only the marshes' 400 wild moose, with huge, splayed hooves, can venture across safely. The real heart of the Polish wilderness, however, is still further east. The Bialowieza, Europe's last primeval forest, is a dark, ungroomed tangle of oak and ash, straddling the border with Belarus. For years the region has been a twilight zone of half-forgotten villages connected by potholed roads. The ethnic and religious homogeneity of much of Poland yields to a central European medley; the small Ukrainian and Belarus communities are marked by the domed spires and double-barred crosses of Orthodox churches. The region's isolation has helped preserve species rare elsewhere. Golden-beaked eagles crouch in the grass over dead chickens, while wild boar gouge troughs in the snow looking for nuts, and the deeper forest recesses conceal lynx and wolves. But the undisputed pride of the forest is the bison, coaxed back from near extinction after the war, when only six were left alive. The forests, formerly hunting grounds for aristocrats, were protected as a nature reserve under communism. After careful breeding, there are now 251 bison roaming the forests in dozen-strong bands, 37 in compounds at the forest's centre, and another 300 on the Belorus side of the border. Taller and slimmer than the North American buffalo, their heads are larger and thrust further forward. Adult males weigh up to 1,000 kilos, with foot-long pointed horns. 'They have a wild temper - there is no possibility of a person touching them,' say the foresters. Mr Zbigniew Krasinski, head of bison research at the reserve, says: 'We are looking for signs of problems because the genetic pool is so small, such as a drop in fertility or physical deformation. But so far we have found none.' Poaching is a concern - hunters do not attack the bison directly, but their snares entangle the animals' muzzles and hooves. So is the antagonism of farmers bordering the forest, whose crops are regularly raided by adventurous herds. But one of the reserve's most controversial tasks is keeping down the numbers - the bison, which mainly eat grass, also strip the bark from ash and oak. The reserve exports as many bison as it can to other regions of Poland and abroad. However, it still must shoot several dozen a year to keep the population stable. The staff 'pick the ones with defects - those which are weaker, or were late calves, or limp', says Mr Krasinski. Bialowieza has rejected the route taken by other Polish reserves in the north-east and south-east where hunters are permitted to pay to shoot the bison for sport. According to Mr Krasinski, the right to shoot a large bison with impressive horns - 'a gold model' animal - fetches about DM11,000 (Dollars 6,250). 'Maybe shooting would be profitable but there is a strong lobby of environmentalists who say 'not in the Bialowieza - you can't shoot the king of forest in his castle',' says Mr Krasinski. That decision leaves the reserve with slender finances. It enjoyed 100,000 visitors a year before 1989, mainly large expeditions from state factories, but now receives only 60,000, of which only 5,000 come from outside Poland. The foresters are sanguine, however. 'We don't want mass tourism here', says Mr Krasinski. 'Sure, money is a problem, but somehow we always manage.'
19940307000000000	FT  07 MAR 94 / African task force to combat wildlife traffickers. Law enforcement officers from nine African countries are meeting in Nairobi this week to create a regional task force to fight international crime syndicates dealing in ivory, rhino horn, diamonds, arms and drugs. 'We need a highly mobile team of officers with the authority to operate across borders to penetrate. . . increasingly sophisticated smuggling networks,' says Lt Col Pieter Lategan of the South African police force's Endangered Species Protection Unit. 'With an African task force, we could place wildlife traffickers under surveillance as they move across borders, so that entire networks, and not just individuals, could be apprehended,' he said. Trafficking in wildlife is on the rise, and has become linked to illegal trade in weapons and drugs across southern and eastern Africa. Mr Lategan's unit impounded 2,200 tusks last year - hacked into 22,000 cubes to facilitate smuggling - compared with 130 tusks in 1992. Kenya seized more than 1,000 kg of ivory in 1993 in a case involving five Koreans and one Ethiopian smuggler. Officials from Kenya's Wildlife Service, who have won plaudits worldwide for their anti-poaching efforts, say they need freedom to cross borders when pursuing poachers and smugglers. They would also welcome extradition treaties to trap ring leaders of international networks. Zambia arrested 1,500 poachers in 1993 and seized more than 2,000 automatic weapons. Uganda is concerned with the growing trade in chimpanzees and rare birds. Swaziland says it has lost 60 per cent of its white rhino population since poachers invaded the landlocked kingdom in 1988. 'Hardened criminals are what we are often up against,' says a Swazi police officer. 'They deal not only in poaching, but in gun-running, drugs, grand larceny and murder.' Mozambique, which is emerging from a 17-year civil war, has become a free-for-all for poaching gangs, including foreign armed forces who regularly invade Mozambique from neighbouring countries. According to the law enforcement officers at the Nairobi conference, it is known that Zambians and Malawians hunt elephants in Tete province, while Tanzanians and Somalis operate along the Rovuma river in northern Mozambique. Officers believe an African Task Force would give them more power to address corruption within their own customs, police and armed forces. The delegates, from Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia hope the anti-smuggling task force will be operational in 12 months.
19940412000000000	FT  12 APR 94 / World Trade News: US wildlife embargo on Taiwan. US President Bill Clinton yesterday imposed an embargo on imports of wildlife products from Taiwan because it had failed to stem trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts, animals in danger of extinction, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. China escaped similar sanctions after the US determined that it consolidated and burned its stocks of rhino horn and tiger bone and enforced laws against such trade. The US action came under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
19940402000000000	FT  02 APR 94 / Travel: Survival is a dogfight for the wild bunch - Wild dogs in Africa may become rarer than the rhino. Michael J Woods tracked them down. There was a dull pock, like the sound of a tennis ball bouncing lightly on grass, as the compressed air-gun expelled its tranquilliser dart. The African wild dog sprang to its feet as if it had been stung. With a yelp it dashed off, a red woollen tassel dangling from the syringe in its shoulder. 'It won't go far,' said Dr Gus Mills, and we sat in his truck for the 10 minutes needed for the drug to work. It took a little time to find the sleeping dog in the thick bush, as its black, white and tan blotched coat blended remarkably well with the broken shadows cast on the grey dusty soil. Once located, though, a radio collar was swiftly fitted, a sample of blood taken and the antidote injected. In less than a minute the dog was on its feet and had gone to join the rest of Mbyamiti pack, which now had two dogs carrying radio transmitters. Gus Mills is a scientist who works in Kruger national park, a long rectangular area about the size of Wales on the eastern boundary of South Africa. He has been researching African wild dogs, also known as Cape hunting dogs, for some years. His subjects are rangy animals with noticeably large rounded ears, three-coloured coats and a height of a little over 2ft. They are efficient hunters, running as a pack and killing at dawn and dusk if they can, and lying-up in shade during the heat of the day. Only for the short breeding period are they tied to a den; for the rest of the year they are nomadic and appear to need a large territory to survive. There are only about 360 wild dogs in Kruger; the lion and hyena populations both top 2,000 for the same area. All is not well with wild dogs. They have become very scarce in Africa - rarer, some say, than the rhino, which makes them Africa's most threatened large carnivore. Historically, their undeservedly bad reputation has led to persecution by farmers. Until 20 years ago, they were even shot in some national parks. There are still farmers who will not tolerate dogs and consider them vermin, so that packs straying from conservation areas are at risk. Only big stretches of protected wilderness will suffice to provide wild dogs with enough space to survive. The national parks in the north of Botswana and Zimbabwe and in the south of Tanzania fulfil these requirements, and contain reasonable numbers of dogs. But these very extensive areas are largely unpenetrated by roads and, for the discerning visitor, for whom a glimpse of a dog is more exciting than any of the big five (lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, buffalo), spotting one is extremely difficult. Things seem to be slightly easier in Kruger. Finding them by radio is the only way that researchers such as Gus Mills can ensure that packs are monitored on a regular basis, and dogs are often seen by visitors to the park. In fact, Gus was able to use tourist sightings of wild dogs to obtain a measure of the number of animals in the park. By offering a free film for every usable photograph of a dog, he soon had pictures of almost every animal. The dog population in Kruger is one of the densest so far recorded in Africa, and the extensive network of roads is frequently used by packs on the move. 'Morning and evening are the best times to look for dogs,' Gus told me. 'That is when they hunt, for they rest in the heat of the day and then their low profile and disruptive coloration make them almost impossible to spot.' Kruger has much to offer in addition to wild dogs. I came across lions and elephants in abundance along with rhino and giraffes. Many of the smaller animals, so often missed elsewhere, are visible here, too. I found a dwarf mongoose den by the roadside and was able to watch the lightning activities of its delightful inhabitants as they foraged through the undergrowth and then rocketed across open areas for fear of raptors. On two occasions I had to wait for leopard tortoises to cross the track and once swerved to avoid a chameleon, bright green against the khaki sand, rocking its way so very slowly over the ruts. But it was wild dogs I wanted to see, and the more I questioned Gus Mills, the more mysteries I encountered. Packs, for instance, fluctuate markedly in size, and Kruger's Skukuza pack, which numbered 40 dogs in 1989, now consists of just three males. Dogs disappear in large numbers for no apparent reason, and bodies are rarely found. This was the reason for putting a collar on a second animal of the Mbyamiti pack, as an insurance against the death or disappearance of the dog already collared. In Kruger, a wild dog's expectation of life is unusually short - rarely beyond four years (a hyena's is about 15). Gus has heard several accounts of lions killing both adults and pups, and would like to investigate more fully the role lions play in the lives of dogs. Fortunately, international awareness is growing. The Kruger wild dog study is funded by the National Parks Board and the independent Stuart Bromfield Wild Dog Fund of the Endangered Wildlife Trust. This trust also finances other wild dog projects in South Africa, along with the newly-established Licaone Fund in Italy. Meanwhile, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has published an action plan for African wild dogs, so there is considerable hope for the future. I spent a week in Kruger, and it wasn't until my last day that I found dogs for myself. The sun was sinking and, briefly, painting the bush a golden green. The insects were tuning up for their evening chorus and the cacophony of guinea fowl was at its loudest. There was a sudden snort from an impala ram in the undergrowth beside the vehicle and he quickly made himself scarce. Then I was aware that, coming towards me along the road ahead, were a dozen lean dark silhouettes with familiar big round ears. The long legs carrying those lithe bodies touched the ground so lightly that the animals almost seemed to float along in a distance-devouring trot. I stopped quickly and the grinning dogs went by. The sun lit them for a second, then they wheeled and melted into the trees - a moment of pure magic. Michael Woods was a guest of the South African Tourism Board (London tel: 081-944-8080) and Kruger national park. He flew from Bristol to Amsterdam with KLM and then caught its long-haul flight to Johannesburg. KLM runs a similar service from 16 UK regional airports, thus avoiding the often time-consuming journey to London and the two-hour check-in.
19940528000000000	FT  28 MAY 94 / Hunters harpooned: The whales might finally be saved. The decision by the International Whaling Commission to set up a sanctuary around Antarctica is being hailed as a victory for the green movement's whale diplomacy. 'This is the end of deep-sea whale hunting,' said Gordon Shepherd of the World Wide Fund for Nature. 'The Japanese whale industry is dead.' The sanctuary, to be monitored bu Australia, would link up with an existing safe area in the Indian Ocean, to protect about 80 per cent of the world's surviving whales, and indefinitely put off-limits some 750,000 minke whales that Japan says are legitimate commercial targets. At the annual commission meeting in Puerta Vallarta, Mexico, attended by representatives from the industrialised world and international environmental groups, Japan was the only country to vote against the sanctuary, with Norway, which does not hunt in the Antarctic, refusing to vote. Japan is now threatening to withdraw from the commission, which in principle would allow it to resume hunting. The triumph of the environmentalists is partly symbolic, since commercial whaling is prohibited under a moratorium in effect for eight years. While the commission is considering lifting the ban, most observers believe a decision will not be made for years. Nevertheless, the sanctuary is viewed by the greens as an essential safety net, amid signs that the moratorium is 'leaking'. Norway has recently resumed limited commercial minke whale hunting off its coastline in the north-east Atlantic, while Japan kills about 300 minke whales a year in the Antarctic for 'research' purposes - allowed under the moratorium. Activists believe that Japan will give up research killings in the Antarctic sanctuary now there is no hope of commercial hunting. The sanctuary may have wider implications. Some campaigners see the 23-1 vote as a vindication of their tough tactics, which included threatening the Caribbean supporters of Japan's position with a tourism boycott. 'We can definitely learn from this and apply it to other animals,' says Kate O'Connell, an environmentalist based in Colombia. The governments of non-whaling countries such as the US, the UK, France and Germany are happy to go along with the environmentalists because of the domestic political credit they earn. 'They see this as a cheap way to buy a green image,' says Milton Freeman, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta, Canada. 'Who could possibly be against a whale sanctuary?' Such attitudes infuriate Japan and Norway, which stress that the charter of the commission requires it to base decisions on scientific grounds, and regulate whaling so as to provide for 'the optimum utilisation of the whale resources'. They say there is no scientific basis for a comprehensive sanctuary, since endangered whales such as the blue whale, are already protected, and will continue to be protected whatever happens to the minkes. Having lost the battle over the sanctuary, Japan and Norway are pushing to replace the moratorium with catch quotas for minkes, the only whale species not endangered. Quotas would allow the Japanese to hunt on a limited scale for minke whales off its own coast, and take political pressure off Norway for resuming whaling unilaterally in the north-east Atlantic. They are seeking support from the commission, whose scientific committee has developed a mathematical model, known as the Revised Management Programme, to calculate how many whales of a species can be caught in a year without threatening survival. But the commission is in no hurry to implement the model, and the non-whaling countries would like to avoid a politically sensitive vote on the moratorium. The stalling game was given a boost by reports this year that the former Soviet Union under-reported killings of blue and other endangered whales. One ship caught 7,207 humpback whales and 1,433 blue whales during a period of the 1960s, and not 152 and 156 as reported, according to Alexei Yablokov, President Boris Yeltsin's adviser on ecology. Environmentalists said proof of Soviet misreporting would reduce any catch quotas agreed - although the commission has said its impact would be minimal. More important, environmentalists argue that observation and monitoring of catches has to be tight to prevent further cheating. With one minke whale worth up to Dollars 50,000, the temptation to misreport is considerable. As well as doubting official reports of Soviet kills, scientists have also begun to question estimates of stocks. The Norwegians reckon there are 87,000 minke whales in the north-east Atlantic, giving a catch quota of 290, according to the model. Dr Justin Cooke, a scientific consultant who helped develop the commission's mathematical model, reckons they are 53,000 minkes, which would give a quota of just one minke a year. Anti-whaling nations say that debates such as these could hold up the implementation of a quota scheme for off-shore hunting forever. Even if there is acceptance of the numbers, there is the problem of how whales are killed. The UK objects to whale hunting because of the slow and painful death of a harpooned whale. As a European commissioner put it: 'The point about whales is you get an enormous response - we received 60,000 postcards backing the sanctuary.' The fact that whale meat is regarded as a delicacy in Japan does not seem to matter.
19941121000000000	FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Rare species. It is possible that, within years, tigers could become extinct. The conference to update the Cites convention on endangered species, which concluded this weekend in Florida, made that clear. Would extinction matter? On one view, it might not: the loss would pose no immediate threat to human health or wealth. But on several counts, it is worth putting effort into saving rare species. In western eyes, tigers, elephants, whales and the like are romantic beasts, whose existence is valued even by those who never see a live specimen. For local communities, the animals can add greatly to tourism revenues. For all countries, the animals represent a pool of genes which has potential value. What is the best means of saving these species? The threats they face are poachers who want to sell tusks, hides and meat for profit, farmers who resent the damage they do, and the steady encroachment of human societies into wild habitats. The essence of the task is to give people an economic incentive to keep the animals' numbers at sustainable levels. But there are two particular problems. One is that, as some east and central African countries have found, the benefits of the live animals, through tourism, generally go to the government and companies, while the value of dead animals is received by poachers and farmers. Governments have found it hard to redistribute the benefits of tourism at a local level. Second, demand for products such as rhino horn, driven largely by Asian markets, has not yet been checked by rising prices. Given the disparity between Asian wealth and African poverty, it is possible that species would be extinct before prices rose by enough to choke demand. One solution is simply to improve enforcement of national rules against killing animals. South Africa, which devotes considerable resources to protecting its wildlife, has found numbers of elephant and white rhino growing rapidly, even though it allows limited domestic trade in ivory. But that requires funds which are beyond the resources of poorer countries. One of the best arguments for maintaining an international ban against trade in products of endangered species is that it makes guarding the animals easier and cheaper even for the poorest states. The Worldwide Fund for Nature estimates that the budgets for protecting elephants have dropped by nearly 90 per cent in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania since the worldwide ban on ivory trade in 1989 A third device is to reduce demand for the products. Environmental groups argue that since the start of the ivory ban, the price of ivory has fallen - where it can be obtained - while the price of rhino horn has increased. That is, they say, partly because the main markets for ivory were in western countries which have enforced tough import controls on ivory. Meanwhile, western public opinion has turned against ivory, There is no single solution to the problem of supporting rare species. But the Cites conference was right to uphold the ban on elephant and white rhino products, as one of several mechanisms. The next useful step would be to increase pressure on those governments which have so far taken a relaxed attitude towards import of banned products.
19890115000000000	ELEPHANT'S UNDERWATER COUSIN TO BE PROTECTED; IVORY COAST PLANS RESERVE FOR MANATEE. Plans are under way to create the first reserve in Africa for the manatee, the 1-ton, 10-foot-long underwater cousin of the elephant. The manatees live in lagoons, rivers and coastal areas from Senegal to Angola. The reserve, on an inlet of the Bandama River near Abidjan, could be established as soon as March, according to Gbande Die, director of the adjacent Azagny National Park. "This will be the first protected zone for manatees in Africa," Die said in an interview. No one knows precisely how many manatees, also known as sea cows, there are in Abidjan, whose oceanfront lagoons make ideal habitats, but officials say the population is dwindling and estimate their numbers in the hundreds rather than thousands. "When we ask the peasants, they tell us they used to see lots of manatees and now they don't," Die said. The reserve will allow scientists to study manatees, which are found in Florida, the West Indies, the Amazon basin and West Africa, and whose behavior is little known. The experts will also determine how best to protect the animals, which are hunted for their beef-like flesh. Manatees are mammals and had a common ancestor with the elephant 75 million years ago. They have been a protected species since this former French colony became independent in 1960, but that has not stopped fishermen from poaching them. "It's hard to enforce because the law is just a piece of paper," Die said. "And it's not just manatees, it's virtually all wild animals in Ivory Coast that suffer." Much of the impetus for creating the reserve and protecting manatees arises from work here by James Powell, 34, an American naturalist from Wildlife Conservation International, an arm of the New York Zoological Society. "We should be as concerned about the manatees as we are about the rhinoceros," Powell said recently. "Manatees are big, impressive and unique. There is nothing else like them." He said that manatees, whose night-time squeals are believed to have sparked mermaid myths and who are associated in West Africa with a spirit called "Mamie Wata," are timid and gentle. The West African manatee, which has a wide muzzle and a long, bulbous trunk with two side flippers, looks a bit like a toothless walrus or a sea lion. "They are extremely strong but they don't seem to have an aggressive bone in their bodies," said Powell, who has trapped 18 manatees to fit them with radio transmitters so he can track their movements. He was able to work with them without tranquilizing them. He said that visitors have flocked to see a baby manatee he raised in a pen near a popular beach resort, but the animal died several months ago. He doubted that the dark-gray manatees, which are almost impossible to see in the murky lagoons, could become a tourist attraction, as they have in Florida. But Powell thinks man and manatee could learn to live side by side. "They have an important role in the estuarine environment," he said. "They are the only large herbivores, so they eat off the unwanted vegetation." He also said that if hunting were regulated manatees could provide an important source of protein. Powell and officials of Ivory Coast's Ministry of Water and Forests said the key to saving the manatee is learning more about them and educating fishermen about the perils of poaching. Kouadio Akoi, an Education Ministry officer who works with Powell, said that it is hard to persuade people to give up a source of food but that it can be done. "The fishermen tell us, 'First you say don't kill the tortoise, then you say don't kill the manatee -- what are we going to eat?' "But the disappearance of an animal would be a loss to everybody. We have a heritage we have to leave to our children."
19900218000000000	NATURE RESERVE PROPOSED FOR TIBET PLAIN. A cold, wind-swept plain in Tibet populated with scores of birds, plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth has been proposed as the world's largest nature reserve. The Chang Tang Reserve, named from the Tibetan words for "northern plain," would encompass an area the size of California. The proposed territory covers one-sixth of the Tibet Autonomous Region and adjoining parts of the Chinese provinces of Qinghai and Xinjiang, said George Schaller, an American biologist who has explored the region and helped negotiate an agreement signed just days ago. "It's one of the last, almost unexplored places on the face of the Earth," said Schaller, of Wildlife Conservation International in New York. "It survives intact almost as it was 100 years ago." Schaller, one of the world's leading wildlife biologists, has done pioneering studies on gorillas, pandas, snow leopards and other endangered animals. He is one of the very few Westerners to have entered the Chang Tang region. Few local people have been there, either. Despite its size, it has a human population of no more than several hundred wandering herdsmen who live there for only a few months each year. When he returned from Chang Tang in late January, he brought with him an agreement with the Tibetan Environmental Protection Agency that outlines the steps to be taken to establish the reserve. An area of 100,000 square miles, about the size of Colorado, will be set aside in Tibet. The Tibetan EPA will coordinate the effort, with funds from Wildlife Conservation International and Tibetan and national agencies. Proposed additions in adjoining provinces would bring the size of the reserve to about 150,000 square miles, an area just under the size of California. "We want to, in the next few years, find out what's there and the areas of particular importance," Schaller said. He plans to return in July. The research will be conducted with the Tibet Institute of Plateau Biology. The agreement calls the area "a unique animal and plant community which includes such spectacular creatures as wild yak, Tibetan wild ass, Tibetan wild sheep, Tibetan gazelle, Tibetan antelope and Tibetan brown bear, all of which occur only on the Tibetan plateau." When asked to describe the region, he paused, searching for comparisons to convey the vastness and austere beauty of an area unlike any other. It has "the aura of the Serengeti" in East Africa, he said. "You travel and travel toward a distant horizon, and the world seems to expand in front of you." The reserve is a high-altitude steppe at an elevation of about 3 miles. It is covered with scrub grasses no more than 6 inches high, lakes too salty to drink from, and jagged, inhospitable mountains. Winter temperatures can drop to 40 or 50 degrees below zero. Snow can fall any day of the year. "And the winds," Schaller said. "Oh, how the winds can howl across there." Four hundred species of plants have been found on the plateau, along with 60 species of birds. Wild yak gather in herds of 100 or 150. "It's a real desert area, but it has oases around which animals congregate" by the thousands, he said. Access to the reserve is normally by way of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, a week's drive south of the proposed reserve. "I've gone in from the north by camel caravan, but you cross such desolate country, it's difficult," Schaller said. The trip from Lhasa isn't a simple excursion either. "You need two cars and a truck to carry gas," he said. Because of the need to carry gas, expeditions normally last no more than three months, he said. "My preference would be to just have a herd of yak animals and live in there for a few years," he said. "But politically that's not feasible." Schaller is willing, but "most of the local people have families and they don't want to be out," he said. In an area so remote, is the establishment of a nature reserve really necessary? "There is no such thing as a remote area anymore," Schaller said. "It's known there are minerals there. Near there oil has been discovered."
19900422000000000	GIANT PANDAS THREATENED BY INBREEDING. The recent discovery of a way to speed up bamboo flowering, hailed as the salvation of the giant panda, was a waste of effort, according to a Chinese expert who says inbreeding could be the end of the endangered animals. Indian researchers announced in March that they had developed a revolutionary process to cause bamboo, the panda's only food source, to flower and produce seeds decades earlier than its normal life cycle. Normally, bamboo flowers only once in its lifetime, after growing from 12 to 120 years. The flowering takes place in an entire grove and, when it is over, the whole grove dies. In 1983, some Chinese scientists raised the alarm that pandas were in imminent danger of starvation after a large grove of arrow bamboo flowered and died in the Wolong panda reserve in Sichuan province, in China's southwest. Wolong is one of six panda reserves, holding about 400 of the world's estimated 1,500 pandas living in the wild -- all in China. Western scientists had cheered the speedier regeneration of bamboo forests as spelling salvation for the pandas. But Pan Wenshi of Beijing University, one of the world's foremost authorities on pandas, said the animals were never in danger of starving. "There has never been a bamboo shortage for the pandas," Pan said. "Even if one species flowered and died, the pandas always had plenty of other species they could eat. "The development of the speedier bamboo growth process was a waste of time and effort," the biologist said. An official of the Forestry Ministry, responsible for protecting pandas, said he believed the animals would have to migrate to find food when an entire grove of bamboo died. "But I do not think the food situation is dire," the official said. He could not comment on the newly discovered bamboo growing process. Pan said that not only was the new process unnecessary to the pandas' survival, it went against nature. "When a bamboo forest dies, other plants can grow in their stead. That is the natural way, the way it should be." Pandas, which in prehistoric times ranged virtually across China from Beijing to China's extreme south, have shrunk in numbers at the approach of man. "Man is crowding the pandas out," said the Forestry Ministry official. The pandas' main sanctuary, Sichuan, is China's most populous province, with 100 million people. Even under optimum conditions, the animals have an uphill battle to survive. Their life span is only 12 years, and their reproductive period is brief. Zoologists say a giant panda couple produce on average only 0.6 offspring. Poaching and pollution have taken their toll on the bear-like black-and-white creatures. But Pan contends that the biggest enemy of the panda, worse than man, is inbreeding. There are only small concentrations of pandas in each of the six reserves, and even smaller numbers are of breeding age. "We're seeing a very small gene pool, with weak panda babies being born -- many of whom eventually die," Pan said. Pan and other researchers want to try to move male pandas around from one region to another to widen the gene pool and ensure stronger panda offspring. "If we don't do anything, at this rate there could be no more pandas in another 30 years," he said.
19890508000000000	PUBLIC BACKS NOTED PALEONTOLOGIST LEAKEY; RIVALRIES OVER WILDLIFE POACHING GRIP KENYA. This is what happened after Richard E. Leakey, world-renowned paleontologist, author and conservationist, head of the Kenya National Museums for 20 years, decided to speak out on the issue of wildlife poaching in the country's national parks: Leakey's reputation as a scientist and museum administrator was harshly attacked in the local press. The government reorganized the museum board behind his back, prompting him to submit his resignation. Despite being a native Kenyan and a citizen, whose younger brother serves in the Kenyan Parliament and as deputy tourism minister, Leakey was derided by one government minister as a "cheeky white" who felt that black Africans could not manage their own affairs. But in the fullness of time, Leakey's reputation and career have recovered. Soon after his resignation, a public uproar forced the government to restore the old museum board, and he withdrew his resignation. More recently, Leakey became head of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and Management, succeeding one of his critics. For all of that, his experiences underscore one thing: wildlife conservation in Kenya is sensitive business.  Conservation Rivalries Few events have laid open the rivalries between conservationists and bureaucrats -- and among the conservationists themselves -- as a scandal here over poaching and Leakey's outspokenness on the subject. How Kenya undertakes to protect its valued wildlife has long been a tender issue, because there is little any developing country can do to combat a gang of determined poachers. Many people here feel that the only solution is to "privatize" wildlife preserves, by establishing quasi-private companies to run existing preserves or otherwise placing them in private hands that can afford to safeguard their perimeters. But Kenyan officials are particularly sensitive to criticism, partly because they fear the impact that negative publicity might have on the country's significant tourist trade. "After all, most of us want to remain in the country," remarked one leading local zoologist, who was reluctant to discuss the issue. With a multiplicity of international and local wildlife clubs and funds and societies representing a variety of interests and philosophies, Kenyan conservationists, like keepers of the flame anywhere, often spend as much time sorting out their own differences as they do fighting a common foe. "Oh, yes," says Imre Loefler, a local surgeon and prominent conservationist, "there are enormous disagreements in the conservation community. This community has various traits and prejudices. At one extreme is the most bigoted right wing -- strictly anti-humans -- and at the other are those only interested in a few species. They're generally employed in the tourist industry." In few other places, moreover, are the conflicts between the needs of wildlife protection and those of the human population so sharply etched as in Kenya. Wildlife is Kenya's greatest tourist draw, and tourism its third-largest foreign exchange earner: The 700,000 visitors expected this year will leave behind well over $350 million in foreign currency. With coffee and tea prices locked in a long slump, tourism may be Kenya's only growth industry.  Competing With Humans Yet Kenya's elephants, rhinos, lions and antelope occupy land that comes at an increasing premium and for which they must compete ever more aggressively with the country's human population, which is growing faster than that of any other nation. In Narok, a farm district next to Masai Mara National Park, one of Kenya's most popular game reserves, a herd of elephants not long ago invaded a plantation of bananas and vegetables; in their haste to reach the food, they trampled a woman to death. In Tana River district, which includes part of Tsavo East Game Reserve, 88 people have been killed by animals since 1980, according to the Department of Tourism and Wildlife. "With growing population pressures, one has to show the politicians that setting aside preserves is economically productive, whether that involves tourism, hunting or exploitation" such as harvesting ivory, Loefler says. "You can't tell people anymore that we're just going to do this for sentimental reasons." Adding to the underlying tension is a racial element: The wildlife conservation community here largely comprises white expatriate Europeans and Americans, some of whom may not be fully sensitive to the competing interests of a poor and developing land. What set all this tinder aflame was an apparent surge of poaching late last year in Kenya's national parks. Tourists began returning from safaris in the parks, not with tales of bongo on the hoof and lions at repose yawning in the grass and trees, but of mountains of elephant carcasses, with trunks and tusks ghoulishly lopped off. Reports reached Nairobi of poaching gangs armed with automatic weapons engaging park rangers in lengthy shoot-outs. In November, Perez Olindo, Leakey's predecessor as director of Wildlife and Conservation Management, detailed the six-month war's casualties: six game rangers killed, nine wounded. In the longer term, Olindo said, poaching had reduced Kenya's elephant population in 13 years from 140,000 to 22,000. Other unofficial estimates placed the elephant population as low as 16,000. It was into this ferment that Leakey jumped with both feet last fall. Just after Tourism and Wildlife Minister George Muhoho called a news conference to pledge a redoubled government anti-poaching effort, Leakey called his own conference as chairman of the East African Wildlife Society. Calling poaching "a growing national crisis" and "economic sabotage," he labeled the government's approach toward wildlife protection "lip service" and charged that high officials of the wildlife department itself were participating in poaching. The remarks by Leakey, one of the few Kenyans of his stature to speak out, brought the poaching issue to the forefront of national and international attention. The elder son of the late Louis Leakey, whose work at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania was critical in the study of early man, Leakey has made many important discoveries himself. His directorship of the national museums is widely regarded as having given those institutions a preeminent position in study of prehistory.  Family's Prominent Role Finally, there could be few white families who have played as prominent a role as natives and citizens in Kenya's post-independence period as have the Leakeys. Muhoho at first replied with what Kenya's leading newspaper, the Daily Nation, later disapprovingly termed a "contentious response": He called Leakey a "cheeky white." Yet, it was not only Kenyan officials who felt Leakey had shot from the hip. "There's no question whatsoever that he was doing a bit of grandstanding," said David Western, chairman of the governing council of the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya. In any event, the wildlife rangers temporarily recovered some of their morale. The government staffed the parks with a detachment of its paramilitary General Services Unit,  Mounds of Carcasses Nevertheless, in succeeding months, it has become clear that the tide of poaching in the national parks, particularly of elephants, has not appreciably been stemmed. Mounds of carcasses still appear, and public concern over the situation has not abated. Leakey's outburst may finally have borne its most important fruit last month when he got a chance to take full charge of correcting the ills he has complained about. The government appointed him to replace Olindo as the man directly responsible for protecting Kenya's wildlife.
19890513000000000	AN URGE TO BURN; MADAGASCAR: RARE ISLAND UP IN SMOKE. Madagascar is burning. The evidence is everywhere: in the haze of smoke that drapes itself into the steep dales of the capital, Antananarivo, in the evening; in acres of hillside blackened with fire that line the road on the three-hour drive from there to this forest glen near the east coast, leaving nothing but a stubble of tree stumps. It is visible in the appearance from the air of the great island's central highlands, its once-deep forests burned away, leaving only a threadbare coverlet of green, as thin as the felt of an old billiard table, through which the rich red of Madagascar's soil bleeds. Blessed with a bounty of plant and animal life almost unique on Earth, thanks to 165 million years of geographical isolation from the African mainland, Madagascar is cursed with a human population of pyromaniacs.  Centuries-Old Habit The result of their fires is that this fourth-largest island in the world is also the most heavily eroded. Compounded by a population explosion, the residents' centuries-old habit of slash-and-burn agriculture today menaces the island's future. The story is told here of a visiting Soviet cosmonaut who told his hosts that their island is the only land mass he could never fail to identify from space. It is always surrounded by a halo of bright red sea, he explained, the color of the soil relentlessly scrubbed off its denuded surface by the wind and rain. Madagascar's prized lemurs, the squirrel-tailed, dog-muzzled, monkey-like primates of which 23 species are unique to the island, have been pushed out of their accustomed habitats into progressively smaller strips of forest. Its precious rice fields, which feed the world's heaviest per capita consumers of rice, are fouled by soil eroded off the bare hills. Its best west coast port is all but useless today, so full is it of silt carried off the hills by its river.  Spreading Malnutrition As the forests dwindle and the soil is degraded, charcoal and rice alike become more expensive, and malnutrition spreads among Madagascar's children. Martin Nicoll, a World Wildlife Fund official here, observed: "Virtually everyone in Madagascar is dependent on an endangered ecosystem." That ecosystem is one of the world's wonders. The island may not have lions, elephants or giraffes, but not one of its more than 400 species of primates, rodents, carnivores and insects is seen anywhere else on the globe. About 95% of its reptile species and 46% of its birds are also unique. Its outstanding diversity and sheer strangeness often have naturalists talking of Madagascar as if it were the product of a fabulist's imagination. "Butterflies as big as birds, and birds as colorful as the rainbow" were among the wonders listed by British environmentalists Gerald and Lee Durrell in their keynote address to a 1985 scientific conference marking the start of worldwide concern over the island's environment. Mammals here have retained traits that their mainland cousins lost in prehistoric times, such as the ultrasonic alarms and signals that tenrecs -- small, burrowing insectivores -- produce by vibrating their quills.  Unusual Ecological Niches Others have filled ecological niches left vacant by the vagaries of evolution. For instance, the nocturnal aye-aye, perhaps the strangest of Madagascar's lemurs, fills the role of the rest of the world's woodpeckers by digging under tree bark for grubs with its spindly, "E.T"-like middle finger. But the Malagasy love affair with fire is increasingly at odds with this otherworldly population of animals and plants. The Malagasy burn for many reasons. They burn the hillsides to clear land for a form of rice culture known as tavy. They burn the flatlands to bring up new shoots of grass for their cattle to graze. They burn irreplaceable forest to make charcoal. "And sometimes," said Voara Randriamasolo, director of the national zoo in Antananarivo, "when they're unhappy with the government, they burn." The fires set in pastureland eat away at the edges of the rain forest, drying them up until they flake away like the pages of a yellowing book. "The fires get out of hand because the people set them and let them burn until they just die out," said Sheila O'Connor, a Cambridge University biologist working in the south of the country. Unprotected by forest, the rolling hills of the highlands are scarred by crescent-shaped earthslides and eroded gullies, so common that the Malagasy have a word for them in their quasi-Polynesian language: lavaka.  Conservation Effort Yet for all that, Madagascar has today become the focus of one of the world's most ambitious conservation programs. Development agencies, including the U.N. Development Program and the U.S. Agency for International Development, have over the last three years made the environment their prime focus. In the same period, the government has awakened to the threat. After an international conference in 1985, the government approved a program to improve management of its 22 preserves and to add 14 sites to protect such delicate ecosystems as coral reefs and mangrove swamps. "Today, there's often no staff in some preserves, or sometimes one nominal guide, with no transport, no training," said Nicoll. With foreign help, the government is prepared to spend as much as $200,000 per year to train and equip wardens for each of 14 particularly important reserves selected for intensive management. The programs will include rural development schemes aimed at providing local farmers with alternatives to the ancient destructive practices. In some ways, Madagascar is a test of environmental preservation programs in the Third World. Where environmentalism is no luxury, such programs must have their own justification. Farmers cannot simply be instructed not to burn; they must be told how to find alternatives.  'Why Should We Stop?' "The difficulty," said Randriamasolo, "is the chiefs say, 'We've been burning for 100 years. . . . Why should we stop now?' " Complicating the process here has been a history of political, not just geographical, isolation. For 10 years beginning in 1975, the Malagasy government barred all foreign researchers from the island. When they were permitted to return, the government itself was just beginning to realize the seriousness of the decline. Even today, some Malagasy, just like many other Africans, bristle at the suggestion that foreign help is crucial to preservation of the island's ecosystem. "It must be the Malagasy themselves who take matters in hand," said Bartholom Voahita, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund's local office. "The British or Americans wouldn't allow their patrimony to be taken over by Tanzanians, would they? So, why should we let ours be taken over by them?" Yet, the pace of destruction is so great, and the rate of discovery so slow, that scientists are convinced that countless species are going extinct without ever having been known. "Since the arrival of man on the island (1,500 years ago), two species of tortoise, three of birds and 11 of lemurs have disappeared," the Durrells told the 1985 conference. At least 238 others are endangered. "I think you'd have to conclude that there have been extinctions here in the last 20 years," said George Schatz, a botanist from the Missouri Botanical Gardens in St. Louis who has been helping the government chart a proposed reserve. "Sometimes a species is localized to just the side of a hill. When the hill goes, the species goes." At the same time, new species are constantly being discovered in the island's newly explored areas. Not too long ago, botanists discovered a new palm -- not just a new species, but a new genus. It wasn't that the palm was so inconspicuous that no one noticed it before. Rather, it is a majestic tree, 100 feet high and crowned with a red crest that proclaims its presence from half a mile away. "It was in a place where people had never gotten to," said Schatz. "I know that one of every 20 plants I collect here is probably a new species," he added. "In my preserve, there might be 500 new species altogether." The decline of Madagascar's ecosystem began, if at a leisurely pace, with man's arrival from the South Pacific about 1,500 years ago. At that time, much of the island was covered with virgin rain forest. Since then, the forest has receded to a thin strip along the island's eastern coast and clumps in the isolated northern and southern tips, and the Malagasy have perfected their slash-and-burn methods of cultivation.  Population Explosion Destructive as they are, the impact of these techniques was limited when Madagascar was relatively thinly populated and the land plentiful. But in the last 20 years, the population has nearly doubled, to about 11 million from 6.2 million in 1966. The pace of destruction has grown proportionately. "The farmers might get 400 to 500 kilograms of rice per hectare the first year (of slash-and-burn cultivation)," said the World Wildlife Fund's Nicoll. "The second year, they only get half as much. The third year, they get a tremendous infestation of pests and weeds because the soil is dying. So, it's abandoned. They pull out and leave it fallow for 11 to 15 years." That's long enough for the land to recover. But the population explosion has forced the Malagasy to telescope this cycle. "There is so little land now that the cycle is three to five years," said Nicoll. "That's not enough time for anything but grass and bamboo, so the cycle spirals downhill. They go into more difficult areas -- steeper hills, poorer climates." The destruction builds geometrically. Conservationists say the government's emphasis on preservation has borne some fruit in recent times, particularly by halting the commercial exploitation of endangered forest land for timber and by controlling the poaching of lemurs. Some local people have discovered that conservation pays more directly, too, in guide fees and jobs in tourist lodges. Perhaps one of the greater successes is a small reserve known as Perinet, about 50 miles east of the capital and just outside the railroad stop of Andasibe. Tree cutting and lemur hunting have all but ceased in the reserve, said Maurice Bedo, a young guide who explained that he grew up inside the forest of Perinet. "I spent all my childhood hours in here because I love nature," he said. Being a guide is so lucrative here that Maurice's brother, Joseph, recently gave up on his college preparation because no job he could aspire to with a college education would pay more than he gets now. In his patched blue jogging suit, Maurice leads a troop of researchers deep into the woods. Tree roots interlock in a sort of ladder up the steep hillsides. He stops frequently to point out the peculiar characteristics of the plants lining the path. This one is an anodyne for a scorpion bite, he explains, showing how one crumples the leaf and rubs the moisture on the skin. Perinet is dedicated to the preservation of Madagascar's largest lemur, the indri, a tailless brown-and-white teddy bear of a primate. The indri's most appreciated feature is its call. "A Callas among the lemurs," is the description of one naturalist, "who composes and performs its own operas." Presently, Maurice's brother, Joseph, emerges from a thicket with the news he has tracked down an indri family of five. Suddenly, they are spotted flinging themselves, limbs outstretched, across the wedge of sunlight coming through the treetops. Two can be seen folded together in the crook of a tree. Silence. Then with the abruptness of a foghorn comes a symphony of pentatonic sound, a song of greeting, alarm or awakening in five harmonizing pitches. The calls continue for perhaps five minutes. Then they end as suddenly as they began. All over Madagasgar, the Malagasy and foreign visitors alike have been discovering those hitherto-hidden qualities of the island's wildlife. But resistance to changing the old ways still thrives. Cambridge University's O'Connor was confronted by resistance just last year, after she and some colleagues emerged in their Land Rover from the depths of a forest preserve they were helping to chart. "We came across a huge plot on fire," she recalled. "Later, one of the villagers told us they had done it to display annoyance at our not having made contact with them before going into the forest. It may or may not have been true, but they never did cultivate it."
19890608000000000	P.M. BRIEFING; BAN ON SEALSKIN IMPORTS EXTENDED. The European Community today imposed a permanent ban on baby sealskin imports. The decision, announced at a meeting of EC environment ministers in Luxembourg, delighted a crowd of about 100 animal welfare demonstrators from all over the 12-nation community. "We're terribly happy. It's the best we could have hoped for," said Enid Homard of Britain, who belongs to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. A six-year EC import ban on the skins of harp and hooded seal pups, due to expire Oct. 1, was made permanent to help protect the species from extinction. The skins are sold as luxury fur goods in the West.
19890609000000000	P. M. BRIEFING; EC AGREES TO BAN IVORY IMPORT. The 12 European Community states agreed in principle today to ban the import of ivory which threatens the African elephant with extinction, diplomats said. Until a community ban on raw and worked ivory is completed, environment ministers may take emergency action against imports in their own countries. Britain, which initiated the EC action, has decided on an immediate ban, the diplomats said. African elephants, slaughtered by poachers for their ivory tusks, have dwindled to 625,000 today from 1.3 million in 1979. The EC's executive Commission will draw up proposals for a ban that could be adopted by the end of June. The EC also plans to back a call for a global ban at a meeting of 102 nations in Switzerland in October.
19900805000000000	CHINA PURSUES 'RENT-A-PANDA' DIPLOMACY. Despite appeals by environmentalists, China is pressing ahead with its "rent-a-panda" diplomacy by sending the endangered animals to zoos around the world. Two giant pandas will be flown to Singapore in October and placed on display for three months. China Wildlife Conservation Assn. official Song Huigang defended the policy and angrily denounced attempts by the World Wide Fund for Nature to stop the practice. Fewer than 1,000 pandas are believed to survive in China, according to a recent estimate by a leading Chinese zoologist who said the population is being ravaged by illegal hunting and a deteriorating environment. To protect the bearlike creatures from extinction China stopped giving pandas to other countries in 1985, after donating more than 20 to foreign zoos. But the "rent-a-panda" business has never ceased and earns valuable hard currency for China. A 100-day loan of an animal costs more than $400,000, foreign sources said. "There's no question of a price," said a second official of the Chinese conservation association. "But we welcome a donation." China said the money is spent protecting pandas. When Australia rented two pandas in 1988 after Prime Minister Bob Hawke cuddled one in a Chinese zoo, the "donation" amounted to several hundred thousand dollars. "There's no such thing as a free panda," a Western diplomat said. The World Wide Fund for Nature, which has adopted the panda as its symbol, is opposed to flying pandas around the world because they are an endangered species. "They have no right to interfere in China's affairs," Song said. "They use our panda as their emblem and have raised $20 million," he said. "But only $2 million of the money is put to use in China's panda rescue efforts." China said large sums have been spent on saving the animals, which are found only in China, and smugglers and hunters caught trading in their have been executed.
19900917000000000	SCIENCE / MEDICINE; WHOOPING CRANES STRETCHING OUT; BREEDING: ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ENDANGERED FAMILY OF BIRDS IS COMING BACK FROM BRINK OF EXTINCTION. AVICULTURISTS GO TO ANY LENGTHS, INCLUDING PERFORMING THE RITUAL MATING DANCE, TO SAVE THE SPECIES.. Into the west-blowing wind, Marianne Wellington sprints uphill, flapping her arms up and down. She is calling, "Prrrr! Prrrrrr!" rolling the r's in a high-pitched trill. Behind her follow eight cinnamon-brown chicks on two-foot-long pinkish legs, leaping and flapping. From eggs laid in the wild in Northwest Territories, Canada, and hatched in captivity in Wisconsin, the chicks, ranging in age from 7 to 9 weeks, are just discovering what their newly feathered wings are for. Crane mothering is tiring. "I can only take so much running and then I have to rest," said Wellington. At least she knows her colleagues will not laugh at her. At various times, many of them have run around wearing crane costumes and frog-walked backward while operating a crane puppet. For here at the International Crane Foundation, no challenge is too great -- nor any effort too silly looking to try -- when it comes to breeding and raising cranes, one of the world's most endangered family of birds. Today at the facility, the endangered whooping crane is the beneficiary of one of the most intensive and innovative efforts staged to protect an American species. Whooping cranes, the tallest birds in North America, once whitened the skies with their migrations. Nearly as tall as a man, with a wingspan that Icarus would envy and the voice of a siren's wail, the whooping crane is one of the most spectacular birds in North America -- and one of the rarest. There are about 235 whooping cranes left on the planet, victims of shrinking wetland habitat. All are descendants of the remnant population of 15 birds counted in 1941 at their summering grounds at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas -- a population that is now protected by U.S. and Canadian law. "The whooping crane's return from the brink of extinction is one of the most encouraging stories in conservation," said George Archibald, founder of ICF. To save the crane, aviculturists and ornithologists here have dressed up like cranes, incubated crane chicks under chickens, and treated birds with deformed legs with hydrotherapy. Archibald has even acted as surrogate mate to a captive female, performing the species' elaborate courtship dance -- and personally incubating a crane egg under his sleeping bag. Foundation staff have successfully bred 14 of the world's 15 crane species. They were the first in the world to breed the rare Siberian and hooded cranes native to Asia; the first in North America to breed Brolga cranes, native to Australia, and the first -- just last month -- to hatch a black-necked crane chick outside of its native China. Because of ICF's success, the private foundation was selected this year to receive 12 crane eggs removed from the nests of whoopers breeding in Canada's Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories. Jim Lewis, director of the National Whooping Crane Recovery Team, said that whooping cranes normally lay two eggs per nest, but only one chick typically survives the summer. Artificially incubating the eggs allows twice as many cranes to survive as would in the wild. Two months ago, they hatched out of brown-speckled, greenish eggs warmed and moistened in incubators. The whooping chicks were fed by puppets so the chicks will know they are whooping cranes and be able to select appropriate mates, said Wellington. Wearing a white-sleeved glove with a crane-faced head and scissors-like beak, crane aviculturists learn to walk backward, squatting, trying to get the uncoordinated babies to eat moistened crane chow off the red spoon protruding from the puppet's mouth. All the while, they must play a tape recording of the purring brood call of the adult female crane -- a sound solicited for the recording by stroking a captive female's back and tail, mimicking the pre-copulatory behavior of the male. "The secret to breeding these birds in captivity is a lot of tender loving care," Archibald said. For a captive female whooper named Tex, that tender loving care extended to Archibald actually becoming her mate. Tex, born at the San Antonio Zoo in 1967, had been raised in the living room of zoo director Fred Stark. The result of its craneless chickhood was a lifelong preference for people instead of whooping cranes. When it was passed on to Patuxent Wildlife Research Center near Laurel, Md., Tex was unrelentingly cold to potential mates. So the Wildlife Service gave it to Archibald in 1976, who at that time was beginning to gather crane species for breeding. To bring Tex to breeding condition required a suitable suitor, but a real crane would not do. So Archibald courted the human-imprinted crane. He moved in with it, sleeping on a cot in its pen for a month. Tex fell in love. When spring came, Archibald's attentions increased. Imitating the balletic leaping, bowing, bobbing, wing-spreading and neck-flinging of the male partner, he performed the crane courtship dance for it. To his joy, Tex responded, dancing its part. The dance, researchers believe, is a necessary step in getting the crane to ovulate. It was artificially inseminated with semen from a male whooping crane at Patuxent, and in 1982, after several failures, it laid a fertile, healthy egg. In the territory Archibald and Tex had staked out on a grassy hillside, the two gathered nesting material, foraged together, danced and co-incubated the precious egg. Archibald piled his sleeping bag on the nest and set up a card table so he could read and write while keeping the egg warm. Meanwhile, Tex went foraging. Later that season, Tex was tragically eaten by a raccoon, but the egg survived in an incubator. Gee Whiz hatched on the first of June. Today, Gee Whiz is "a great big beautiful whooping crane," Archibald said with a father's pride. Unlike its mother, Gee Whiz knows it is a crane and will be able to select and court an appropriate mate. Instilling "whooperness" in the cranes is a science of its own, as Patuxent staff discovered when it began its breeding program in 1973. Until last fall, Patuxent had the only captive breeding flock of whoopers in the nation; last year, 22 birds -- half of the Maryland flock -- were moved to Baraboo, to protect the captives from a single disaster or disease wiping out the population. These chicks will stay at ICF as breeding stock, but their offspring are slated for release in Florida in 1992, forming a new, non-migratory flock of birds where a vanished flock once wintered. Because today's chicks are tomorrow's breeders, these cranes are taught to tolerate, not fear, their keepers. For others slated for release into the wild, different protocols are used. That is where the crane costumes come in. Wild cranes are justifiably afraid of humans, who may illegally hunt them or disturb their nests. To make sure the group to be released retains that healthy fear, ICF ethologist Robert Horwich makes sure he is not mistaken for a human. He dresses up his full body in the garb of a crane. The costume he designed looks like something you might see in a Halloween parade -- one sleeve ends with a puppet head, the other is covered in cloth feathers. Horwich's body is draped with a gray sheet, and his face is covered with an opaque black patch to mimic the sandhill's markings. Horwich worked with five sandhills until they were fledglings, 10 weeks old, and outfitted with radio collars for tracking. They were moved to Necedah National Wildlife Refuge, 55 miles north of the foundation's headquarters, where they joined a wild group and migrated south to winter in Florida. "It makes me feel we've done the right thing, to release them and have them join their own kind," Horwich said. Since 1985, his method has been successfully tried on three other captive-hatched species slated for release: red-crowned cranes, Siberian cranes and Eastern Sarus cranes. As less-developed countries begin their captive-breeding programs, the foundation offers expertise and advice. Because countries such as China are less likely to have newfangled incubators on hand, ICF is experimenting with a low-tech solution: chickens. Cochin hens will happily incubate crane eggs, and this year's experiments with red-crowned, white-naped and sandhill cranes will determine if the method works. For foreign conservationists, the whooping crane's comeback, and ICF's success, are welcome models. "The whooper is like the legendary phoenix bird that rose from the ashes," said Archibald. "Not all endangered species are doomed."
19900923000000000	PYRENEES DEVELOPERS CAUGHT IN A BUZZ SAW OVER ALL-BUT-INVISIBLE BEARS; ENDANGERED SPECIES: ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY RARE COLONY COULD BE EXTINCT WITHIN 20 YEARS UNLESS STRICT PROTECTION GUIDELINES ARE ADOPTED AND OBEYED.. This is the story of a dozen bears with pretty names like Papillon, Zoe, Dominique and Camille, who have become the center of one of Europe's fiercest environmental debates. It also concerns Jojo, a millionaire loner, who is the best-known animal in the Pyrenees. Jojo is tame and the rest are wild. Fifteen thousand people a year visit the village of Borce, France, under snow-speckled mountains to see Jojo in his cage and be told how he was rescued as an abandoned cub by schoolchildren 19 years ago. He is soon to be given a 1.5 million reserve of his own and his first mate. One of the reasons for spoiling him is that he justifies the logo of the Aspe Valley, the entrance to the Pyrenees National Park. On tourist brochures, a cuddly teddy clutches a flower, giving the impression that bears are as common as those in America's Yellowstone and as much loved. Both themes are wrong. Bears are all but invisible while local people fear that campaigns on their behalf will hold up road, ski station and other building plans that might save a dying valley populated by dairy farmers who have hated bears for centuries. The Council of Europe's environmentalists say the bears could be extinct within 20 years unless strict protection guidelines are obeyed. The head of the national park's scientific committee, Michel Clin, a Bordeaux geological professor, agreed with this view. He resigned in anger in July, saying that the valley's 13 local councils were going ahead with development plans that will destroy one of Europe's last bear colonies. Visitors to the Pyrenees Park might think that this has already happened. A game warden has just retired after 45 years' service without ever sighting the animal. Villagers at Urdos or Accous tell thrilling stories of bears attacking the parish priest's beehive or terrorizing isolated shepherds but the tales date back 10 years or more. Only men of faith see the bears. A local photographer, Gerard Lopez, camped out every week for six years before he got his picture. But the most persistent bear-tracker is Jean-Jacques Camarra, an official of the National Hunting Office who has identified and named at least a dozen bears although sometimes the only clue was a footprint or a piece of fur. His whole life is devoted to protecting the animals and he spends seven or eight hours a day walking from forest to forest. He has seen bears only 12 times in 10 years -- including cubs playing with butterflies -- and has just written a book called "L'Ours Brun" in which he reveals their names for the first time. In it, he sets out the arguments of environmental lobbies, backed by the minister, Brice Lalonde, who believes the bears must have 250,000 acres of what he calls "tranquility space" to survive beyond 2010. The enormous popularity of Jean-Jacques Annaud's film, "The Bear," which was pre-released here to a background of violent controversy, has done much to aid his cause. "It is not just an ecological argument" he said. "The presence of bears and their increase could contribute to bringing back prosperity to the region". This is a minority view in a valley of 3,000 people that has lost 75% of its population in 90 years. The bear is a natural enemy of high altitude sheep and cattle farmers. Last year there were 39 cases of bear attacks on sheep, but shepherds say there were many unproved cases where animals died of fright. Turn of the century photographs of villagers tormenting or maltreating 10-foot-high bears show how deep the resentment goes. In 1982, two bears were shot dead despite fierce protection measures in which large areas are inaccessible to local communities. One village received compensation of 40,000 francs last year because a forest was put out of bounds so that bears would not be disturbed by timber work. Some of the money was spent on flying in food, including half a cow, by helicopter in an attempt to lure the animals away. Helicopters are also used to fly shepherds' supplies to high mountain pastures so as not to disturb bear trails. "We can't collect wood, we can't graze sheep and we can't collect berries because of those animals" an irritated farmer said. "Bears, bears . . . they always come first." According to Jacques Capdeville, a nature lover who runs the equivalent of a public works cooperative for the 13 village councils, every argument over saving bears is full of contradictions. "There were more bears in the valley when there were more people" he said, implicitly casting doubt over the immense zone of tranquility that would throw centuries of farming tradition into disarray. "In the adjoining Ariege department bears have disappeared at the same time as the population has drifted away, leaving the area like a desert. Bears appear to thrive in the proximity of humans and it's not surprising if local people feel they should be left to sort this out by themselves without pressure from outside". In the Aspe Valley with its medieval stone villages, the rural drift has been temporarily stopped but new job opportunities are still desperately needed to persuade young people to stay. Local councilors have approved a 25-million franc European Community road-widening scheme, a new road tunnel alongside the park and long-distance skiing facilities and other developments to encourage tourism. The environmental lobby, backed by radicals who have destroyed construction equipment, say that the bears will run away in fright or just lie down and die if the work starts. But while Zoe, Dominique and Camille play hide and seek, Jojo looks smugger than ever in his cage at Borce. The same farmers who hate the wild bears go sloppy when they talk of the local orphan brought down from the mountains in a haversack. He will be more than ever the center of interest in his own 10-acre reserve from December, which expects to receive 50,000 visitors a year. At 20, he will at last be given a mate. Because of the shortage of candidates in the Aspe Valley, his mate will come from a Paris zoo.
19901020000000000	COLUMN ONE; A WILDLIFE SMUGGLER'S PARADISE; ILLICIT TRADING IN ENDANGERED SPECIES FLOURISHES IN THAILAND. LEGAL LOOPHOLES AND CORRUPTION MAKE IT HARD TO STOP.. When security guards passed the suitcase on Thai International's Sunday night flight to Paris through a routine X-ray check, they were astounded to see the images of three tiny bodies moving inside. When the suitcase was opened, customs officials found three rare apes known as gibbons, renowned for their eerie resemblance to small humans. The gibbons had been wedged into a cardboard box so that they could barely move, then wrapped in a towel and stuffed into the suitcase for the 13-hour flight to France. The smuggling incident at Bangkok's Don Muang Airport on Oct. 7 provided fresh evidence that Thailand remains a wildlife supermarket, the world center for an illicit trade in endangered species of animals ranging from the orangutans of Indonesia to the crocodile-like caimans of South America. In addition to serving as an international transit center to "launder" illegally obtained wildlife, Bangkok is home to dealers who now control a growing trade in wildlife poached in the countries of Indochina -- Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. One enterprising Bangkok dealer has even created a fictitious zoo using a post office box in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, giving the impression of legality to help market everything from parrots to camels. "Principally because of its poor enforcement (of international regulations), Thailand has now taken over from Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore as the favored destination in Asia of much illegal wildlife trade," said a recent report by the World Wide Fund for Nature. "It is regularly used as a laundering point for wildlife to enter Europe and other countries in Asia." There is a huge demand in America for rare parrots and dangerous snakes. Collectors in Japan and elsewhere in Asia seek rare monkeys, such as Vietnam's douc langur, as exotic pets. Foreign and Thai conservationists blame the problem largely on a lack of Thai laws to protect animals that are not native to Thailand. Although the Thai government ratified the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which sharply restricts imports and exports of animals at risk of extinction, it has never adopted laws to provide enforcement. Five attempts by the Wildlife Department to get legislation passed by Parliament have failed. Illegally imported animals are "laundered," or made to appear legal, in several ways. The simplest is to obtain forged documents certifying that the animals can be legally exported, such as for research purposes. Another method used by dealers is to take animals to the Laotian capital of Vientiane, just across the Thai border, obtain legal documents from the Laotian government, which has not signed the endangered species pact, and then import them back into Thailand legally. The same is true of Cambodia. One other popular method of laundering, according to wildlife experts, is to describe animals being shipped out as something different than what they are. Dealers will obtain clearance for a shipment of parakeets, for example, and then ship rare parrots. One dealer shipped rare birds to the United States marked "Danger: Spitting Cobras," but the package was nonetheless opened by an intrepid U.S. Customs agent. Even with native species, the Thai government has a spotty record of enforcement. According to Boonlerd Angsirijinda, chief wildlife enforcement officer in the Forestry Department, customs officials at the airport took no action against the passenger who was attempting to smuggle out the three gibbons, which are now suffering from double pneumonia. "If you confess, there is no penalty," Boonlerd said of tourists caught at the airport. "You have to give up the animals, but you can leave the country." Similarly, traders caught in Thailand by the police routinely receive suspended jail sentences. Because of the influx of foreign tourists in recent years, traders have begun using airports at Chiang Mai in the north and Phuket in the south to smuggle animals out of Thailand because customs officials there are unfamiliar with the complicated conservation laws. The Wildlife Department also has no facilities to care for seized animals, so they are often at risk of dying even if they are rescued. Two British women living in Thailand, Leonie Vejjajiva and Margaret Himathongkom, have started private menageries to care for recovered animals, including the three gibbons. Bangkok's tourist shops are filled with items carved from ivory. Shop owners assert that the ivory is from Africa, where exporting ivory is prohibited. But Thailand does not observe the ban and, under Thai law, African ivory is legal. Still, there are no checks to determine whether the ivory has actually come from Africa or from Thai elephants, which are protected by law. Last month, Sueb Nakhasathien, head of one of Thailand's largest wildlife sanctuaries, committed suicide to draw attention to the widespread poaching of protected animals. Similarly, tourist areas are filled with shops offering reptile-skin boots at bargain prices. The boots almost certainly are made in Brazil from skins of the endangered caimans rather than of the far more expensive crocodiles raised in Thailand. But once the skins have been turned into pointed cowboy boots, few stop to ask questions. Tom Milliken, a Covina, Calif., man who works for an organization called Traffic Japan, which is attempting to restrict illegal wildlife trade in Japan, said there is an enormous market in that country. Milliken traced several shipments in 1988 in which tens of thousands of caiman skins were sent from South America through Thailand and on to Japan using forged documents obtained in Bangkok to obscure their origins. At one point, the Japanese government sent a query by telex to the Thai Wildlife Department; the reply by telex came instead from a wildlife dealer, indicating that government employees were working on both sides of the fence. "The Thai law contains a major loophole," Milliken said. "If the situation doesn't improve qualitatively, I think you'll see sanctions being imposed against Thailand." Even Pairot Suwannakorn, director general of the Forestry Department, who has been praised by foreign experts for his efforts to reform his agency, said the existing laws "are simply ridiculous. We don't have the power to arrest." He added that corruption among government officials who profit from the trade "is a big problem." As just about every tourist who has visited Bangkok knows, the city's weekend Chatuchak market is a center for the wildlife trade. During a visit in early October, a trader produced a gibbon from a hiding place and offered it for sale for 3,000 baht, about $120. Another loophole in Thai laws that benefits small dealers allows individuals to own two protected animals as pets. Thus, even if caught with two gibbons at the market, a dealer can avoid prosecution by saying they are merely pets. Dealers frequently employ children as salesmen, thus avoiding prosecution altogether. According to Boonlerd of the Forestry Department, 57 people have been arrested for wildlife trade this year and the government has confiscated 1,559 birds, 481 reptiles and 123 mammals, mostly monkeys. It also has taken possession of 10,159 illegal skins. Ironically, the wildlife trade is so open that a worldwide conference on conservation was held recently at a Bangkok hotel that advertises that it has hundreds of rare birds in cages on its grounds. The export to Thailand of many such birds is barred under the endangered-species convention. Besides the weekend market and individual vendors serving tourists, there are four major wildlife traders in Bangkok who act as conduits for shipping abroad, wildlife groups say. Many use impoverished zoos in Eastern Europe to further help "launder" the animals, obscuring their true origins, according to Thai wildlife officials. In exchange for a specimen or two of an endangered animal, the zoos provide the dealers with certificates falsely showing that other specimens of the animal were born in captivity. Under the international convention, the sale of endangered species born in captivity is legal. One of the four traders, Preecha Varavichit, who operates a company called Pimjai Birds, told the newspaper Bangkok Post recently that he paid $5,000 to the Laotian government to operate out of Vientiane, where wildlife trading is conducted at a former army camp and is apparently legal. "Laos has a lot of wildlife," he said. Preecha told the newspaper that senior Thai officials "have never questioned me, and they don't dare." He was quoted as saying that "if government officials did not give their cooperation, I would not be able to do business. Don't blame me alone. They work as a team. If they take legal action against me, I will reveal everything." Shirley McGreal, head of the International Primate Protective League in Summerville, S.C., said in a telephone interview that the flourishing trade is doubly worrying because of the destructive way in which the wildlife is collected. A baby gibbon, for example, can be taken only if the mother is killed, usually by high-powered rifle. But the subsequent fall from a tree often injures the baby as well, meaning that 20 gibbons may die for each one sold on the market. "It's very, very destructive of the species," McGreal said. "There is such terrible waste." According to McGreal and others, the animals are also shipped in horrific conditions. A gorilla sent from Africa to Bangkok via Moscow arrived frozen solid. One Japanese tourist had 11 rare monkeys jammed into a carry-on bag. When discovered by Tokyo customs, five of the monkeys had suffocated. Pisit na Patalung, head of the Wildlife Fund of Thailand, said he objects to the sheer cruelty of the animal dealers. Monkeys' teeth are pulled out with pliers or cut with clippers to make their bites harmless. Smugglers have gotten some small leopards out of Thailand by dyeing their fur black and claiming them as house cats. Rare birds are drugged and stuffed into suitcases. Perhaps the most famous case involves what has become known as the "Bangkok Six," six orangutans shipped from Singapore to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, via Bangkok last February. Singapore does not X-ray personal baggage as a security precaution, and so it is another favorite conduit for wildlife smugglers. In this case, the shipment was discovered in Bangkok because of a clerical oversight; the Soviet airline Aeroflot would not carry animals without a waybill. When the crate was opened, the six orangutans were found stuffed in straw to keep them from moving, three of them upside down. A West German national, Kurt Schafer, who works for a wildlife trader in Bangkok, was later fined about $1,000 by a Singapore court for attempting to smuggle the animals to the Belgrade Zoo in Yugoslavia. According to McGreal, the six orangutans were apparently headed for a wildlife dealer in Miami. The apes have been popular in the United States since Clint Eastwood made a series of films with them. The case of the Bangkok Six caused a furor in Thailand. Photographs appeared around the world showing the injured apes. Although shipped back to their native Indonesia, four of them have since died. Despite the outcry, a wild animal dealer in Jakarta has four orangutans awaiting shipment, according to Leonie Vejjajiva. "It's just too horrible to contemplate," she said.
19891023000000000	SCIENCE / MEDICINE; ZOO PLAYS CUPID TO MOTHER NATURE. Some might consider it arcane that tape-recorded thunderstorms act as an aphrodisiac for the Majorcan toad. But not Quentin Bloxam. Nor, one assumes, the toads. Bloxam is a senior curator at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, better known locally as, simply, the Jersey Zoo, and he's spent 25 years learning the amorous secrets of some of nature's more obscure creatures. That's because his employer is no ordinary zoo. Instead of lions, tigers and giraffes, the tenants here are Round Island boas, cheetahs, pink pigeons and partula snails. Founded 30 years ago by author and naturalist Gerald Durrell, the Jersey Zoo is a pioneer in captive breeding programs meant to preserve rare and endangered species of mammals, birds and reptiles. And it claims the most extensive collection of such species anywhere. The zoo's symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius that became extinct in the 17th Century. There's a Dodo Cafe here, a Dodo Dispatch newsletter and replicas of the strange-looking bird everywhere one gazes on the preserve. They're reminders of what could happen to 50 other endangered species that call Jersey home if it weren't for the trust and a growing network of more conventional North American, European and other zoos that now cooperate in captive breeding programs. Ideally, the goal of these programs is to rebuild the supply of a rare species to the point where it can be reintroduced into the wild. In fact, that's not practical for most, because the same elements that threatened to make them extinct in the first place still exist in their indigenous homes. There are exceptions -- such as the pink pigeon, which has been bred in captivity and reintroduced to the Maccabbe forest area of Mauritius; or the reddish-maned golden lion tamarin, raised in Jersey and several American zoos and returned recently to Brazil's Poco das Antas Biological Reserve; and Quentin Bloxam's Majorcan toads, which have been prospering with the help of his artificial rainstorms and tape-recorded thunder. It's not easy being a midwife to Mother Nature, Bloxam said. Take the case of the Round Island boa, indigenous to an island off Mauritius but now believed to be the world's rarest snake. The boa is threatened to the verge of extinction by rabbits that apparently destroy its eggs and habitat. Early explorers introduced the rabbits to provide for future shipwrecked mariners. Field workers for the trust captured 11 specimens and transported them to Jersey between 1977 and 1982. "It took us two years to perfect the management of them," said Bloxam, who is in charge of the reptile collection. "Then we had to try and get them to breed." Dietary experimentation finally worked, and in 1982 the first infant Round Island boas were hatched. They died in a matter of weeks, and it wasn't until 1985 that more came along. Bloxam and his team first had to find a substitute for the baby lizards that the tiny snakes would have eaten in the wild, and then force-feed them, a process comparable to spending 90 minutes repeatedly searching for the mouth of a wiggling shoelace. By two years ago, the Jersey staff had perfected its techniques sufficiently -- feeding time was down to 20 minutes per shoelace -- that it could afford to ship three of the rare reptiles to a Canadian zoo. But Bloxam said the snakes died at their new home. "That didn't please me too much." Now he's about to try again, loaning four snakes from his expanding collection to the Dallas zoo. But this time Bloxam has spent three weeks training a reptile keeper from the Dallas zoo, and the reptile curator is also coming for a two-day introduction to the species. "I'd like to get somebody else breeding them," said Bloxam. "I don't like the fact that we are the only ones." A nonprofit operation, the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust operates on a budget of about 1 million British pounds a year, equivalent to $1.6 million at the current rate of exchange. That supports about 1,500 individual animals, birds and reptiles kept on 25 acres of manicured parkland, as well as an ambitious educational program for local schoolchildren and visiting student conservationists. The trust's money comes from public admissions to the zoo ($5 for an adult), donations, bequests and proceeds from a gift shop and the Dodo Cafe. One of its fund-raising gimmicks is to offer its animals for adoption. A "foster parent" pays an annual fee roughly equal to the cost of feeding an animal and in return receives a small brass identifying plaque on its cage. The donor also gets a photograph of the animal and periodic news reports from the zoo on its progress and activities. Costs range from the equivalent of $800 annually for a lowland gorilla to $12 for a partula snail, from Moorea Island in French Polynesia. And the program is so popular that there is a waiting list to adopt most species. "At the moment we've only got snails available," Jersey Zoo guide coordinator Michelle Curwood said apologetically. However, chimed in reptile expert Bloxam, snails do have their advantages. You don't have to determine the sex of a snail to breed it, for example. "They're hermaphrodites," Bloxam pointed out. "That problem doesn't matter so long as you have two."
19891026000000000	GLOBAL TURTLE DIARY SHOWS WORSENING OUTLOOK FOR SURVIVAL. Beneath the moonlight, as she slowly emerges from the sea, a loggerhead turtle cuts a mysterious figure on the foaming shoreline. On steamy summer nights from Virginia to Texas, thousands of these puzzling creatures are poking their scaly, barnacled shells out of the surf. "It looks a little like an invasion of tiny army tanks," says Larry Woods, curator of the Juno Beach Turtle Museum here. He is on the beach at 7 each morning to make sure the nocturnal turtle visits have gone smoothly. Digging their flippers in the sand, the loggerheads inch their 300-pound bodies across the beach to deposit some 100 leathery eggs the size of Ping-Pong balls in three-foot sand pits -- their gift to the future. It is the only reason a turtle comes out of the water. But not all is well with the turtle, Woods is quick to point out. Sea turtles have rapidly become an endangered species. From the Caribbean to the Atlantic, and from the Mediterranean to the Pacific, whole populations of these giant reptiles are disappearing. It is a story of accident and exploitation, a clash with people -- and a phenomenally fast fall for a species as old as the dinosaur. Sea turtles are most at risk during the summer, when they swim ashore to nest. They get tangled in fishing nets and become easy prey for hunters. At one time, the world's oceans were brimming with turtles. Centuries ago, ships' logs said the Caribbean was so full of them one could be guided toward an island by the clacking of their shells knocking together. Earlier this century, "you couldn't row a boat in front of nesting beaches," says Jim Richardson, a turtle expert at the University of Georgia. "Turtles would kick the oars out of the oarlocks." No one knows exactly how many sea turtles exist today because they are sea travelers. But on Mexico's Rancho Nuevo beach, where 40,000 Kemp's ridley turtles nested en masse on a single day in the 1940s, just 400 or 500 nest today. South Carolina's barrier islands have registered an alarming 26% decline in loggerheads nesting just in this decade, says Sally Murphy, the state's chief turtle biologist. Georgia's Cumberland Island National Seashore, nesting beach for 150 turtles 25 years ago, gets about 20 nesters a year now, Richardson says. In Indonesia and Malaysia, hunters who once found their shores flush with quarry must head out to sea. In the Maldives and Cayman Islands, wild turtles have vanished. Recent efforts in the United States to rescue the sea turtle have spawned perhaps the biggest wildlife debate since the 1978 brawl over the snail darter and Tennessee's Tellico Dam. The major turtle killer in U.S. waters is the net of shrimp fisherman, according to environmentalists. After years of pitched debate between them and the shrimp industry, Congress bought the environmental argument and ordered shrimpers to put "turtle excluder devices" in their trawling nets. Legislators say that could save 12,000 turtles a year. The regulation took effect May 1. But after wide civil disobedience by shrimp fishers, it was scrapped, at least temporarily. Atlantic fishermen on the whole complied with the regulation, but thousands of fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico are fighting it tooth and nail. Worldwide, the chief threat to the turtle is international trade. Sometimes legally, but often not, African, Asian, and Caribbean turtle hunters supply Asia's huge appetite for turtle-shell jewelry and turtle leather accessories. The eating of turtle eggs and meat has helped deplete populations too. "The sea turtle," says Michael Weber of the Center for Marine Conservation, "is probably the most salable animal in the world. All its parts can be sold for meat, soup or shell." Japan is reportedly ending its stuffed-turtle trade, and there are some treaties and laws intended to help endangered animals. But so far, there has been little success enforcing the measures. The Endangered Species Act, the prime U.S. animal protection tool, "is strong on paper," says Michael Bean, chairman of the Environmental Defense Fund's animal protection program. "The problems are with the willingness of the agencies responsible for implementing the legislation to use their authority effectively." Regulations were enforced in the Gulf only about two of the 11 weeks they were in effect. Commerce Department spokesmen say suspension of the rule leaves time to develop a program that is enforceable. Environmental groups are concerned that the suspension is a precedent and "punches a hole in the Endangered Species Act for all wildlife," says Steve Moyer, a lobbyist for the National Wildlife Federation. The chief international means for preserving turtles is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, signed by 100 countries to limit trade in endangered plants and animals. The record on compliance is not good. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Panama, Belize, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Tanzania and Kenya are engaging in large-scale turtle selling. Jeffrey Canin, a biologist with Greenpeace, and other ecologists are especially worried about Mexico and Indonesia, perhaps the world's two most important turtle-nesting countries. Both have regulations governing wildlife but reportedly are sliding backward on actual protection. Environmentalists acknowledge that it is difficult to tell Third World countries that they should restrict turtle hunting. Turtles are a cheap, local source of food; one animal can provide a poor family's major source of income in a year. But ecologists insist that nations must learn to take fewer eggs and turtles today if they are to have any turtle supply in the future. Seven turtle species still roam the seas. They range from the half-ton, jellyfish-eating leatherbacks, which explore earth's colder oceans, to the 80-pound Kemp's ridleys, which stick mostly to the warm Caribbean.
