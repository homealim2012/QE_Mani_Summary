Term limits What are the pros and cons of term limits What are the similarities and differences among the arguments term limits are considered at the federal state and local levels.
ALMOST FOR LIFE MAYORS KEEP HANGING ONTO OFFICE.
But four of America s top mayors each after more than a decade in office might serve their cities best by exiting City Hall.
Each in his time served his city well.
Marion Barry fought Congress plantation like white rule of black Washington ousted a caretaker administration in 1978 brought energy to District government and instituted some of the country s first minority contracting programs.
Ed Koch got tough with municipal unions cut fat out of New York s bloated budgets and exuded a kind of never say die chutzpah that restored the Big Apple s self confidence after its disastrous fiscal crisis and "down years" of the 70s.
Tom Bradley a quiet and unassuming ex cop not only proved a black could get elected in a polyglot non black town but presided over Los Angeles maturation into one of the world s great cities.
Coleman Young fiery civil rights radical who fought for union rights against the big auto companies in the 30s inherited a Detroit in an advanced stage of urban rot in 1973.
William Milliken and Henry Ford II to pull public aid and private investment into his recession racked city.
But now Koch and Barry are marshaling their tired political troops to run for unprecedented fourth terms.
Bradley and Young for equally unprecedented fifth terms.
Washington New York Los Angeles and Detroit all face new tough problems that none of the incumbents seem well equipped to deal with.
One looks in vain for any sense of vision of mission for their their cities.
Instead their honors busy themselves putting out political fires.
Once the personification of the solution for his town each man looks suspiciously like the problem.
These incumbents might well heed the words of Charles Royer who is voluntarily stepping down after 12 distinguished years as mayor of Seattle.
What seems to motivate Barry Koch Bradley and Young is the thrill of the race not gusto for attacking their cities mounting problems.
Barry personally embroiled in rumors of drug use presides over a city in the grip of terrifying drug wars and a spiraling worst in the nation murder rate.
His bloated bureaucracy appears increasingly dysfunctional.
Business supporters once enamored of Barry s pro development policies for downtown are jumping ship.
There s plausible argument that Barry should resign now but he says the odds are 60 40 that he ll run again next year.
Koch looked the other way as scandals of epic proportions permeated New York officialdom.
There s a growing fearsome gap between New York s ostentatious wealthy and its homeless its underclass and just plain working poor.
Koch s own hot racial rhetoric has polarized the city.
Polls show his support at an all time low.
Bradley now 71 is such a nice guy that many call him a Teflon mayor.
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky raised more than 1 million to challenge Bradley but stepped back when polls showed the mayor virtually unbeatable.
Los Angeles was thus deprived the California Journal reports of a Detroit has blocks of downtown emptiness reminiscent of many cities soon after the riots of the 60s despite the infusion of billions.
In 1988 not a single new house was built in all of Detroit.
Polls show a majority of Detroiters think Young now 70 should step down.
But with a 4 million war chest the old master still lusts for the fray.
Like the President mayors should probably be limited to two or at most three four year terms.
After eight or 12 years exhaustion corruption boredom often times arrogance come sneaking in however brilliant the leader may have been.
We have a Congress full of nearly invincible incumbents feeding off special interest contributions.
And now we may be threatened by almost for life mayors feeding off the huge contributions of developers and other interests with a big stake in city contracts and zoning.
Philadelphia San Francisco Dallas and Atlanta are lucky to be among the relatively few cities with limits on mayors terms.
For other towns the only solution may be for voters alert enough to say "Thanks for the memories" and then show their burnt out incumbents the door.
TWO WHO WANT TO LIMIT OFFICE TENURE DIFFER ON HOW TO DO IT.
Proponents of initiatives to limit City Council terms in two Palos Verdes Peninsula cities are reacting differently to a state Court of Appeal ruling that such local regulations are invalid because eligibility to hold office is controlled by state law.
Rolling Hills Estates City Councilwoman Jacki McGuire though not retreating from her view that it is "absolutely essential" to limit council service to two terms said she has shelved plans to circulate initiative petitions.
Avoiding Lawsuits said McGuire who advocated limiting terms when she successfully campaigned for office in a March special election.
McGuire said she will try to drum up interest in a statewide measure to put limitation of terms into state election law.
In neighboring Rancho Palos Verdes on the other hand resident Joel Justin King said he plans to proceed with a petition drive for a November initiative limiting council service to two terms.
He called the court ruling a City Clerk Jo Purcell however said that even if King obtains enough voters signatures to qualify his initiative it will not be put on the ballot.
Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes are general law cities.
Such cities operate under the general laws of the state rather than their own municipal charters.
In a ruling affecting the general law city of South San Francisco the 1st Appellate District court in San Francisco ruled on whether South San Francisco City Councilwoman Roberta Cerri Teglia should hold office.
Teglia who is serving a third term on the South San Francisco council was reelected in 1987 despite an ordinance limiting council members to two consecutive terms according to Jim Parrinello her attorney.
t The appellate court decided that numerous state code provisions governing eligibility to hold office in general law cities indicate that the state governs such matters.
Parrinello said the South San Francisco city attorney believed the local law was invalid but it had not been repealed by the City Council.
Warren Steinkamp a former councilman challenged Teglia s reelection in a lawsuit Parrinello said.
The April 12 appellate court opinion became law when it was published and was not appealed to the state Supreme Court within the specified time limit.
Terzian Rolling Hills Estates city attorney.
Legal Opinion Differs But because the Teglia case involved a general law city legal opinion is divided over its application to charter cities such as Redondo Beach and Cerritos which have ordinances limiting time in office to two terms.
The Redondo Beach law enacted in a charter election in 1975 prevented former Mayor Barbara Doerr and Councilman Archie Snow from running for their offices again this year.
Doerr won election to a council seat in the March General Election and Snow was defeated in a bid for mayor.
Gordon Phillips was firm in his belief that the Teglia case is limited to general law cities and does not apply to Redondo Beach.
Phillips said this view is strengthened by the fact that the term limit was voted in For her part Doerr said she supports the two term limit and would not favor a legal challenge.
The Cerritos two term limit was approved by voters in 1986 as a means of preventing long term incumbents from seeking office again.
Ken Brown to issue an opinion that the limit applied only to terms beginning after the ordinance took effect.
Statewide Interest Brown like Phillips said he does not believe the Teglia ruling applies to Cerritos as a charter city.
But he said a court might decide that the issue of term limitation is and apply it to both general law and charter cities.
Teglia s attorney Parrinello said he thinks the ruling applies to both categories of cities because one of the cases cited by the Court of Appeal related to eligibility of elected officers in a chartered county.
he said adding that the other side attempted to distinguish between the two.
But the court held that Parrinello said there may be a distinction when it comes to executive officers such as a mayor because although there are no limits on consecutive terms in Congress there is a constitutional limit on presidential terms.
Terzian also said he believes charter cities as well as general law cities are affected by the ruling adding that the reason cities have adopted term limitations is that Although they have decided to take different roads on term limitations McGuire in Rolling Hills Estates and King in Rancho Palos Verdes are united in a belief that the limitations are needed.
VAN DE KAMP PROPOSES BALLOT PLAN TO LIMIT LAWMAKER TERMS FUNDS.
Bringing his campaign for governor to life after laborious weeks of planning Atty.
John Van de Kamp made a leap for the high ground on government ethics Friday proposing a ballot initiative to limit terms of state officeholders and the money that flows to them from special interests.
He called state government a "swamp" of mighty special interest influence.
To clean it up he said taxpayers will have to pick up a share of the costs of political campaigns for the Legislature the governorship and other statewide offices.
His gameness in challenging the everyday conduct of government and the willingness to force politicians out of their offices after set terms add up to the most daring move of Van de Kamp s long and measured political career.
The two term Democratic attorney general and former Los Angeles County district attorney is facing in depth campaign polls that tell him Californians are not looking for status quo leadership in the 1990 race for governor but are hungry as one adviser put it This package could do precisely that putting the two term Democratic attorney general at odds with legislators and others officeholders in and out of his own party.
Important Issue The initiative also gives Van de Kamp ridiculed by rivals as a "John come lately" something strong to say on an issue destined to play an important part in the 1990 gubernatorial campaign debate.
Major provisions of the ballot proposition as sketched out by Van de Kamp at press conferences in Burbank Sacramento and San Francisco would.
Impose California s first ever limits on the consecutive years a person may hold a single office 12 years for the Assembly and Senate and eight years for statewide constitutional officers.
Ask candidates for the Legislature and statewide office to accept a ceiling on their campaign spending in exchange for public financing of approximately 25 to 40 of their total political budgets.
The exact ceiling on each race and the overall costs to taxpayers are still being devised.
Enact assorted other changes in ethics laws including a ban on political honorariums and stricter conflict of interest restrictions on legislative votes.
Future attorney generals would be empowered to appoint special prosecutors in some corruption cases.
In addition public officials including legislators would be banned from lobbying state government for a year after leaving office.
Van de Kamp said reading a prepared statement.
Van de Kamp indicated that he will confer with public interest leaders to iron out details of the proposal and give lawmakers in Sacramento one last chance to take dramatic action on their own.
Then he said he will proceed with a signature gathering drive to obtain the 595 485 valid voter names needed to win the measure a slot on the November 1990 general election ballot.
Announcement of the ethics initiative came at a time when Van de Kamp s campaign his status as the Establishment favorite for the Democratic nomination and his image as a "winner" are being called to question by party activists and even some of his own supporters.
Throughout the spring and summer Van de Kamp has felt pressure to engage more energetically in the 1990 campaign preliminaries.
But he resisted even as rivals seemed to be gaining at his expense.
The attorney general insisted on marshaling and developing an inventory of ideas in private consultation with his team of political advisers and at his own deliberate pace.
Campaign manager Richie Ross quoted the lyrics of a 1960s rhythm and blues song to explain the virtue of Van de Kamp s slow but sure methods.
Friday s proposal for a ballot initiative was the first of a series of announcements resulting from the planning sessions.
The package of ideas eventually is supposed to provide the framework and rationale for Van de Kamp s gubernatorial bid.
He began the sequence with ethics probably because he has been viewed both by opponents and supporters as increasingly vulnerable on the issue.
This is not because of his own ethics which so far as is known are untarnished but because he is California s chief law enforcement officer at a time when the spotlight on government has come to rest on numerous political scandals.
Van de Kamp to the dismay of political supporters has been only a bit player in the investigations.
Both of Van de Kamp s leading rivals have already signaled their own strategies that recognize the public s growing doubts about the integrity of government.
Shaping Campaign Dianne Feinstein the former mayor of San Francisco is shaping her Democratic primary campaign to present herself as an outsider capable of restoring people s faith in government.
As for Van de Kamp s initiative Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers dismissed it saying Republican candidate for governor Pete Wilson in his second term as a U.
senator frequently draws a parallel between his career 18 years ago and his campaign now.
Back then he left a seat in the Legislature to take over as mayor of San Diego amid a corruption scandal there.
As for Van De Kamp Wilson spokesman Otto Bos said.
He has shown no reluctance to accept PAC money special interest money.
The only constant has been his desire for public funds for campaigns.
I just finished 12 years and I feel better equipped than ever to represent my constituents our system of government has hardened into a gridlock of caution incumbency protection and the servicing of special interests.
This change is worth trying because what we re doing now isn t working.
" Times staff writer Clay Evans in Sacramento contributed to this article.
John Van de Kamp has placed a new issue on California s political reform agenda.
Last month Van de Kamp announced he would sponsor an initiative that would among other things limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive terms and state legislators to 12 years of consecutive service in each house.
In advocating term limits Van de Kamp argued that He concluded that the "drastic step" was necessary because The term limitation idea is not really drastic or new.
We limit Presidents and 26 states limit governors to two terms.
Nor does the federal Constitution limit congressional terms.
Thus the Van de Kamp proposal is in this respect at least a radical one.
Nevertheless given certain conditions in California politics today a reasonable case can be made for the imposition of such limits.
At the heart of that case is the reality that political competition is virtually extinct at the state level.
In the last three legislative campaigns (1982 1984 1986) only three incumbents seeking reelection lost and 273 incumbents won.
Reductions in electoral competition in turn yield reductions in legislative turnover.
Electoral safety not only enables incumbents to stay where they are it also discourages them from challenging other equally secure incumbents in other offices.
While 49 new members entered the Assembly between 1978 82 only 21 of the current 80 members have been elected in the last six years.
Such low levels of competition and turnover may result in a loss of electoral and legislative vitality and the responsiveness of the Legislature to new ideas and changing political styles.
In addition to the natural advantages (name identification connections etc.
) held by incumbents there would appear to be two main causes of today s low levels of legislative competition and turnover.
The power of the Legislature to redraw legislative district boundaries generally results in safer seats for large numbers if not the majority of incumbents.
During the last 10 to 20 years most parts of the state have grown increasingly competitive.
Gerrymandered district lines can insulate the Legislature from this trend.
And incumbents who are able to raise almost unlimited sums from special interest groups maintain nearly insurmountable fund raising advantages over potential challengers.
In the non election year of 1987 legislative candidates raised more than 25 million 98 of it going to incumbents.
During the 1988 elections incumbents outspent all other candidates combined by almost 5 to 1.
Term limitations would address the incumbency advantage problem.
They would force more competition and turnover especially since many incumbents would as they approached their limit in one house challenge incumbents in other races.
There is value to experience and expertise in public office and limitations that force out numerous high quality lawmakers at the peak of their effectiveness could have undesirable impacts on the legislative process.
In addition term limits may increase conflict of interest pressures on some legislators especially if the limits imposed are too stringent.
Such a circumstance could reduce the productivity and energy of the Legislature and it may expose many members to the influence of those special interests and others capable of easing a transition from public to private life.
The key element in the case against term limits hinges on the democratic right of the electorate to elect whom it chooses including incumbents.
It would be even more compelling in a truly competitive political environment.
The incumbent s right to seek reelection amounts to a virtual guarantee of reelection.
Thus allowing incumbents the right to unlimited terms carries the heavy price tag of seriously diminishing opportunities for competition debate and choice.
The most obvious alternative means of generating competition entail redrawing legislative district boundaries and reducing the enormous advantages now afforded incumbents by the current mechanisms of campaign financing.
Reforms such as a ban on non election year fund raising which reduces incumbents advantages or public financing which increases challengers chances would unquestionably stimulate more political competition.
A redistricting plan drawn by some entity other than legislative incumbents could also dramatically alter the non competitive environment.
In the absence of these reforms term limitations seem more appealing.
But such limits should allow for reasonably lengthy tenure in office and and thus for the development of adequate levels of experience and expertise.
In addition a term limits proposal might be strengthened by the inclusion of certain ethics reforms including revolving door provisions and restrictions on outside earned income.
These might reduce the conflict of interest dilemmas that term limitations can engender.
PICUS JOINS GROUPS SEEKING TO RESTRICT TERMS IN OFFICE.
City Councilwoman Joy Picus joined representatives of San Fernando Valley community groups Tuesday in urging a commission on ethics in city government to limit the number of terms elected officials can serve.
Picus who has been on the council for 12 years told Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley s ethics commission that a limit on terms in office would in ethical matters by entrenched politicians.
Limits would also provide for politicians eager to move to higher office she said.
Picus said she favors limiting terms of all local and state officeholders.
Presently there are no limitations on how many terms that state legislators and elected Los Angeles officials can serve.
Picus appeared at a public hearing in Studio City held by the ethics commission formally named the Commission to Draft an Ethics Code for Los Angeles City Government.
It was the seventh meeting and the first at which community comment was sought since the commission was set up in April amid controversy over Bradley s financial affairs.
City state and federal agencies are looking into the mayor s stock transactions and whether his influence resulted in the deposit of city funds into Far East National Bank for which he was a paid adviser.
Bradley has returned the fees and denied using his official position to benefit himself or business associates.
New Standards The commission s novel charter is to redefine proper conduct by city officials.
It already has recommended tough new standards for officials to disclose investments real estate holdings and other financial interests saying existing disclosure laws were weak and poorly enforced.
Kurt Hunter of the North Hollywood Residents Assn.
said local officeholders should be held to two four year terms.
He proposed that those who can win a 60 majority in a subsequent election be allowed another two years in office.
But Mark Harrar assistant director of California Common Cause said a two term limit would be "a bit too restrictive.
" He said too strict a limit would drive good politicians out of office just as they acquire expertise in government.
But Harrar said Common Cause supports limits on terms only if they are accompanied by new limits on campaign contributions and spending calling the ability of incumbents to build up large campaign treasuries their most important advantage over challengers.
Harrar said a study done by his group showed that Los Angeles City Council members have served an average of 12 years and that four members have served 25 years or more.
The study also found that between 1982 and 1988 only seven newcomers were elected to the state Legislature while 340 incumbents were reelected.
It has gotten to the point where would be challengers have before they can enter the race he said.
The ethics commission is expected to hold four more hearings before presenting its final report.
Among other topics the hearings will examine if city elections should be publicly financed.
INGLEWOOD GROUP WANTS TO LIMIT TERMS IN OFFICE.
A group of Inglewood residents citing the potential for among incumbent officeholders has begun preparing a ballot initiative for next June that would limit all of Inglewood s elected officials to three consecutive terms in office.
Even before the petitions have hit the streets however strong opposition is developing.
Critics call the measure a political move by a small group of residents to steer their candidates into office and wrest control of city government from the incumbents and the voters.
said the newly formed Inglewood Citizens for Reasonable Reform wants a limit on government service to keep elected officials accountable to the voters and to lessen the stronghold incumbents have on their seats whether they are effective or not.
But third term Councilman Anthony Scardenzan who would be prevented from seeking reelection if the measure goes into effect called the initiative crazy.
The measure would allow Mayor Edward Vincent first elected in 1982 only one more four year term in office.
Scardenzan and Councilman Daniel Tabor who were both first elected in 1981 could not run for reelection when their third terms end in 1993.
City Clerk Hermanita Harris first elected in 1985 and City Treasurer Wanda Brown first elected in 1987 would have two more terms.
Council member Jose Fernandez elected to complete an unexpired term in June could continue as a councilman for two or three four year terms depending on whether his unexpired term is counted as a full term.
The proposed City Charter amendment would permit a maximum of three consecutive terms in a single position and would permit those who have reached the limit to run for another office or sit out four years before running again.
Scardenzan charged that Price a supporter of Tabor is proposing the measure as a political ploy to ease competition for future city races.
Once Vincent is out of the way as mayor Tabor would have a better chance of winning that position Scardenzan said.
Not a Scheme But Price insisted that the initiative is a step toward more responsible government and not a scheme to take over any politician s seat.
Tabor said he has nothing to do with the ballot initiative.
To get the proposed City Charter amendment on the ballot next June the group must collect signatures from 15 of the city s registered voters an estimated 7 500 names.
The measure s proponents submitted a notice of intent to circulate the petition last Friday.
Howard Rosten must now prepare an impartial ballot summary and title in the coming weeks.
After a newspaper notice of the measure is published the petitions can begin circulating.
Price said the initiative must gain widespread grass roots support because it is not in elected officials interest to endorse it.
He said the measure is already supported by many neighborhood and civic leaders small business owners and former elected officials.
He added later Inglewood s 100 member United Democratic Club is expected to support the initiative at its meeting Thursday the group s vice president Terry Coleman said.
Citing big city machine politics such as the long term administration of the late Chicago Mayor Richard J.
Neither For Nor Against Tabor said his position is somewhere between the measure s critics and supporters.
said Tabor who was narrowly elected to his third four year term in June.
Tabor said the limits would in leadership positions but he added The thing that troubles me the most is that it takes a while to learn how the process works before you can make long term changes "Tabor continued.
"You ll be constantly forced to deal with short term things.
Most development projects take five to 10 years to put together.
If they collect enough signatures and it passes let the will of the people be done "Fernandez said.
"3 Terms Sufficient "I ve observed over the years that there is a tendency to become so dependent on the office you hold that you become corrupt in your efforts to hold that office "Weinstein said.
I always looked at public office as public service.
" Inglewood s school board already limits its members to three consecutive four year terms and supporters of the initiative said more than 125 municipalities across the country limit their elected officials terms.
Twenty six states also limit their governors to two consecutive terms.
But a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled in April that some local measures limiting terms in office are invalid because eligibility to hold office is controlled by state law.
That ruling concerned general law cities those that operate under general laws of the state rather than their own municipal charters but the ruling s possible application to charter cities such as Inglewood remains in question.
The court reviewed the case of a councilwoman in South San Francisco who was reelected to a third term in 1987 despite a local law forbidding more than two consecutive terms.
In its decision the court upheld the election of Councilwoman Roberta Cerri Teglia and decided that numerous state code provisions governing eligibility to hold office in general law cities indicate that the state governs such matters.
In the general law city of Rolling Hills Estates Councilwoman Jacki McGuire said she has shelved plans to circulate petitions on a similar initiative in that city because of the recent court decision.
Instead McGuire is attempting to gain support from state officials for a bill that would allow general law cities to limit their own officeholders terms.
If that fails McGuire said she would consider launching a statewide initiative that would put the issue on the ballot.
Ran for Other Offices Redondo Beach and Cerritos are two charter cities in the Los Angeles area that have already passed ordinances limiting time in office to two terms.
The Redondo Beach law enacted in a charter election in 1975 prevented former Mayor Barbara Doerr and City Councilman Archie Snow from running for their offices again this year.
Doerr won election to the council in March and Snow was defeated in a bid for mayor.
Snow has hired a lawyer to challenge the law.
The Cerritos two term limit was approved by voters in 1986 as a means of preventing long term incumbents from seeking office again.
Ken Brown to issue an opinion that the limit applied only to terms beginning after the ordinance took effect.
Van de Kamp has incorporated a proposed limit on the terms of state officeholders into his gubernatorial campaign.
Van de Kamp proposed the state s first ever limits on the consecutive years a person may hold a single office 12 years for the Assembly and Senate and eight years for statewide constitutional officers.
Van de Kamp s proposed limits would not be retroactive but would start as of the 1990 elections.
The reforms of the Progressive era made California s state and local governments widely admired national models.
But now the ability of most of those measures to guarantee open honest government has declined.
This is why a new reform movement has begun.
Many of the proposals being advanced as part of it are welcome and constructive.
others particularly the suggestion that limits be placed on the number of terms an elected official may serve would create problems more serious than any they might solve.
The widespread frustration that attracts people to such proposals is understandable.
On the state level for example the Progressive reformers cherished instrument of direct democracy the initiative has become little more than another tool of political technology.
Too often nowadays ballot propositions are devices by which candidates can circumvent legal spending limits.
Locally Los Angeles nonpartisan managerial form of city government recently has been reluctant to deal not only with complex policy issues such as growth but also with allegations of its own malfeasance or corruption as in the as yet unresolved case of Mayor Tom Bradley.
The melancholy situation engendered by such institutional decadence can be seen either as an historical misfortune or as an historic opportunity.
This was the attitude taken by Los Angeles Cowan Commission.
Its far reaching proposals for the reform of local government ought to be passed by Los Angeles City Council and closely studied by other municipalities.
The commission s approach which includes tough conflict of interest laws and public disclosure provisions offers far more promise than attempts to use the initiative process to impose legal limits on the number of terms elected officials may serve.
Two such problematic efforts currently are seeking signatures to qualify for the ballot.
One part of a statewide reform package is being promoted by Atty.
John Van de Kamp as part of campaign to win the Democrats gubernatorial nomination.
The other measure which would deny Los Angeles elected officials more than two consecutive terms in the same post is being advanced by a coalition of neighborhood groups and unsuccessful candidates for local office.
Superficially attractive and emotionally appealing though they may be term limits are almost always of dubious legality.
The courts already have struck them down for cities without charters and are considering challenges to their application in municipalities with charters such as Los Angeles.
Term limits are almost always bad public policy as well.
In those cities and on the state level passage of term limits also would upset the balance of power between elected officials who often require years of service to command the details of complicated policy questions and senior civil servants who are far less easily held accountable by the public.
Perhaps most disturbing imposition of term limits would constitute a collective admission that both our government and our politics have failed.
Such limits presume that public service must inevitably corrupt the majority of those who seek it.
This is a dark perspective indeed and if true suggests that California s problems are beyond mending by any ballot measure.
Term limits scoff at the ability of the people to recognize official corruption for what it is and to hold those who yield to it accountable through the normal political process.
After all whether the rascals have served one term or 10 they always can be voted out of office or recalled.
There is no evidence that the people of California are either incompetent to work their will through the electoral process or that they wish to be relieved of the responsibility of political participation.
A MANDATORY REVOLVING DOOR WOULD ONLY STRENGTHEN THE BUREAUCRACY.
representative or senator can serve thereby regularly sweeping clean the corridors of power in Washington seems to be the cause of the moment.
People who advocate this proposal accept the logical fallacy that "new is better" and must believe that elective office is the one vocation where experience is an obstacle to good performance.
In our nation s earliest years the citizen legislator was a useful idea.
Leaving the plow and riding horseback to New York Philadelphia or later to Washington was a workable arrangement in a largely agricultural country whose total population in 1790 was about 3.
Today s America is vastly more populous enormously more complicated and requires the full time attention of someone.
Unelected unresponsive and unaccountable the power of bureaucrats in the day to day operations of government already far exceed that of elected and politically appointed officials whose tenure is inherently transitory.
A mandatory revolving door for elected officials would only strengthen the grip of the permanent bureaucracy.
No one maintains that democracy always produces the best or most noble result but as Winston Churchill reminded us it s better than any other system.
To deny the voters complete choice in who will represent them in Congress is to say that the people can t be trusted.
that their options should be limited by requiring a turnover every few years.
This would effectively deprive our country of the wisdom and experience accumulated over long years of sensitive and sensible service of many outstanding public officials.
To believe as some do that America is governed by a permanent Congress is a great leap not supported by fact.
Only 19 of House members elected before 1974 are still serving.
During Ronald Reagan s presidency there was a 55 turnover in the House.
To assume that a member of Congress can learn all about government in a few years is simplistic nonsense.
If a district or a state is ill served by a second rate representative the remedy is available.
Run better candidates and campaigns and turn the electorate out to vote.
A light turnout reflects the failure of the opposition to ignite the voters.
For Congress to truly reflect the diversity of America its members should be drawn from the widest range of citizens possible.
Because every age group brings a unique perspective.
people in mid life should be encouraged to join the young and the old in public service.
If there are artificial limits on the years of service then the young will begin their careers in Congress and the elderly will end their careers in Congress but those in mid life will be largely unwilling to devote their most productive creative years to a vocation with no tenure and whose only prospect is enforced retirement.
No have faith in democracy let the people choose and don t disqualify those who can bring sound judgment born of years of experience to the increasingly demanding tasks of elected office.
The article states that Hyde has been in the House of Representatives for the past 26 years and bemoans the increasing interest in limiting terms of office.
What should be said is that long terms in office are obstacles to the distribution of power.
Good performances have always been found in the countless dictatorships that have plagued the world during the last few thousand years.
Of far more importance in a democracy is the distribution of power which tends to reduce corruption and tends to create efforts aimed at the betterment of all people rather than just helping special interests.
We do not need "representatives for life" any more than we need "presidents for life.
" Sunset laws for public offices will do a great deal towards reducing the corruption so prevalent today and we should adopt them.
CONSERVATIVES ATTACK CONGRESS AND THEREBY THEIR OWN TRADITION.
REPUBLICANS ARE TIRED OF WINNING THE PRESIDENCY WHILE LOSING HOUSE AND SENATE.
Delegates to the 17th annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this month were urged to support a constitutional amendment by Rep.
) that would limit congressmen to six terms and senators to two terms.
McCollum himself now serving his fifth term wouldn t say whether he would seek a seventh an irony that should not be allowed to obscure deeper issues.
A case can surely be made for ensuring greater competitiveness in political campaigns and removing some of the built in advantages enjoyed by incumbents.
That said it is still distressing to see so called conservatives who pride themselves on devotion to the documents on which the republic was founded seeking to rewrite the Constitution to achieve this goal.
It is more distressing to realize that the push to limit terms is part of a larger assault by right of center forces on the Congress itself including support for a presidential line item veto.
A good chunk of the agenda at this year s Washington CPAC the most significant gathering of conservative leaders and grass roots activists in the nation was devoted to lambasting what they have taken to call "the imperial Congress.
" After a decade of Republican Presidents and largely Democratic Congresses perhaps it is understandable for Reagan Bush Republicans to show some impatience with the legislative branch and a greater identification with the executive.
It would be a serious mistake however to let such impulses harden into dogma.
Conservatives need to remember that throughout most of our history Congress was the predominant force in American government and this was certainly the case during those periods of national development that conservatives view with the most affection.
The great change took place with the New Deal and World War II at precisely the time in other words when the expansion of federal power traditionally deplored by conservatives began to accelerate.
Presidential power increased along with federal power.
This was a development that conservatives at the time like Sen.
Taft (R Ohio) noted denounced and struggled against.
Today s conservatives oddly seem to celebrate it and resist all efforts by Congress to reassert itself.
Angered by Democratic legislatures that have refused to bow to the will of Republican Presidents conservatives shortsightedly have turned an attack on specific Congresses and congressmen into an attack on Congress itself.
The dispute over aid to the Nicaraguan resistence which led to the Iran Contra affair was the result of a President s determination to take action however strongly opposed by the House of Representatives.
Conservatives lined up obediently behind executive power.
The goal ultimately is to by pass Congress by forging a more plebiscitary relationship between the presidency and the voters.
And by dislodging incumbents they hope to seat a Congress more immediately responsive to presidential direction.
Yet they need look no further than one of their own genuine prophets the late James Burnham to see the danger of any such undertaking.
Twenty five years ago when Congress was more powerful than it is today Burnham wondered whether it would survive at all as an If it did not Burnham warned political liberty itself would perish.
The trend of our time at least in this country is toward greater centralization of power in the executive branch.
This trend has continued under Presidents of both parties all of whom have consciously or otherwise worked toward one common aim.
to transform the "people " an independent self governing community of adults into the "masses " whose unfiltered desires these Presidents can embody.
The Founders who feared "despotism " "tyranny" and "monarchy " took pains to make sure it couldn t happen here.
They made the separation of powers central to the new republic and invested the vast majority of governmental power in the legislative branch.
Until fairly recently any number of other institutions at state and local levels helped restrain the executive.
These institutions have for the most part ceased to so restrain leaving only Congress (and at times the courts) to filter the popular will and militate against expansion of presidential power.
Conservatives who also pride themselves on taking the long view of things need finally to bear in mind that there is no guarantee that future Presidents will be as conservative as those elected in recent years.
Someday the liberal Democrats will return to power and when they do the conservatives will surely rue the day they began to wage war on the "imperial Congress.
LIMITING THE TERMS OF OFFICEHOLDERS AND PUBLIC FINANCING OFFER CHALLENGERS A BETTER CHANCE AT DISLODGING ENTRENCHED INCUMBENTS.
It is safe to predict that not many voters will bother to cast ballots June 5.
The consequences are worrisome because it means winners stay in office too long blocking the rise of new leadership and perhaps society s forward movement.
At the state and local levels the reign of incumbents is similar.
One explanation is that the lower you go on the political ladder the less visible the office the less voters know about challengers.
At best choice is little more than recognizing a familiar name.
There are two solutions to non competitive elections now widely discussed in public policy circles.
public financing of campaigns and limiting the terms of officeholders.
Public financing advocates contend that unless challengers gain access to more funds they have virtually no chance at the polls.
With the additional money the candidates can improve their name recognition among voters thereby enhancing their competitiveness.
For that reason incumbents tend to be wary of public financing especially when it comes to their own campaigns.
They are less reluctant to tap taxpayer funds for campaigns in which others politicians are running.
Congress for example made public financing the law in presidential campaigns.
When some form of public financing is instituted incumbents want to keep spending limits low to prevent their opponents from spending enough to gain name recognition.
The other solution to incumbency stalemate is limiting the terms of officeholders.
Come November Californians can choose to limit the terms of Assembly members and senators.
And Angelenos can sign a petition to be able to restrict the tenure of council members and certain elected officials.
(The Los Angeles version is especially anti incumbent because it would retroactively impose a two term limit.
Governors in 29 states also can t spend the rest of their lives running their states.
But thus far few cities and no state have set term limits for legislators.
It is quite possible that if the term limit clock began ticking for the "permanent Congress " as it is known in Washington these days the consequences would ripple throughout the electoral system.
The idea that public service careers should start in the school committee or city council advance to the state legislature to Congress and then on to the presidency loses it appeal when you consider the average tenure of the respective officeholders.
Typically a Los Angeles council member has been in office 13 years a supervisor 18.
In Sacramento an Assembly member on average has been in office for 15 years a state senator for 12.
The average tenure of the California delegation to the House of Representatives is 11 years.
At that rate it would take 69 years just to run for the U.
Reapportionment old age changing ambitions the need to make more money and new opportunities however help to maintain the turnover in most of these governmental bodies.
Sixty percent of the California delegation to Washington has been elected since 1980.
likewise 54 of the state senators and 65 of the Assembly members.
Talent hard work and experience are needed to become a good politician.
It usually takes years to develop the skills to rise to positions of leadership in legislatures.
) is invariably preceded by "well respected " in large part because his judgment on military matters is the result of long study and service on the Armed Services Committee.
Advocates of term limits would eliminate the Nunns.
On the other hand if terms were restricted the time it takes to advance might shrink proportionately.
Seniority could be achieved in six or eight years not 10 or 20.
Since political issues tend to recycle themselves several times during a 10 year period maybe the country would be better served by new leaders the second or third time around.
A more serious drawback to term limits is that they are anti democratic because they eliminate choice.
We rely on voters to hold elected officeholders accountable.
If a politician s constituents wish to reelect him or her year after year they should be able to do so.
The problem in the end is that we really don t have a choice because we don t know enough about the candidates.
Sometimes we pick candidates because we know something about them are able to discern their positions by virtue of their party affiliation or because the issues have been widely discussed during the campaign.
Most of the time however the choice is between a vaguely familiar name and one that is totally unknown.
Public financing where available has proved to be effective in increasing political competitiveness.
The two term limit for President and one or two term limit for governors more likely reduces bossism and corruption than promote competitiveness.

A GROUP AIMING TO INCREASE MINORITY REPRESENTATION ON THE CITY COUNCIL BY SHIFTING FROM AT LARGE ELECTIONS SUFFERS A SETBACK.
The Santa Monica City Council has rebuffed a citizens group that was seeking to place on the November ballot a measure that would replace the at large system of council representation with a district system and limit council members to two consecutive terms in office.
Instead the council voted Tuesday to refer the issue to a Charter commission as yet unnamed that would be charged with studying a number of issues including council pay raises.
The unanimous vote followed a lengthy public hearing during which impassioned speakers said it was imperative to elect council members by district to give minorities a voice in City Hall.
said Henry McGee a UCLA law professor.
Only two blacks have ever served on the council and there has never been a Latino member.
City officials estimate that about 20 000 Latinos live in the city of 97 000 many of them in the Pico neighborhood which was repeatedly mentioned Tuesday night as lacking a voice at City Hall.
Recent court rulings such as one pertaining to the city of Watsonville have concluded that at large elections in some California cities have prevented minorities from winning office.
Robert Myers said in a telephone interview that the city is not legally required to shift to districts.
Many at the public hearing also complained that rent control has been the driving force behind Santa Monica elections for years leading to a system where only those candidates allied with politically potent and well financed special interest groups stand a chance of being elected.
A limit of two consecutive terms is needed to dilute the power of incumbents speakers said.
The few who spoke in opposition to the idea said they preferred having all seven council members accountable to the entire populace as it is now.
The proposal for the elections by district and two term limit is the work of a group called Citizens United to Reform Elections whose members said they have been trying to advance the idea for two years.
They did not collect signatures on petitions to qualify the measure for the ballot saying they lack the financial resources to do so.
Instead they asked the City Council to put the issue to the voters as a "good government" measure.
CURE includes representatives of local Democratic clubs local chapters of the Mexican American Political Assn.
and a minority not typically included in under represented groups in other less liberal municipalities.
Before voting with their colleagues to refer CURE s proposal to the Charter commission council members David Finkel and Ken Genser said they strongly supported elections by district even though the two were themselves elected on a Santa Monica for Renters Rights slate.
Finkel said that though some might argue civil rights is already a prime value in Santa Monica District elections will not harm rent control Genser said but will broaden the number of issues addressed and provide a council that reflects the ethnic diversity of the community.
In 1975 a ballot measure to create district elections failed.
In 1988 Proposition J which would have created numbered citywide council districts was also defeated.
The CURE group opposed the proposition on the grounds that it would protect incumbents and hinder minorities.
BROWN ASSAILS INITIATIVE TO LIMIT TERMS IN OFFICE.
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown aimed his rhetorical guns at Pete Schabarum s term limits initiative Tuesday accusing the Los Angeles County supervisor of a "mean spirited" attempt to return the state to an era when big money corporate lobbyists controlled the Legislature.
Brown said legendary lobbyist Artie Samish made famous in a photograph in which he held a puppet "legislator" on his arm could have written the measure himself.
Brown a San Francisco Democrat told reporters at a Capitol press conference.
The initiative Proposition 140 on the November ballot would limit Assembly members to three terms and state senators and statewide officers including the governor to two terms.
It also would sharply reduce what the Legislature could spend on its staff and operations and would eliminate the Legislature s taxpayer financed retirement plan.
Van de Kamp would limit state legislators to 12 successive years in one office six terms for the Assembly or three in the Senate.
The Van de Kamp initiative also would limit statewide elected officials to two terms.
Schabarum a Republican could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
But Mike Lewis a spokesman for the Proposition 140 campaign denied Brown s charge that the initiative would increase the power of special interests.
Brown last spring helped raise more than 5 million much of it from the very special interests he often attacks to defeat Propositions 118 and 119 two ballot measures that would have limited the power of lawmakers to draw their own district lines.
The Speaker hinted Tuesday that a similar campaign is in the works to defeat Propositions 131 and 140 beginning with a fund raiser Sept.
Brown focused his ire on Proposition 140 which he has said he considers a personal attack on his leadership of the Assembly.
He said the initiative s provision to cut the Legislature s budget by more than one third would deprive lawmakers of their professional analysts and in turn make them more dependent on lobbyists for their information.
The lobbying corps would be given a further advantage by the initiative because the term limits would force lawmakers out of office just as they were gaining the expertise to be effective Brown said.
said Brown who is in his 13th term in the Assembly.
TORRANCE COUNCIL REJECTS CHANGES OFFERED BY LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS.
An effort to change the Torrance City Charter and revise how City Council members get paid was firmly rebuffed Tuesday by a committee of council members who say they remain unconvinced that major changes are needed.
The Torrance League of Women Voters had called for the review saying that some sections of the charter are obsolete.
A league report described the current method of paying council members as misleading and it urged limiting council members to two four year terms.
All seven current City Council members have served at least one term.
The league arguments failed to sway the council committee charged with studying the proposals.
said Councilman Mark Wirth one of the committee s three members.
said Jeanette Pierson who chaired the league s charter review group.
added league President Lynitta Schaffer citing members pay and term limits.
Schaffer could not predict Tuesday what her group will do in the face of the committee decision.
The council committee unanimously recommended against the league request for a thorough charter review by a citizens panel.
Members did say they would be willing look at individual concerns that the league chooses to bring to the council.
The full City Council will act on the recommendation probably in the next two weeks said Councilwoman Dee Hardison chairwoman of the Employee Relations and Department Organization Committee.
The 90 member Torrance league has successfully suggested some charter changes in the past.
It made its latest recommendations in mid June after a yearlong study of the charter which is the basic document outlining city operations.
Mayor Katy Geissert referred the matter to Hardison s committee.
One major recommendation would have struck the charter provision for paying council members 100 a month.
The league instead believes that council salaries should be set each year during the annual budget process.
League members called the 100 salary misleading because it does not reflect the other ways that council members are reimbursed such as a flat monthly 410 car allowance and reimbursements of up to 250 in expenses monthly.
But council members said Tuesday they are reluctant to wade into the subject of council compensation.
Councilman Dan Walker said he disagrees that the current method of compensation needs reform.
Council members were also cool toward the idea of limiting themselves to two four year terms.
The league had suggested the limit in the hope of encouraging more people to run for council seats.
In the March 1990 election only one challenger emerged to run against three incumbents for three seats.
Hardison added however And she pointed out the mayor is now limited to two terms.
One league concern did stir some mild interest that of whether the city clerk and treasurer should be appointed rather than elected as they are today.
Bramhall wants the City Council to appoint the clerk just as it appoints the city manager and city attorney.
THE CONSEQUENCE WILL BE INCREASED STAFF POWER A CURE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE.
In 1978 the vote on Proposition 13 California s tax limitation initiative ushered in a revolt against big government that shaped the politics of the 80s.
Today Oklahoma will vote on an initiative to limit terms in office which may signal a revolt that shakes up the politics of the 90s.
The initiative is a product and symptom of growing public disillusionment with politics as usual.
Polls indicate overwhelming public support for the measure which would put a 12 year limit on service in the state House and Senate.
Similar measures will be on the California and Colorado ballots in November.
Supporters of these measures are talking about pushing such proposals in a dozen other states by 1992 and are aiming at limiting congressional tenure as well.
Democrats whose party controls Congress seem just as eager as Republicans to shuffle the deck.
While the support is broad and nonpartisan the impetus for term limitation comes from people in the business world both mavericks and Establishment types who are frustrated in their desire to cut spending and regulation by government.
An entrepreneur he has served in the Legislature for three years just long enough to convince him that no one should serve more than eight.
Although he has been a GOP activist and fund raiser for many years his motivation cannot be dismissed as purely partisan.
As he points out his party has a solid hold on both houses of the Colorado Legislature.
Considine says he is convinced that term limits will encourage better people to seek office and pave the way for passage of other reforms including steps to make legislative and congressional districts more competitive and reduce incumbents advantages in financing their campaigns.
I think that he and the other term limitation people have got the cart before the horse.
What we need are competitive elections not arbitrary limits on service.
The unintended consequence of term limits will be to increase the power of unelected officials legislative staffs and executive branch bureaucrats.
Their expertise will become even more influential when the elected officials are all short timers and their arrogance will grow.
But that kind of argument is not going to slow this freight train.
The incumbents at both state and national levels are too obviously guilty of feathering their own nests for the public to see that it really has a stake in keeping some of them on the job for more than a few years.
They have collected extravagant campaign contributions from the lobbyists who must come to them for help.
And they have expanded the perquisites of office their taxpayer financed staffs and communications to such a level that they are virtually guaranteed reelection as long as they want the job.
No one can defend a system in which 98 of the incumbents who seek reelection to Congress win year after year.
No one can defend the Colorado status quo where Considine says no incumbent elected governor has lost since 1962 and no incumbent state senator has been defeated in eight years.
If the incumbents don t recognize the need to permit their challengers to compete on more equal terms their tenure will almost certainly be reduced by arbitrary term limits.
And those term limits will eliminate the able and talented right along with the phonies and the hacks.
TERM LIMITATIONS COULD PRODUCE A NEAR REVOLUTION IN POLITICS.
A dozen years ago California voters passed Proposition 13 the property tax limitation initiative setting in motion a taxpayer revolt that swept across the country.
Now Oklahoma voters by a 2 1 margin have made their state the first to limit the number of years a legislator may serve.
Such measures will be prominent on the November ballots in Colorado and California.
In California opponents of the two initiatives to limit terms of state officeholders say they doubt that the Oklahoma vote will significantly influence opinion.
Supporters of the measures not surprisingly see it as reinforcing a swelling sense that term limitation is an idea whose time has come.
Probably all would agree with California Senate President Pro Tem David A.
Roberti (D Los Angeles) an opponent of term limits who acknowledges the national dimensions of the limitation movement.
Nothing is more calculated to make a professional politician s blood run cold than the prospect of being limited by law and not just voter preference to a finite term of service.
Many see any abridgement of voters rights to reelect officeholders as many times as they want as a blow to democratic principle.
Of course if voters themselves freely choose to abridge that right the argument becomes moot.
1 limits an individual s lifetime service in the state Legislature to 12 years.
California s Propositions 131 and 140 though they conflict to some degree would among other things set term limits for nearly all state elective offices in the Legislature and in the Executive Branch.
6 when voters make decisions that could produce a near revolutionary transformation of the state s political landscape.
BUT INTEREST GROUPS WITH THEIR OWN AGENDAS ARE FUNNELING THE ANGER TO THEIR OWN BENEFIT.
Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so according to the pundits and the polls.
Students of government like me find it hard to understand why.
Contrary to most of the propaganda on the subject these constitutional changes won t do what their proponents say they want to accomplish.
For example term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections.
Forcing senior members of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the veterans already have.
This will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it.
Veteran members proven vote getters are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment.
Term limitations won t improve the functioning of the legislature either.
Term limitations throw away the benefits of learning from experience.
Inexperienced legislators are less powerful in relation to legislative staff executive branch bureaucrats and interest group lobbyists from whom they must learn the customs and routines of legislative operations and the stories behind policy proposals.
New people in any complex institution are highly dependent on the people around them.
Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them.
Of course we should pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those whose performance we find wanting.
Term limits merely guarantee that the good will disappear along with the bad.
Finally term limitations won t enhance representative democracy.
Just the opposite since they create an artificial barrier preventing voters from returning to office legislators they might otherwise favor.
It is hard to see how restricting voters alternatives in this arbitrary way can be proposed in the name of representative government or of democracy.
More likely groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.
They are undoubtedly calculating that non incumbents are easier to beat or buy.
LEGISLATIVE TERM LIMITS BACKED BY BIG MARGIN.
The California electorate is in a mood to join Oklahoma in imposing term limits on state legislators in a broad based revolt against failures in Sacramento The Los Angeles Times Poll has found.
Voters are angry at the Legislature as an institution rather than its individual members the survey indicated.
When it comes to the lawmakers in the citizens districts there seems to be no great fervor to "throw the rascals out.
" observed Times political analyst William Schneider.
Whatever the motivation California voters are moving toward following the lead of Oklahoma which on Sept.
18 became the first state to impose term limits on legislators.
Colorado also has a term limit proposal on its ballot Nov.
Americans traditionally have been more critical of legislative institutions such as Congress than they have of their local representatives.
What is different this year is that Californians and voters in a couple of other states have an opportunity to strike out against the institution while still voting for its members.
Voters in this state will have two term limit initiatives to consider.
Either one would dramatically change the political system in Sacramento.
Right now both are favored by comfortable margins The Times Poll found.
Van de Kamp would limit legislators to 12 consecutive years in office and impose limits of two four year terms on most statewide elective offices such as governor.
It would permit candidates for state office to help finance their campaigns with tax money if they adhered to spending limits.
It also would impose some ethics rules by limiting gifts and honorariums.
The Times Poll found voters to be supporting Proposition 131 by 50 to 34 with 16 undecided.
Proposition 140 sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum would impose tighter term limits six years total in the Assembly and four in the Senate.
The governor and other elected statewide officials could serve two four year terms.
The measure would also eliminate the Legislature s pension system and cut back substantially on legislative expenses.
Voters like Schabarum s initiative even more than Van de Kamp s.
Proposition 140 was favored by nearly 2 to 1 in the survey 55 to 28 with 17 undecided.
Both term limit measures similarly were leading by big margins in a Times poll last month.
Voters also were asked their opinions of Proposition 128 the sweeping environmental protection proposal called "Big Green" by its sponsors and denounced as "the Hayden initiative" by its opponents.
People were split virtually down the middle on the measure exactly as they were a month ago.
The Times Poll conducted telephone interviews with 1 892 registered voters for a six day period ending last Tuesday night.
The margin of error for this size poll is 3 percentage points in either direction.
Susan Pinkus assistant Times Poll director supervised the survey.
6 will be asked to consider 28 ballot measures including a modern record 13 initiatives.
Voters told The Times Poll this is a bit much.
The main cause of this ballot overload they said is that The No.
2 culprit voters contended is that Californians have a very low opinion of the Legislature as a whole.
Asked to rate its job performance the voters reply was 2 to 1 negative.
Naturally people who disapprove of the Legislature are the most likely to support the term limit initiatives.
Voters also have an unfavorable impression of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D San Francisco) the Legislature s most powerful and best known member.
In many ways Speaker Brown symbolizes the Legislature as an institution.
It is the institution that voters are especially angry at not with individual members.
When voters were asked whether their local Assembly member the answer was 46 yes 17 no and 37 not sure.
Support for the term limit measures spans the entire political spectrum Democrats as well as Republicans liberals as well as conservatives.
But Big Green Proposition 128 provokes sharp divisions.
There also is a significant gender gap involving Big Green.
It is most popular in the state s two largest urban areas Los Angeles County and the Bay Area.
Voters in the Central Valley farm belt are split.
The negative public image of Big Green s controversial chairman Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D Santa Monica) continues to hurt the proposal interviews showed.
The voters impression of Hayden is only 27 favorable against 43 unfavorable and 30 not sure.
When people who dislike Hayden hear that he is pushing Big Green their opposition to the measure doubles.
Opponents of Big Green point out that the liberal assemblyman has his eye on running for the new state office of environmental advocate that the initiative he co authored would create.
Voters by 2 to 1 said establishing this office would be They rejected the notion that the new post would A key element of the supporters strategy is to inform voters that chemical companies are among the measure s chief opponents.
This knowledge made virtually no difference to voters surveyed by The Times.
Half were told that chemical interests were trying to defeat the measure and half were not.
What did seem to make a difference was a voter s assessment of California s "quality of life.
" People who believed it had stayed the same or improved in the last decade tended to oppose Big Green.
Those who thought the state s quality of life had declined and they represented nearly 6 in 10 of those surveyed tended to favor the measure.
Basically the complex initiative seeks to solve several environmental problems.
Among other things it would ban cancer causing chemicals in food save old growth redwoods tax oil companies to pay for potential oil spills and reduce gases that contribute to global warming and depletion of the ozone layer.
VOTER PREFERENCES Following are results from a Los Angeles Times Poll of 1 892 registered voters including Democrats Republicans Independents and others.
And it is true that as the race for governor speeds toward a Nov.
6 climax Feinstein increasingly has been talking about changes she would make in such areas as education crime and health care.
For example while campaigning before labor groups last week she repeatedly promised to sign a bill providing health insurance for California s 5 million uninsured workers "within 100 days" of taking office.
But there is one "change" voters seem to be demanding that she cannot promise in fact one she does not even care to talk about very much.
That is a major shake up of the political system in Sacramento starting with term limits for legislators.
She does not believe in term limits the candidate will say if pressed because they weaken a Legislature by destroying the opportunity to develop experienced leaders.
she said during a press conference in Montebello last Tuesday.
Feinstein s stand seemingly is at odds with most voters who according to recent polls favor two ballot propositions that would limit the terms of officeholders.
Just as significant Feinstein has been resisting the broader temptation to "run against Sacramento " a fat political target with its revealing FBI investigation recent corruption convictions and incessant legislative gridlock.
Feinstein a close ally of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D San Francisco) is being careful not to alienate the legislators she hopes to deal with as governor.
Aggressively attacking "Sacramento" and "special interests" words regarded by most lawmakers as euphemisms for themselves would risk she said in an interview.
History shows that although beating up on Sacramento may be popular with voters there inevitably is a price to pay for gubernatorial candidates who do it.
who pushed for political reform and enraged legislators when he ran for governor in 1974 the first post Watergate election.
Van de Kamp paid the price literally earlier this year for proposing Proposition 131 a government ethics initiative with term limits and vowing to "drain the swamp" of political corruption in Sacramento.
Angry legislative leaders used their leverage over bills to dry up Van de Kamp s campaign contributions from special interests particularly trial lawyers who had supported him.
said one former Van de Kamp adviser who asked not to be identified.
This fall the Republican gubernatorial candidate Sen.
Pete Wilson is joining Feinstein in opposing Proposition 131.
He is opposed because the measure also would allow tax dollars to be used to help finance political campaigns.
Wilson has not taken a position on the more stringent term limit measure Proposition 140 sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum.
Taking whacks at the Legislature could gain the gubernatorial candidates a lot of points with voters The Los Angeles Times Poll indicated in its most recent statewide survey.
They also had a basically unfavorable impression of Speaker Brown.
And they overwhelmingly backed the term limit initiatives especially Schabarum s.
But as with Feinstein Wilson s criticism of Sacramento has been relatively mild confined primarily to denouncing the "arrogance" of Democratic leaders for "gerrymandering" legislative districts and assailing liberals for burying crime bills.
said Wilson s press secretary Bill Livingston.
Feinstein s gentle scoldings of Sacramento have been aimed basically at the lame duck Republican governor George Deukmejian.
There is gridlock in the capitol she says because of inertia in the governor s office.
That is not to say the Legislature is faultless let alone ethically pure the former San Francisco mayor will acknowledge if asked.
VOTERS MAY FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS AKIN TO BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE JUST TO GET RIDOF THE RATS.
There is a recurring temptation in American politics to wreak vengeance on one s adversaries by overhauling the political institutions that they dominate.
What usually results from this ill considered radical surgery is that the very people who scheduled the operations end up in the recovery room.
Roosevelt s plan to expand the Supreme Court in 1937 to dilute the votes of conservatives resulted in the creation of an opposing political coalition that lived on after the controversy to plague every subsequent Democratic President.
The Republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would never be another F.
so they pushed through the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms.
The first President to come under the restriction was Dwight D.
Eisenhower a Republican who might very well have won a third term.
The latest institutional patients to be wheeled into the shock trauma unit are the state legislatures.
The quack therapy being performed on them is the imposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve.
18 when Oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly a ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years service.
By itself the term limitation in Oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend setter but similar measures will be voted on in November in California and Colorado.
Eager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year some journalists have seen in the Oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents a manifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the Democrats the party that holds the largest number of legislative seats.
It is rather the kind of minor political tempest that gets highlighted briefly by the media is copied in a few places and then disappears.
It is Republicans naturally enough who seem to be the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation since they have the most to gain at least in the short term from an indiscriminate clean out of the nation s deliberative bodies.
What makes term limitation such a singularly inappropriate tool is the almost total lack of connection between the fancied sins of the lawmakers and the discipline proposed.
The very weakness and vulnerability to corruption that have often plagued state legislatures usually result from the amateurism of lawmakers the quality that term limitation backers now assert as a virtue.
Where state legislators are underpaid have no professional staffs and meet rarely they usually come under the sway of full time governors executive branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists.
Indeed the goal of legislative reformers for the past 50 years has been more professionalism in the state assemblies not less.
By turning out the legislators every 12 years or even worse every six years you pretty much guarantee that those who are elected won t have much of a stake in their jobs.
They will use them as temporary hitching posts on their way to other offices without term limitations.
Not every state lawmaker has his eye on a seat in the U.
But it s a safe bet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if they know that the law will force them out soon.
Their influence over these legislative birds of passage will grow because they will be guaranteed a perennial crop of callow and ignorant lawmakers.
One thing that legislators now have going for them is that they can become conversant with public issues and so challenge if they care to the self serving propaganda of the special interests.
Celebrating along with the lobbyists will be the legislative staffs whose tenure would be unaffected.
These unelected officials are permanent and beyond the reach of voters while the very people who are in some measure accountable will be hustled out of office.
Ultimately what the term limit amounts to is an indictment of citizenship.
It is an admission that the voters are civic imbeciles who cannot discriminate between bad lawmakers and good ones.
Where surgical strikes are needed to eliminate the incompetent or corrupt the term limitation uses carpet bombing in the hope that in the resulting carnage some of the guilty will suffer along with the innocent.
At the most basic level term limitation is just flat out wrongheaded and illogical.
To throw everybody out when all you want to do is throw out the rascals is like burning down your house in order to get rid of the rats.
TERM LIMITS WOULD OUST LAWMAKERS AND A SYSTEM.
Tapping a wellspring of public antipathy to the institutions of government backers of two November ballot measures that would limit terms of officeholders appear on the verge of transforming the face of California politics as few have done before.
If either Proposition 131 or 140 is approved and polls show both leading by wide margins state lawmakers the governor and other state elected officials will for the first time face limits on their tenure in office.
The result say the initiatives sponsors is the Legislature s entrenched leadership ultimately will be swept from office and "lifetime politicians" will be replaced by "citizen legislators.
" Critics don t argue with the popular appeal of the measures anti incumbent message.
A Legislature with few real experts where lawmakers are even more obsessed with moving up and few have the experience and political savvy to resist lobbyists and the empire building of career bureaucrats.
The term limits would result in the biggest upheaval in electoral politics in the state since 1966 when the U.
Supreme Court s landmark one man one vote decision was implemented.
With that ruling large population counties received proportionately more representation in the Legislature bringing in 22 new senators a majority of the 40 member Senate and 33 new lawmakers to the 80 member Assembly.
The move toward term limits also reflects more widespread political unrest spawned by a common message that is being delivered to incumbent officeholders.
said blunt talking Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum chief sponsor of Proposition 140.
Proposition 140 would limit lifetime service in the Assembly to six years in the Senate to eight.
Proposition 131 would force members of each house to move on after 12 consecutive years.
Both measures limit most statewide elected officials to eight years in office but Proposition 131 would allow them to run again after sitting out a term.
Additionally Proposition 131 would provide partial public funding of all state political campaigns paid for out of a taxpayer supported campaign fund.
It imposes limits on campaign contributions and expenditures bans off year campaign fund raising and establishes a special prosecutor s office to pursue public corruption cases.
Proposition 140 would slash the Legislature s operating budget in half forcing massive staff lay offs and would eliminate the legislators retirement system.
Should both initiatives pass term limits would be set by the one getting more votes but all the other provisions of both ballot measures would go into effect.
Opponents of the two constitutional amendments say the measures represent a kind of coup d etat by initiative a flagrant attack on basic democracy that denies voters the right to keep returning to office the most experienced and effective politicians.
Some view passage of either measure as a major step in a movement begun in Oklahoma last month to impose term limits on legislators in all 50 states and eventually on members of Congress.
said Senate President Pro Tem David A.
Roberti (D Los Angeles) a bitter foe of both ballot measures and one of a number of mid term senators who would be forced from office in 1996 if Proposition 140 prevails.
In what is proving to be a roaring battle over term limits both sides in the debate agree that either of the measures would change fundamentally the way politics is conducted in the nation s most populous state.
Under Proposition 140 with its shorter term limits 83 of the politicians who take seats in the Assembly and Senate later this year would be swept from office by 1996.
Lee professor emeritus in political science at UC Berkeley.
" Under both measures the governor attorney general and most other constitutional officers would be held to the eight year limits guaranteeing that no one who wins one of the major offices Nov.
Supporters of both measures reach for a broom when groping for a symbol of their intentions.
The two ballot initiatives have brought together a curious coalition of forces.
those who want more government regulation and those who believe that government has intruded far too much.
Van de Kamp a liberal Democrat as part of his unsuccessful campaign to become governor.
Schabarum the best known author of Proposition 140 is a conservative Republican.
Sensing a groundswell of frustration with the Legislature Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson has also endorsed the initiative.
A recent Los Angeles Times Poll found strong support for both term limit initiatives and deep frustration with how the state Legislature is handling its job.
However most voters with an opinion said their own legislators deserve to be reelected.
The September poll showed 55 of voters supporting Schabarum s Proposition 140 and 28 in opposition.
Proposition 131 was only slightly less popular with 50 saying they would vote for the initiative 34 against it.
Other polls have shown even stronger support for the two measures.
Although Wilson Schabarum and Van de Kamp are veteran politicians supporters of the initiatives for the most part are frustrated outsiders trying to crash a political system that they view as unresponsive.
Their common view is that incumbents have all the advantages when challenged at the polls and that it has become increasingly difficult to oust them.
Some observers believe that the term limit question might have been avoided entirely if earlier attempts to change the way legislative districts are determined through reapportionment had been successful opening the way for more competitive legislative races.
said former Assembly Speaker Bob Monagan (R Tracy).
He said the efforts of were at least partly responsible for strong support for term limits.
There is so little competition in legislative races that in the past three general and primary elections from 1984 through 1988 only five incumbent legislators were defeated at the polls.
In 15 out of 100 races for state Senate and Assembly this year incumbents have no major party challengers and are virtually certain of reelection.
Despite all of that opponents of term limits argue that the natural rate of turnover is quite high.
Nineteen of 40 state senators in office after the 1980 election have since left the Senate.
Put another way exactly half of the 120 lawmakers remain in the same jobs a decade later.
As might be expected the top legislative leaders in both parties rank high in length of service headed by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D San Francisco) with 26 years in the Assembly and Roberti who has served 19 years in the Senate.
Both have remained in office well beyond the average just under 11 years in the Senate and nearly eight years in the Assembly.
Not surprisingly Brown and Roberti along with Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra and Senate GOP Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno are publicly committed to defeating the term limit initiatives arguing vociferously that without experienced legislators to lead the Senate and the Assembly the Legislature would soon be dominated by the governor executive branch bureaucrats and lobbyists.
Although Brown has been actively and openly raising funds for what is expected to be a difficult and expensive campaign his aides have recently been counseling a low profile on the campaign trail conceding that many voters tend to focus their frustrations with the Legislature on the Speaker and his allies.
Brown has been more active than any of the others in raising money to defeat the initiative.
As proponents of the two measures are quick to point out the Democratic Speaker has turned to special interest groups to pay for the opposition campaign.
Brown s initiative campaign committee reported raising 982 489 in the last three months receiving most of the money from corporations unions and political action committees representing groups that regularly lobby the Legislature.
Among the largest contributors were the California Teachers Assn.
RJR Nabisco 25 000 and the California Beer and Wine Wholesalers 20 000.
Proponents of both measures make it clear that legislative leaders are their target.
said California Common Cause director Jim Wheaton now on leave to run the Yes on 131 campaign.
One of the main sponsors of Proposition 140 Lewis K.
Uhler is president of the National Tax Limitation Committee a group seeking a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget.
Uhler has attacked the Democratic leadership of the Legislature people he regards as big spenders.
He believes that faster turnover in the Legislature would improve the chances for "our kind of people" conservative legislators willing to cut government spending.
With passage of either measure California would join 26 other states that now limit the terms governors may serve as well as the many states that also place limits on other statewide offices.
Since statehood 140 years ago only one California governor has ever been elected three times Republican Earl Warren who left in the middle of his final term to become chief justice of the United States.
But other constitutional officers have had more staying power including several in this century who managed to hold on to their elected jobs until they died in office.
At the heart of the debate over the term limits especially as they apply to the Legislature is who would be in charge once the new limits take effect.
Opponents contend that the effect would be to force out of office many of the most effective legislators seasoned lawmakers who are so well entrenched that they can stand up to special interests.
Brown himself at a press briefing two months ago contended that inexperienced legislators would be easy prey for lobbyists.
Consumer activist Ralph Nader who is campaigning around the state in support of Proposition 131 insists that a new crop of legislators would not be hampered by their inexperience.
While proponents of one initiative are sometimes critical of the other for the most part both camps are saving their harshest rhetoric for the Legislature itself.
They recite a similar litany of problems besetting California government.
this year s lengthy budget impasse a widening Capitol corruption scandal that has already led to the conviction of two former state senators and an inability to settle important issues facing the state such as rising insurance rates and increasing traffic congestion.
Although they accuse the legislative leadership and in particular Brown of kowtowing to the special interests the chief backers of both term limit initiatives insist that the Speaker is not their target.
said San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery one of the organizers of the Yes on 131 effort.
But supporters of Propositions 131 and 140 have attempted to capitalize on what they see as widespread distrust of Brown.
Jim Wheaton of the Yes on 131 campaign has attacked Brown as Similarly backers of Proposition 140 ask in a campaign brochure above a picture of Brown at the Assembly rostrum As Speaker of the Assembly Brown is the most powerful member of the Legislature able to appoint the committees that can determine the fate of any piece of legislation.
Because of the power of the office speakers have traditionally been the Legislature s top fund raisers and the principal spokesmen for the majority party in the Assembly.
In Brown s case his flamboyant style and quick sometimes biting wit have made him an especially attractive target for critics of the Legislature.
For now his aides say Brown s best way of fighting back is to remain in the background if he wants to succeed in preserving the Legislature as he knows it.
High court refuses to reinstate California s campaign contribution limits.
10 CANDIDATES SHARPLY DEFINE DIFFERENCES IN 2 TV DEBATES.
Candidates for five Orange County seats in the state Assembly met Thursday in two debates that offered voters some clear distinctions between opponents but little time to explore their views in any depth.
The half hour debates were taped in the studios of KOCE TV Channel 50 at Golden West College and were moderated by Jim Cooper.
featured 58th Assembly District candidates Luanne Pryor a Long Beach public relations executive and Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J.
Mays and 71st District hopefuls Peter Mathews a Cypress College professor and incumbent Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R Cypress).
Mays a Republican and Pryor a Democrat are vying for the seat vacated by outgoing Assemblyman Dennis Brown.
They traded charges that each is susceptible to influence from developers who have contributed to their campaigns.
Pryor said Mays was in the pocket of the Huntington Beach Co.
the largest landowner in that city while Mays pointed out that Pryor took contributions from David Malmuth a major Long Beach developer.
Mathews meanwhile said that legislators are influenced by private special interests and that voters should reject incumbents and Allen agreed that the Legislature is not functioning properly but blamed it on a Democrat dominated power structure that is forcing citizens to legislate by initiative.
When asked about two initiatives on the ballot that would limit legislator s terms Mays Allen and Mathews all said they would support some form of term limits with Mathews also supporting public financing of campaigns.
Pryor said she sees limiting terms as being detrimental to women candidates who are already underrepresented in the Legislature.
candidates in the 67th 69th and 70th districts squared off.
All three are heavily Republican districts and the Democrat challengers are decided underdogs.
Fred Smoller got into a short but heated argument with incumbent John R.
Lewis (R Orange) when Smoller blasted Lewis for his since dismissed indictment on political forgery charges.
Lewis countered by saying that the charges were trumped up by Atty.
John Van de Kamp and other powerful Democrats and were "laughed out of court.
Smoller said that Lewis was wrong that he was "detained" and not arrested.
Meanwhile the Democratic candidate in the 69th District business attorney James Toledano attacked his opponent Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R Huntington Beach) for refusing to debate him one on one during the campaign.
Instead he used his time to remind voters that he is a fiscal conservative who is concerned about keeping taxes low and restricting government growth.
He said he opposes Measure M the county s proposed sales tax increase for transportation improvements but supports construction of additional toll roads.
Toledano said he too opposes Measure M but because it is approach to problems that need a more comprehensive solution.
In the 70th District Democrat Howard Adler said the Republican incumbents and have failed to provide the county with any political leadership.
Gil Ferguson answered that the Democrats in power in Sacramento for the past 37 years are the crooks who have been "sucking this state blind.
" said Ferguson (R Newport Beach) proclaiming his support for Prop.
131 WOULD FUND CAMPAIGNS LIMIT OFFICIALS TERMS.
Charging that escalating campaign costs have made politicians increasingly beholden to well heeled special interests backers of one of two term limit initiatives on the November ballot are calling for a dramatic change in the way elections are financed.
Propositions 131 and 140 seek to overhaul state politics by forcing more turnover of elected representatives.
But the public financing of campaigns called for in Proposition 131 could bring a more immediate change in the political behavior of candidates for state office and the financial contributors on whom they depend.
In place of overwhelming reliance on special interest money Proposition 131 would set up a taxpayer supported fund to pay up to half the costs of a candidate s campaign.
The new rules would apply in every race for elected state office including governor attorney general and all members of the Legislature.
Supporters of Proposition 131 contend that public funding would work hand in hand with the measure s other provisions term limits a ban on non election year fund raising and new restrictions on campaign spending and contributions.
Backers say this combination of reforms seeks to loosen the grip that special interests corporations causes and institutions have had on legislators.
Stern the former general counsel for the Fair Political Practices Commission and a backer of Proposition 131.
Van de Kamp who drew up the initiative as part of his unsuccessful campaign for governor.
But opponents of Proposition 131 argue that the campaign funding provisions would increase the influence of special interest money.
They say that when limits on political committees are reached individual corporate executives could respond by making sizable personal contributions up to 40 000 spread over 40 campaigns.
Less affluent people would not be able to give as generously according to this argument.
Opponents also argue the initiative would give tax money to the campaigns of extremist candidates and that by limiting campaign spending it would restrict free speech.
contends a lengthy dissection of the initiative prepared by Berman and D Agostino Campaigns consultants for the opposition campaign which is backed by legislative leaders and a wide range of special interest groups such as labor unions race tracks trial lawyers and oil companies.
The plan is designed to encourage candidates to look to smaller contributions especially from within their own districts for the money needed to run a campaign.
said Fred Woocher a deputy attorney general who worked with Van de Kamp in drafting Proposition 131.
The measure would allow taxpayers to voluntarily direct 5 of their state income tax returns to the fund for public campaign financing.
That is similar to the federal checkoff system which has provided funding for presidential races since 1976.
Over the past two years 21 of federal taxpayers have directed 1 of their taxes toward the presidential fund.
A similar response rate on state returns would mean 20 million a year for California races.
Each individual contribution to a candidate of up to 250 would be matched by the state fund in varying amounts providing 3 for every 1 donated by a person living within the candidate s district and a dollar for dollar match for donors living outside the district.
No public funds would be made available to match contributions from corporations unions political action committees and political parties.
The measure would require candidates who accept state money to abide by spending limits which would be lifted only if a non participating opponent exceeds the limit.
A candidate for the Assembly who accepted public funds could spend no more than 400 000 for the general election.
A candidate who chose not to accept public financing would be exempt from the spending ceiling.
All candidates whether they accept public funds or not would have to limit the total amount they accept from all corporations unions and PACs.
Any additional money would have to come from individuals at contributions of no more than 1 000 each.
In addition to all these changes the initiative would create a special prosecutor s office to pursue political corruption cases and impose criminal penalties on legislators who try to influence government decisions that might be of personal financial benefit.
The measure would also tighten existing law to prohibit state elected officials from taking any gift of 100 or more and it would extend a recently enacted ban on honorariums as well as the gift limitation to local elected officials.
The rival to Van de Kamp s initiative Proposition 140 sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum would put even more stringent limits on the terms of state elected officials but contains no provision for public financing of campaigns.
Proposition 131 would limit Assembly members and state senators to 12 consecutive years in office.
Proposition 140 would create a six year lifetime limit on service in the Assembly and an eight year limit in the state Senate.
If both measures pass term limits would be set by the one getting more votes but all the other provisions of the initiatives would be enacted including public funding of campaigns.
Supporters of the Schabarum initiative say they simply do not like the use of public money to pay for campaigns under Proposition 131.
Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson who supports Proposition 140 said recently that he could not endorse Proposition 131 Lewis K.
Uhler president of the National Tax Limitation Committee and a co sponsor of Proposition 140 argued that taxpayers When backers of Proposition 131 set out to limit the influence of special interests they had to include public financing because of a 1976 U.
Under that landmark decision the court said that states can only limit campaign spending if the candidates themselves agree voluntarily to do so in exchange for public funding of their campaigns.
Under the Van de Kamp initiative a candidate for governor who chooses to take public money could spend a combined 11.
Up to half of that amount could come from the taxpayer supported fund.
By comparison in the present gubernatorial campaign Republican Pete Wilson had spent 14.
Proponents of the Van de Kamp initiative point out that no candidate for governor whether they accept public funds or not could take contributions from corporations and other "non individual" supporters totaling more than 1.
Stern predicted that the various limits on contributions would give serious candidates for office little choice but to apply for state funds and agree to the spending limits.
Not to do so he said would leave these candidates trailing badly in campaign funds.
In their analysis of Proposition 131 drawn up for opponents political consultants Michael Berman and Carl D Agostino argue that the measure would mean paying out Woocher and other backers argue that the measure contains a number of safeguards to discourage extremist groups such as requiring candidates to raise a significant amount on their own before becoming eligible for matching money.
The Berman D Agostino analysis also argues that various cults and radical groups would be able to take money from individual members draw on the public fund for a 3 for 1 match then kick back the original contribution disguising it for example as salary or consulting fees.
The measure specifically bars a campaign taking public funds from paying money to a donor unless that individual has provided "full and adequate consideration" for the payment.
Opponents predict that public funding will prove the downfall of the Van de Kamp initiative.
That idea has been said Assemblyman Richard L.
Mountjoy (R Monrovia) who is supporting the rival term limit measure.
Supporters point out that voters in 1988 by 53 to 47 approved Proposition 68 which contained public financing for legislative races.
But the electorate gave an even larger mandate to Proposition 73 which specifically prohibited the use of public funds in election campaigns.
Public financing of local campaigns was approved by Los Angeles voters last June to take effect in 1993 but the measure faces court challenges.
Proposition 140 is silent on the subject of public financing of campaigns.
If both initiatives pass the campaign rules contained in the Van de Kamp measure would become law.
6 ballot would among other things limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators.
Proposition 131 would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four year terms state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office.
Proposition 140 would hold Assembly members to six years in office state senators and statewide elected officials to eight.
The Times asked six legislators and legislative specialists.
Mountjoy member of the state Assembly (R Monrovia) first elected in 1978 a former general contractor who has served as mayor and city councilman of Monrovia (1968 76).
The argument that the lobbyists would take advantage of them I believe is not valid.
Term limits would give the people of California more control over the Legislature and the Legislature would be less prone to special interests because legislators would know they are going to be there for six years and they re out.
(Term limits) would stop (politics) from being a professional occupation.
For many members that s all they ve ever done be in the Legislature legislative staff.
I think it will return the Legislature to more of a citizen type legislator.
The Legislature right now is controlled by those people who have a vested interest in legislation.
I came to the Legislature after eight years on the (Monrovia) City Council.
I think that the legislative committee hearings are nothing more than City Council meetings on different subject matters.
I think that what would happen in the Legislature is more expertise coming out of the citizenry.
I think the age bracket would creep up a little more.
Robert Presley state senator (D Riverside) since 1974 formerly a member of the Riverside County Sheriff s Department for 24 years 12 of them as undersheriff.
My guess is that in about 20 years there would be another initiative to change (term limits) because we will have found that (they) didn t work.
The lobbyists are there for a very long time and they become very expert in their fields.
It would become clear rather quickly that you have a bunch of elected amateurs trying to run a very complex complicated system of state government.
We are growing at the rate of three quarters of a million people a year and that alone is hard for people to comprehend.
It is the ethnic mix the cultural diversity all of those things have to be cranked in.
is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think.
And the other thing a lot of people seem to think is that you the governor or you the legislator can get up there and solve these problems tomorrow.
Kurtz director of state services National Conference of State Legislatures.
The most negative and pernicious impact of term limitations will be on the leadership of the Legislature.
They need leaders who have a great deal of experience skill and ability to lead and to get things done so that they avoid the kind of stalemate we have had in Congress in recent years.
But legislatures also need strong committee chairmen and term limits mean that relatively inexperienced people are going to be in leadership and that they are by definition lame ducks from the very beginning.
There has been a national movement that started in California 25 years ago to really strengthen the role of legislatures and to make them co equal branches of government.
things like term limitations which would restrict the power and authority of legislatures are a step backward in that movement.
It would mean that in relative terms the legislatures would cede more power and authority to the executive branch to lobbyists and to legislative staff.
Petracca assistant professor of politics and society UC Irvine.
The national effect would be very impressive because unlike Oklahoma (where voters recently approved a 12 year limit on legislators) which does not have a reputation for being in the vanguard of political change in America California does.
Because it is the largest political state in the country a success for either proposition here is likely to have spinoff moves around the country.
Since states do have the power to amend the Constitution on their own although it is much harder to do it that way it could very well be that the groundswell of support for (this) movement in some key industrial states would lead to not only initiatives in those states to restrict their own state legislative terms but also.
As to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of California a lot of people think that this is a partisan issue.
people would have to become more dependent on the party for funding and for guidance and less dependent on the special interests.
The big problem is that nationally or locally we do not have a culture that encourages and rewards public service for short periods of time.
That is why we created what in effect is a professional elite to govern us.
Antonia Hernandez president of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund.
The Schabarum initiative (Proposition 140 backed by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum) with a six year limit (for Assembly members) would have an adverse effect on the Latino community.
We have begun to look at whether it would violate the Voting Rights Act.
For minorities who do not have a financial base it is usually extremely hard to raise the money.
well financed well organized candidates who are supported by other communities will have a much better chance.
It seems that as we (Latinos) begin to make entries into the political process the rules are beginning to change.
Elected officials are supposed to represent the people who elect them.
If there are constant changes the impact of term limits would be to empower the bureaucracy the people who are not elected and (they) would definitely empower the special interests who have the finances and the ability to assist the bureaucrats.
The first two years you are just finding your way around.
the second two you are just hitting your stride and in the third two years you are on your way out (if 40 passed).
There are a lot of problems with our political process but this is not the solution.
There is some merit to term limits but they have to be done in a way that doesn t unduly strengthen the bureaucracy and others who are not elected.
Jacobson fellow Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences Stanford University.
professor of political science UC San Diego.
The standard argument is that the legislative branch would be weakened.
Information will be held by bureaucrats staff special interests.
I think that is true but what we are overlooking are the perverse incentives we set up.
Instead of worrying about what their constituents think as it gets toward the end of their term legislators are going to be worried about what their next employer thinks possibly in the private sector or in their next constituency which will not necessarily share the same interests as the one that elected them.
If you give someone a job for instance and tell them that no matter how well they do it they will be fired the incentive to do that job well is not there.
Democrat Dick Floyd s Assembly district has a peculiar shape to it like the front half of a horse.
The torso rests awkwardly along Pacific Coast Highway near Wilmington.
The head reaches several miles northwest to around Hawthorne pointed in the general direction of Hollywood Park race track.
I m telling you about this oddly shaped district because it illustrates an important but little discussed side effect of a pair of term limit proposals on the Nov.
District boundaries are drawn by the politicians and for the politicians or to be more precise by and for the politicians in power.
Voter approval of term limits eventually will topple the existing Sacramento power structure.
Depending on your party preference the measures can be described as either boosting Republican efforts to take control of the Legislature or breaking a Democratic stranglehold on the Statehouse.
But I ve talked to political scientists and politicians and they agree that term limit approval would help the GOP win legislative elections.
Dick Floyd s district shows how it would work.
As they began the 1981 legislative reapportionment Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other Democratic powers faced an unpleasant political reality.
While the governor Jerry Brown was Democratic the party s registration edge was shrinking.
And so as politicians do they fell back on the technique devised during the early 19th Century Administration of Massachusetts Gov.
Elbridge Gerry when party leaders gained political advantage by drawing a district in the shape of a salamander.
In Floyd s 53rd District widely separated working class neighborhoods in Carson Gardena Lawndale and Hawthorne were bundled together.
The lines simply followed Democratic registration in a free flow manner creating a district where 60 of the voters would be Democrats.
Rather than a salamander they produced the front end of a horse a fortunate outcome given the alternative.
Contrary to popular belief such gerrymandering doesn t automatically produce victory in California.
That s because the state has an element known as The Disloyal Democrats.
These are Democrat constituents who often don t vote along party lines.
You counter disloyalty and shrinking party registration by finding candidates who appeal to local tastes.
In Floyd the Democrats found someone perfect for this Joe Sixpack district.
Rebellious and irate union man Floyd is the guy who d tell the foreman to take that job and shove it.
For Floyd s also a jokester the kind of legislator who wanders the Assembly floor sharing stories with his colleagues and shouting wisecracks across the room.
As long as he keeps telling stories and telling off the bosses Floyd has a job.
There are a lot of local heroes like Floyd among Southland Democrats.
You can tell the local heroes by the way they always outstrip Democratic presidential candidates in their districts.
Their entrenched presence combined with the gerrymandering gives the Democrats a huge advantage regardless of how the nation might be tilting politically at the time.
So for the Republicans the only way out is to get rid of the locals and everyone else and start fresh.
Republicans compare the present situation to playing football on a field that runs uphill.
Trying to remedy the situation they ve backed voter initiatives to take reapportionment out of the hands of the Legislature.
He could veto the Democrat s once a decade reapportionment bill.
But the Republicans real hope is getting rid of incumbents like Dick Floyd.
That s a strong reason for Republicans to like term limits.
That support was clear last Friday when I was on a panel interviewing Vice President Dan Quayle on a cable talk show.
Quayle invoked the image of the team forced to play uphill.
Asked about the advantages a term limit would have for the GOP he said A level playing field for the Republicans political death for Dick Floyd and quite possibly for the Democrats decades of majority rule.
QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO CANDIDATES AND RETURNED THIS MONTH.
ANSWERS LONGER THAN SPACE ALLOTTED HAVE BEEN EDITED TO FIT THE AVAILABLE SPACE.
Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick children spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs.
I supported the recent bill that would require family leave for larger employers of 25 or more people.
7 cost of living raise for school employees and Gov.
Deukmejian reduced it to 3 placing the difference in an account for special education programs.
7 COLA should go to school districts so that those local districts can spend funds according to their own localized priorities.
Teachers are still underpaid and special programs now are so numerous that they get in the way of the basics.
Proposition 128 the so called "Big Green" initiative on the November ballot seeks to eliminate ozone depleting chemicals by the year 2000 phase out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new developments.
While it is not a perfect piece of legislation it is an ambitious attempt at setting comprehensive environmental policy for California.
Also it is unclear what the full cost will be and how it is to be fully covered.
Proposition 130 on the November ballot would restrict clear cutting of forests allow the sale of 710 million in bonds to preserve ancient redwood forests and provide 32 million to retrain unemployed loggers.
Van de Kamp and Common Cause would limit most statewide elected officials to eight consecutive years in office and senators and Assembly members to 12 years.
Proposition 140 sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum is more stringent limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six in the Assembly.
I agree with former President Reagan that all voters should continue to have the option to support whomever they believe is best representing their interests.
Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes by 0.
5 billion for drug enforcement and treatment anti drug education and prison and jail construction and operation.
The objective is noble but there is so much fiscal waste in Sacramento that eliminating the waste would pay for it.
Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on beer wine and liquor and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse.
Proposition 139 on the November ballot would allow private companies to hire state prison and county jail inmates as laborers.
I supported a more equitable and moderate prison workfare measure in the Legislature last session.
Proposition 139 is not the best approach because it allows prisoners to work off site creating potential security and public safety concerns.
Yes assuming half the compensation would go to defray the costs of running the prisons and jails.
I support the death penalty for drug dealers when it involves the biggest kingpins of the drug underworld who should be held directly responsible for causing so much pain and anguish as a result of peddling their deadly wares.
Yes I support capital punishment for importers and sellers of drugs.
The Legislature and the governor last year successfully beat back the gun lobby to pass landmark gun control measures an effort that resulted in unsuccessful recall attempts being launched against me and some of my colleagues.
I believe the Legislature should now take some time to properly review and evaluate the effectiveness of those measures.
This is not even an issue for government to be concerned about in my opinion.
I have supported and will continue to support measures designed to provide incentives for employers to provide child care.
This is in the best long term interests of the businesses involved because employer sponsored child care has been shown to increase employee morale and productivity as well as reduce absenteeism.
But I would add the strong argument that we all must strive to educate our youth about the perils of drugs in order to reduce the demand for drugs.
The small amount of oil available as well as the fragile nature of the California coastline does not make this source a viable alternative to disrupted Mideast oil.
needs a comprehensive national energy policy to best utilize present resources as well to develop new sources of energy.
Our oil business is in shambles thanks to importation of too much foreign oil.
Let s restrict imports as we have the second biggest oil facility ready to operate at Point Arguello but is hamstrung due to Mickey Mouse style environmental trifles.
Alternative fuels research is fine for the long term but we need oil now not blackmail in the East.
This is an issue of local control best decided at the local level and I will oppose any effort at preemption by the state.
Pollution caused by automobiles necessitates our looking at ways to reduce their use.
We must look to enhanced ride sharing incentives (private and public) and to mass transit to help break our dependence on the automobile.
In order to level the playing field for all potential political candidates and to remove any questions of impropriety at least partial public funding coupled with spending limits should be available.
The public funding must be limited to amounts paid into a special fund by taxpayers on a voluntary basis.
Yes subject to confidentiality controls and my opponent s willingness to do the same.
While much of Ventura County is already connected to state water I support other local purveyors rights to connect to state water if local citizens decide that is most desirable.
I believe we must make every effort to convince the casual drug user as well as the drug dealer to stay away from drugs.

The question being raised by some of Anderson s colleagues on Capitol Hill is at the core of Republican Sanford W.
Kahn s campaign to unseat the 11 term San Pedro Democrat in the Nov.
He cites his rise two years ago to the chairmanship of the House s powerful Public Works and Transportation Committee and his steady success in steering federal port road and rail projects to Los Angeles County.
" But Kahn portrays Anderson as a once vigorous lawmaker no longer up to his job.
He also accuses the congressman of using his power improperly and of losing touch with his district on issues ranging from taxes to term limits.
Anderson he says embodies the trouble with entrenched incumbents.
"Anderson has grown stale " said Kahn 46 a Southern California Gas Co.
Although Anderson draws praise from many of his Washington peers some who work on his committee say advanced age and a 1988 quadruple bypass heart operation have taken their toll.
All those who criticized Anderson declined to be quoted by name with some expressing concern that they might endanger their projects pending before the public works committee.
Anderson and Kahn are staging a rematch in the 32nd Congressional District which includes San Pedro Harbor City Wilmington Lakewood and parts of Long Beach and Downey.
Kahn may be hard pressed to improve on that performance.
Despite having run two years ago he is still not well known in the district and has failed to raise the large amounts of money needed for an aggressive districtwide campaign.
According to the latest federal election figures Anderson has collected more than 350 000 since Jan.
Kahn by contrast collected less than 6 000 in the same period and had only 240 on hand as of Oct.
In some respects the issues in the 32nd District campaign mirror those in congressional races across the country.
Kahn says that on two such issues tax policy and legislative term limits Anderson is "out of sync" with his district.
Kahn opposes any type of tax increase to help ease the federal budget deficit saying Congress should instead freeze spending at fiscal 1990 levels and cut big ticket programs such as agricultural subsidies.
Anderson supports a federal budget bill approved by Congress on Saturday that would boost taxes by 164 billion over the next five years as part of a 490 billion deficit reduction program.
Noting that wealthy taxpayers would be tapped for much of the new revenue he says the package is fairer than a government spending freeze would be.
On legislative term limits Kahn advocates holding House members to five two year terms.
Anderson expresses "serious reservations" about limits arguing that legislators become more effective the longer they serve.
But the most intensely debated issue in the 32nd District campaign is whether Anderson s continued service in Congress is a plus or a minus to his constituents and the country.
Kahn says Anderson has lost his effectiveness.
He points to a recent Washingtonian magazine poll of Capitol Hill staff members that ranked Anderson as "worst committee chairman" in the House.
He also cites grumblings by the committee members themselves.
In interviews with The Times many lawmakers on the public works committee praised Anderson.
But some on the panel Democrats among them said he is often unable to hold his own in policy discussions is overly reliant on his staff and ineffective in advancing the committee s interests in Congress.
Some on the committee say these concerns could prompt House Democrats to take the unusual step of ousting Anderson from the chairman s post in December when they hold their caucus.
Anderson and his supporters attribute such talk to political rivalry not friendly concern.
He points to a recent series of committee hearings he conducted in 11 states over the past three months to assess the country s transportation water and sewage treatment needs.
He acknowledges referring in meetings to note cards prepared by his staff but contends this does not mean he is overly scripted.
Kahn also charges that after years in Washington Anderson has begun blurring the distinction between appropriate and inappropriate uses of power.
He accuses Anderson of intervening improperly four years ago in the chartering of a national bank whose board chairwoman is Lee Anderson the congressman s wife.
Anderson acknowledged last month that he or an aide asked federal regulators about the status of a charter application filed by his wife and other organizers of the Rancho Dominguez Bank of Carson.
But he has denied any impropriety saying the query was the sort of routine service he provides for many constituents.
Anderson contends his continued service in Congress is helping both his legislative district and the country.
He says he is putting his experience on the public works committee to use in assembling a nationwide program to upgrade roads bridges and other infrastructure during the 1990s.
And Anderson says seniority is a main reason he has managed to line up congressional support for Los Angeles area projects including.
Anderson Freeway by the state Legislature) the Metro Rail system and the plan to nearly double Terminal Island s port facilities by the year 2020.

GIVE CONGRESS HORSE RACES NOT DISTRACTED LAME DUCKS.
Many Americans apparently including President Bush believe Congress functions poorly.
Paradoxically members of Congress are reelected at astonishingly high rates (96.
A movement has arisen therefore that aims to limit constitutionally the number of terms an individual can serve.
A majority of the American public the very people whose votes give members of Congress permanent tenure support the movement s goal.
The movement now supported by the President he favors a 12 year limit is unhealthy.
Constitutional amendments are often dangerous because their consequences are unpredictable.
Even good ones add to the bad habit of treating basic political structures as mere inconveniences to be challenged whenever they give temporary irritation.
We should not seriously consider amendments unless they address a deep and evident need that we cannot meet through ordinary political action.
It is not obvious that these benefits are simply outweighed by increased possibilities for lethargy and corruption.
In part we fear that our congressional representatives are not really being elected at all not that they are being elected too often.
Increasing evidence suggests that the advantages of incumbency are so formidable that we have little choice during elections.
The problem is too little competition not too much longevity and the potential arrogance resulting from job security that even a civil servant would envy.
Campaign finance reform must become reality.
Reforms would reduce the effects of narrowly focused and irresponsible political action committees and increase the influence of parties and local residents.
The opportunity to fight elections through a sensible combination of principled debate and local interest would be increased.
We should pay more attention to the way the states propose to "redistrict" following this year s census.
Fewer gerrymandered congressional districts might have a salutary effect on congressional competition and honest representation.
Congress could substantially reform its franking privilege a device that peppers constituents with thousands of pieces of propaganda thinly disguised as information.
There was much talk of this last year but the franking budget remains too large.
Finally if Congress could discipline itself by following serious rules for debate and legislation considering all measures and amendments through open discussions and reduce its staff our legislators would be forced to rely more on their own wit judgment and principles.
This would also allow citizens to see what their representatives are really made of and stand for.
A term limitation amendment would do little to increase electoral competition but would have several harmful consequences.
One is that the number of lame ducks would increase.
More certain is the harmful effect that such an amendment would have on Washington s power structure.
In a government where experience often translates into dominance most neophyte congressmen would be at the mercy of experienced staff.
In fact congressional staff members would not be the only unelected officials to benefit from this amendment.
bureaucrats would also rush in where members of Congress were ill equipped to tread.
The result in short would be that almost everyone in Washington with the desire to exercise more power would be better able to do so except of course those elected for that purpose.
Another unwelcome consequence of this amendment would be unnecessary restriction of democratic choice.
American political institutions are based on the principle of consent and consent in large part means choice in the voting booth.
Choice indeed is often and properly "structured" (that is restricted) as through the Electoral College.
This is done to encourage citizens to choose wisely.
An amendment of this sort also restricts democratic choice in a more subtle way by making a career of public service less attractive.
Men of potential public excellence the "men of parts" who were predisposed not to enter our public life as Toqueville observed might be even less likely to enter if their opportunity for achievement and renown were curtailed.
