19890203000000000	THE STATE; POLICE UNION SUES SAN JOSE. The San Jose police officers' union has filed suit against the city, charging that inadequate staffing contributed to the shooting death of a police officer by a crazed gunman last month. "The situation probably would have been resolved if there had been two officers there," said Carm Grande, president of San Jose Police Officers' Assn. Officer Gene Simpson, 45, was killed Jan. 20 after he responded alone to a call that led to a confrontation with a mentally unstable suspect outside a downtown doughnut shop. After overpowering Simpson, the suspect used the officer's .357 Magnum service revolver to shoot him in the head.
19890221000000000	JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN BOMB DEATHS OF 2 OFFICERS. Jury selection will begin today in the murder trial of a North Hollywood makeup artist, in which the defense says it will claim that two Los Angeles police bomb experts caused their own deaths in trying to dismantle a bomb found in the defendant's garage. The pipe bomb, one of two that police found in the home of Donald Lee Morse, exploded with what one investigator described as "a terrific force," instantly killing the two officers. The 39-year-old Morse is charged with two counts of murder and two counts of possessing explosives in the Feb. 8, 1986, deaths of Detective Arleigh McCree, 46, then commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and Officer Ronald Ball, 43. If convicted in the San Fernando Superior Court case, Morse, a film and television makeup artist, could be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris said Superior Court Judge John H. Major "appears to have sided with me" in ruling on pretrial motions about the admissibility of evidence of "alleged negligence by the victims." Defense attorney Bernard J. Rosen agreed that Major has indicated that he will not allow such evidence to be introduced. "But this is sort of a unique case for which there aren't any good precedents," Rosen said. "I expect that we won't know the judge's final ruling until the witnesses are on the stand and I ask my questions and Norris makes his objections." Los Angeles police went to Morse's home to search for a pistol that had been used four days earlier in the shooting of an official of the Makeup Artists and Hairstylists Union Local 706, of which Morse was a member. The gun was not found, and Morse was not charged in the shooting. While conducting the search, officers found two bombs and summoned the police bomb squad. McCree and Ball dismantled one bomb, but were killed when they set off the second one while trying to defuse it. At Morse's preliminary hearing in September, 1986, police testified that the defendant denied any knowledge of the bombs when they were discovered. Prosecutors argued that as a result, Morse contributed to the officers' deaths by withholding information that could have helped the officers defuse the bombs. Norris contends that the prosecution need not show that Morse intended to kill the officers to obtain a murder conviction, only that he possessed an illegal lethal weapon that had no use other than to kill. At the hearing, police experts said Morse's fingerprints were found on several items surrounding the bombs and that explosive powder, batteries, tape, electrical wires and other items used to manufacture bombs were in the garage. Also, an estranged in-law testified that Morse had threatened to have him blown up in his car shortly before the bombs were found. Since the preliminary hearing, the case has been continued repeatedly, first at the behest of defense attorney Pierpont M. Laidley, who said he needed time to interview expert witnesses. Major removed Laidley from the case 14 months ago when the attorney asked for more money to prepare the defense. Since then, Morse's trial has been postponed, first while Rosen studied the case and more recently because he became involved in another murder trial. Morse has been in County Jail without bail since the officers were killed.
19890222000000000	L.A. MAN FOUND GUILTY OF HELPING TO PLOT DEATH OF POLICE DETECTIVE. A man who helped plan the 1985 revenge slaying of a Los Angeles police detective was acquitted of first-degree murder Tuesday but was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. Voltaire Alphonse Williams, 25, of Los Angeles is scheduled to be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz on March 27. A Superior Court jury convicted Williams of helping plan the Halloween, 1985, revenge slaying of Detective Thomas C. Williams, killed in a volley of gunfire as he picked up his 6-year-old son from a Canoga Park day-care center. The child escaped injury. Voltaire Williams is not related to the slain officer. Two other men, Daniel Jenkins, 33, and Ruben Antonio Moss, 26, were convicted earlier in the ambush killing. In October, Jenkins was sentenced to die in the gas chamber; Moss was sentenced to life in prison in December. Jenkins, a North Hollywood limousine company owner, had plotted to have the detective killed to prevent him from testifying in a robbery trial in which Jenkins was the defendant, according to testimony. But the plan to kill the detective did not work out and he testified, authorities said. Jenkins, who was convicted of robbery the day after the slaying, killed the officer in retaliation for his testimony, prosecutors said. The jury deliberated 2 1/2 days before reaching the verdict against Voltaire Williams. It is continuing to consider the fate of co-defendants Duane Moody, 31, and Reecy Clem Cooper, 34, each charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Defense attorneys have said the three men did not know each other. Prosecutors accused Voltaire Williams of meeting with Daniel Jenkins and another man on Oct. 24, 1985, at a Reseda skating rink to plan the killing. However, Williams' attorney, Lewis Watnick, said his client, an aspiring boxer, initially agreed to help Jenkins kill the officer but backed out. Watnick said Voltaire Williams was in Oakland at the time of the killing. "He gave back the gun and the gloves six days before the murder took place," Watnick said, recalling witnesses' testimony during the 10-week-long trial. "He was going to do it, but then he couldn't." Watnick and Charles Lloyd, who also represented Williams, said they were not pleased with the verdict on the conspiracy charge and plan to appeal. Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard L. Jenkins said: "We're pleased. We think the verdict was supported by the evidence." The prosecutor disputed the claim that Voltaire Williams had backed out of the conspiracy but agreed that he had been out of town when the shooting occurred.
19890223000000000	NATION; DEATH SENTENCE VOIDED OVER BIBLE. A federal judge has overturned a condemned murderer's death sentence because the jury that convicted him 10 years ago asked for a Bible during deliberations, court officials said today. In overturning the sentence of Brandon Jones, 31, who was convicted of killing a policeman during a service-station robbery, U.S. District Judge Charles Moye ruled that the Cobb County jury "had a duty to apply the law of the state of Georgia . . . not its own interpretation of the law or its own interpretation of precepts of the Bible." The state attorney general's office is now considering settling for a life sentence for Jones.
19890228000000000	DEATH SENTENCE STANDS FOR POLICEMAN'S KILLER. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to set aside the death sentence of John G. Brown, convicted in 1982 of murdering Garden Grove Police Officer Donald Reed, 27. Brown killed Reed during a June 7, 1980, shoot-out at the Cripple Creek Saloon in Garden Grove when Reed tried to serve him with an arrest warrant. The officer was shot once in the chest and died shortly afterward. According to police testimony, when Brown saw Reed and two reserve officers enter the bar, he rose from his table and ran toward the building's rear door. At the door he pulled a .22-caliber automatic pistol from his jacket and began firing. After spraying bullets throughout the barroom, Brown fled on foot. Sheriff's deputies found him a few blocks away hiding in bushes. Reserve Officer Glen Overly, 21, was wounded in the chest, abdomen and hand, and Reserve Office Dwight Henninger, 20, was hit in the upper arm. Two customers, John Terzia and William McKinney, also were wounded during the shooting spree. At the time of the shooting, Brown was being sought on warrants for suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and suspicion of selling marijuana, officials said. During his trial in Orange County Superior Court, Brown testified that he couldn't remember the shooting because amphetamines he had been taking caused a memory lapse. When Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown asked him why his fingerprints were found on the pistol used in the shooting, Brown answered: "My fingerprints probably are on 1,000 guns in Orange County." Brown's conviction received considerable attention in August when it was heard by the California Supreme Court. Prosecutors had asked the justices to adopt a new, less-stringent standard in determining whether errors had been committed during the appellate process. The jurists refused that request and upheld the death sentences of Brown and two other killers.
19890328000000000	METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; ADULT TRIAL ORDERED FOR GIRL IN SLAYING. A 17-year-old girl was ordered Monday to be prosecuted as an adult on charges that she and her gang member boyfriend shot a police officer to death last September. Compton Juvenile Court Judge Rose Hom found that Raylene Brooks, 17, was unsuitable to be prosecuted as a juvenile. The district attorney's office will refile the case against her in Municipal Court. If convicted as an adult, Brooks could face life in prison. Her boyfriend, Kirkton P. Moore, 27, faces a possible death sentence if convicted at his pending trial. The two are charged with killing Los Angeles Police Officer Daniel Pratt after a drive-by shooting in Southwest Los Angeles on Sept. 3. They fled Los Angeles after the shooting but surrendered to a Los Angeles television reporter in Las Vegas following an Oct. 23 broadcast of a segment about the case on the TV series "America's Most Wanted."
19890404000000000	LOCAL; N. HOLLYWOOD MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER IN OFFICERS' BOMB DEATHS. A North Hollywood makeup man was convicted today of the murders of two police demolitions experts who were killed when a pipe bomb exploded as they were trying to dismantle it. A Superior Court jury, after only hours of deliberation, found Donald Morse guilty of two counts each of first-degree murder and possessing explosives. Morse, 39, was also convicted of special circumstance allegations that would have qualified him for the death penalty, but the district attorney's office had decided not to seek a death sentence against him. Morse will be sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison without parole May 3. Detective Arleigh McCree, 46, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and squad veteran Ron Ball, 43, were killed Feb. 8, 1986, as they tried to defuse two pipe bombs found in Morse's North Hollywood garage.
19900406000000000	FOR SOME OF THE ACTORS, MOVIE ABOUT OFFICER'S DEATH IS HAUNTINGLY REAL. Masih Modani, surrounded by a film crew at an Inglewood street corner, was experiencing for the third time the nightmarish day in which a .44 magnum was put to his head, his car and money were taken and a police officer died at his side. The actual event unfolded on March 31, 1988, when Sgt. George Aguilar picked up Modani, a gas station money courier, at the robbery scene and began chasing the suspects. Modani was in the passenger seat of Aguilar's unmarked car when Aguilar -- the first Inglewood police officer ever killed in the line of duty -- cried out, "I've been shot!" Last year, Modani relived that day during months of testimony at the trials of the defendants. From the witness stand, he described again and again the holdup, the chase and Aguilar's fateful cry. Earlier this week, Modani found himself back at the corner of La Brea Avenue and Arbor Vitae Street where Aguilar met his death. Once again, Modani rode in a speeding Trans Am. Once again, he heard shots ring out. This time, however, a director standing in the middle of the intersection yelled, "Cut!" The chase ended. The fleeing suspects obediently turned around. A feature-length documentary is being filmed in Inglewood about Aguilar, a Mexican immigrant who rose from a tough East Los Angeles street gang member to a respected law officer. Produced by Martin Green and Glenn Bruce, the film is titled after Aguilar's police code name, "Victor One," which he had called out frantically over the radio during the chase. Bruce, who wrote the film, said a portion of the profits will go to a trust fund for Aguilar's 6-year-old son and other money will be used for police anti-drug and gang programs. What makes the movie unusual, Bruce said, is that Modani, the courier who was robbed, and the original police officers who responded to the scene will play themselves in the re-creation. Actors are portraying Aguilar and the five accomplices, four of whom are serving sentences for murder. The fifth killed himself. "Police movies are made all the time, but cops notice the inaccuracies," said Inglewood Lt. William Brown, a technical adviser for the film. "We're trying to be as accurate in this as possible. Whenever possible, we're using the actual locations, the actual people. This is the way it happened." The documentary mixes interviews with Aguilar's colleagues and re-enactments of the events leading up to his death. It portrays Aguilar as an aggressive officer who worked on the narcotics and SWAT teams, a humorous man who performed imitations of Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd at police headquarters and an adventurer who loved sky-diving and cross-country bike racing. The independently financed film, produced by Green's M & S Entertainment, has not yet been sold, but the producers are aiming for cable television and foreign venues, especially in Spanish-speaking markets. The Inglewood Police Department had begun work on an in-house training film on Aguilar's death when Green heard the story and suggested that the police team up with his movie company. Officers have volunteered their time as supporting cast members. Modani called the filming a hair-raising experience. "I know the real thing isn't happening, but I'm reliving every feeling and emotion I had at that point." Fellow police officers who responded to Aguilar's desperate calls that day have had to re-create scenes they say they have replayed in their minds repeatedly since their colleague's death. During filming last week, one scene was cut short when a police officer stared in shock at an actor's artificially bloodied body instead of following the director's instructions and rushing forward to pull him from the wreck. "I think this film is a catharsis," Brown said. "George was someone special. We want people to be aware how much we loved him. With this movie, something good is going to come from something bad." Officer William Cross, one of those who pulled Aguilar from his car and took him to the hospital on that day in 1988, said the filming has captured the drama of the event. He said Danny Trejo, who portrays Aguilar, is the spit and image of the fallen sergeant. "It's really traumatic," Cross said. "I start dredging up feelings like, 'Why did it happen to a guy like George?' " Trejo, who has appeared in "Lock Up" and "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story," said he notices the emotional looks officers give him on and off camera. "I try to stay on the sidelines," he said. "When Aguilar's old friends see me, a lot of them get choked up and turn away."
19890426000000000	CITY HONORS OFFICER SHOT FATALLY IN '83. Flags at Los Angeles City Hall were flown at half staff Tuesday in honor of a police officer who was mortally wounded more than five years ago -- a shooting that paralyzed him and placed him on a slow path toward death. Retired Los Angeles Detective Norman R. Eckles, 42, died Thursday at Daniel Freemen Memorial Hospital. The cause of death, the county coroner's office said, was "acute and chronic" infections related to a bullet wound that he suffered while trying to serve a narcotics search warrant in South-Central Los Angeles on Dec. 1, 1983. The coroner's office now lists Eckles as a homicide victim. His assailant, however, will not face a new charge of murder. Eckles, in essence, outlived the statute of limitations for murder. Sandy Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, explained that the law requires that death occur within three years and a day of "the fatal stroke" for murder charges to be filed. Eckles' assailant, Edwin P. Donelson, is serving a 22-year term at Tehachapi state prison. He was convicted in 1985 of two counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter, two counts of assault on a peace officer and one count of assault with a firearm. Donelson also inflicted lesser wounds on another police detective and a passer-by. Donelson opened fired when Eckles and another officer, identifying themselves as police officers, tried to enter Donelson's apartment in a surprise predawn raid. Eckles' partner tried to force the door open and Eckles broke a window "as a diversionary tactic," he said in a 1984 interview. At Donelson's trial, Eckles testified: "Everybody was screaming 'Police!' I know I said 'Police, we have a search warrant' . . . at least twice. . . . I heard a shot. The next thing I knew, I was on the ground."  Shot Missed Vest Eckles was wearing a bullet-proof vest, but the bullet entered from the side, beneath his right armpit and lodged in his spine. The wound immobilized him from the chest down, forcing him to take a disability retirement. He took 20 different medications to deal with constant pain, said Eckles' wife, Cynthia. Even so, Eckles remained active in law enforcement. From his wheelchair, the former narcotics detective testified frequently in court as an expert on narcotics cases. Eckles also served as a police consultant, lecturing officers on "safety and survival," Los Angeles police spokesman Bill Frio said. Three weeks after the shooting, Eckles said in a hospital room interview: "I used to think a badge would protect me. I used to think the badge covered my whole body, but it was a little short that morning."  'My Saddest Day' Several months later, upon his retirement, Eckles said: "This is the saddest day of my life -- I don't want to retire." Eckles, who lived in Upland, is survived by his wife, daughters Tracy Lynn Paulik and Tammy Eckles, son Norman J. Eckles and three grandchildren. "He was a policeman until the day he died," his wife said in a statement released by police officials. "He loved the LAPD. It was always important to him." Full police rites are planned for 10 a.m. today at the First Baptist Church, 601 N. Garey Ave. in Pomona. Interment will be at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Covina.
19890427000000000	PLOTTER IN AMBUSH KILLING OF DETECTIVE GETS 25 YEARS TO LIFE. A Los Angeles man who helped plot the ambush slaying of a Los Angeles police detective was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison Wednesday in Van Nuys Superior Court. Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz imposed the penalty on Voltaire Alphonse Williams, 26, who was convicted Feb. 21 of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Detective Thomas C. Williams, 40. The same jury acquitted Williams, who is no relation to the late police officer, of first-degree murder. The detective died on Halloween, 1985, in a volley of gunfire as he picked up his 6-year-old son from a Canoga Park church school. The child was not injured. Four other men were tried in the killing. In October, Daniel Jenkins, 33, a North Hollywood limousine driver convicted of masterminding the plot to kill Thomas Williams, was sentenced to die in the gas chamber. The detective was gunned down just hours after he had testified against Jenkins in a robbery trial. Ruben Antonio Moss, 26, described as Jenkins' "loyal lieutenant," also was convicted of first-degree murder in the officer's death. In December, he was sentenced to life in prison. Last month, Reecy Clem Cooper, 34, was acquitted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. On Monday, the district attorney's office announced that it will retry Duane Moody, 30, for murder in the officer's death. A jury acquitted Moody of conspiracy to commit murder last month but deadlocked on the murder charge against him. During the 10-week trial, Voltaire Williams, an aspiring boxer, admitted to meeting with Jenkins on Oct. 24, 1985, to plan the officer's slaying. But his attorney, Lewis Watnick, said his client initially agreed to help Jenkins kill the detective but backed out.  'Gave Back the Gun' "He gave back the gun and the gloves six days before the murder took place," Watnick said after Williams was convicted. He said Williams decided he could not morally go through with the killing. Watnick said his client was in Oakland at the time of the killing. Prosecutors disputed the claim that Williams had backed out of the conspiracy but agreed that he had been out of town when the shooting occurred. Watnick alleged Wednesday that Jenkins plans to have Williams killed and asked that he be imprisoned in a different institution than Jenkins. The judge agreed to note Watnick's request on the sentencing order. The officer's wife, Norma, and his daughter, Susan, were in court for the sentencing. Williams will be eligible for parole in about 17 years, authorities said.
19890504000000000	LIFE TERM; MAKEUP ARTIST SENTENCED IN 2 BOMB DEATHS. A North Hollywood makeup artist was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 1986 deaths of two Los Angeles Police Department explosives experts. Donald Morse, 39, was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major. Morse was convicted April 3 of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of possessing explosives in the deaths of the officers, who were killed while trying to dismantle a pipe bomb at his home. Morse also was convicted of special-circumstance allegations that would have qualified him for the death penalty. But the district attorney's office decided not to seek such a sentence. Killed in the explosion Feb. 8, 1986, were Detective Arleigh McCree, 46, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and Officer Ronald Ball, 43. The officers were the first Los Angeles bomb squad members to be killed in the line of duty. Before his sentencing Wednesday, Morse was allowed to make a brief statement to the court.  Statement to Court "I have been accused and convicted of something I have not done," Morse said, holding up a Bible. "I can't think of any reason I would hurt anyone. In my heart and conscience, I am clear that I am not a murderer." Morse, dressed in a dark gray suit, said he brought the Bible to court because "this is the book I try to live by, to respect others by." Morse appeared calm moments later when Major pronounced the sentence. Afterward, Edie McCree, the detective's widow, said she is comfortable with the penalty imposed on Morse. She said she was not surprised by Morse's statement in court. "What else can he say? The evidence showed that he did it." Morse's attorney, Bernard J. Rosen, said his client will appeal. Rosen said Major erred when he refused to allow the introduction of evidence suggesting that the officers were negligent and caused their own deaths. Major ruled that because the bomb was an illegal and deadly device, its possession was at least a contributing factor in the officers' deaths. Alvin Morse, the defendant's 38-year-old brother, who lived with him at the time of the blast, said his brother could not get a fair trial because the "judge led the jury in the direction he wanted them to go." Alvin Morse said he and his brother had no knowledge of the bombs found in the garage of the North Hollywood home they shared.  Searching for Pistol Police said they went to Morse's home to search for a pistol used four days earlier to shoot an official of the Makeup Artists and Hair Stylists Union Local 706, of which Morse was a member. The gun was not found, and Morse was not charged in the shooting. While searching the defendant's garage, officers found two pipe bombs and summoned McCree and Ball. The two dismantled one bomb, but were killed while trying to defuse the second. During the trial, police testified that Morse denied any knowledge of the bombs when they were discovered. Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris argued that as a result, Morse contributed to the officer's deaths by withholding information that could have helped the officers defuse the devices. Police experts testified that Morse's fingerprints were found on several items surrounding the bombs and that explosive powder, batteries, tape and electrical wires used in the manufacture of bombs were in the garage and in the house. They also testified that the defendant's fingerprints were found on a copy of a bomb-making manual found in his library.
19890510000000000	ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE; CEREMONY TO HONOR POLICE WHO LOST LIVES. A memorial ceremony will be held Monday in Santa Ana for three Orange County police officers who have died in the line of duty within the past year, Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said. Three plaques commemorating Seal Beach Police Officer Edward William Clavell Jr., Anaheim Motorcycle Officer Robert T. Roulston and Sheriff's Deputy Mark Tonkin will be added to the 25 plaques already on the memorial, Olson said. Each plaque honors an officer who has died in the line of duty since 1889. Clavell, 31, died in a chase last August. Roulston, 38, died in a motorcycle accident last October, and Tonkin, 31, died during the same month in a helicopter crash near the Mexican border while on a drug interdiction mission. The ceremony will be held at 11 a.m. on the Plaza of the Flags at the Civic Center in Santa Ana. Best-selling author and former police officer Joseph Wambaugh will be the keynote speaker.
19900515000000000	MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO LESSER CHARGES IN OFFICER'S SLAYING. One of two defendants in the 1987 fatal shooting of a Los Angeles police officer in Sylmar pleaded guilty to cocaine-selling and assault charges Monday, but prosecutors decided to drop the murder charge, saying the case against him was shaky. Thomas Lee Mixon, 21, was being prosecuted for the June, 22, 1987, shooting death of Officer James H. Pagliotti on the theory that he and the other defendant took part in a drug-selling conspiracy that led to the officer's death. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan M. Speer said Monday that evidence in the case did not demonstrate that Mixon and co-defendant Louis Belvin Jr., 20, were engaged in such a conspiracy at the time of the shooting. Mixon had admitted to investigators that he and Belvin -- who authorities said were both South-Central Los Angeles gang members -- had come to Sylmar that day to sell drugs, but no drugs were recovered from them after the shooting, Speer said. Mixon also did not fire the fatal shots and was standing a half block away from where the shooting took place in the Sylmar Square area, she said. "We're going to concentrate our efforts on the shooter," Speer said, referring to Belvin, who she said was "the guy who was really responsible." Pagliotti was killed in a gun battle after confronting Mixon and Belvin in the belief they were dealing drugs, authorities said. Prosecutors said it was Belvin who opened fire on the plainclothes officer, who returned fire and took cover behind his car. The car rolled forward, however, exposing Pagliotti, who was then shot in the chest. Pagliotti, 28, had been a police officer 5 years. Belvin is awaiting trial on a murder charge. He was 17 years old at the time of the shooting but is being tried as an adult. Mixon's attorney, Robert D. Rentzer, said proving a murder based on a conspiracy would have been especially difficult because Mixon and Belvin did not know each other particularly well. "Logically, it's really reaching," Rentzer said. Prosecutors also were reluctant to spend the time and effort that would have been required to bring Mixon to trial on a charge they believed tenuous, Speer said. Mixon and Belvin would have had to be tried separately, she said. After pleading guilty to the lesser charges on Monday, Mixon faces a maximum sentence of eight years and four months in prison when he is sentenced June 8 in San Fernando Superior Court. Speer said she will seek the maximum sentence. In addition to the charge of selling cocaine, Mixon admitted Monday to an assault that was not related to the shooting of the police officer. Shortly before the shooting, Mixon beat up a man who had come to the area to buy drugs, Speer said.
19900518000000000	ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; A SERVICE FOR OFFICERS SLAIN ON JOB. For Sgt. Paul McInerny, Thursday's memorial service honoring Garden Grove police officers killed in the line of duty held a special significance. Almost 10 years ago, McInerny, Officer Donald Reed and two reserve officers went to the Cripple Creek Bar to arrest a narcotics suspect. The incident turned violent when the suspect pulled out a semiautomatic handgun and opened fire, killing Reed and wounding the two reserve officers and two customers. McInerny was not hurt. "A whole bunch of things went through my head," McInerny said. "You're the only officer who walks away unhurt, and you start to wonder why." Surrounded by honor guards and four American flags, McInerny told the stories of Reed and three other police officers lost in the line of duty. Most who attended the third annual ceremony in front of the Garden Grove Police Department were relatives, colleagues or friends. "By being here, you give the police officers today a lift," McInerny told the group of about 100 people. The feeling was reflected among the family members of the three other officers who attended the ceremony. "I'm very proud," said Garden Grove resident Helen Rose Wharton, whose husband, reserve Officer Andy Reese, was killed in 1970 when he was struck by a car as he directed traffic during Garden Grove's Strawberry Festival Parade. Also at the ceremony was Lori Rainford, whose husband, Michael Rainford, was killed in 1980 when he was struck by a drunk driver as he was issuing a citation to another motorist on a ramp leading to the Garden Grove Freeway. "It's real hard," Lori Rainford said. "It makes you feel that people do remember -- they don't forget." She attended the ceremony with her daughter, Melissa, 7, and son, Michael, 9. She was pregnant with Michael when her husband was killed. "It's nice to have these kind of services so he knows," she said. "He has a lot of pictures around the house. He knows a lot of guys around the department." Police Chief John Robertson unveiled a new plaque to honor the officers, which will be placed on stone markers bearing each of their names. "These people made the ultimate sacrifice," Robertson said. "As long as there's a Garden Grove, no one's going to forget that." Robertson's awareness of the dangers of police work came early in his life. His father, Ed, was the best friend of Sgt. Myron Trapp when both were among the first officers to join the Garden Grove Police Department in the late 1950s. In 1959, when John Robertson was only 7, Trapp was shot and killed in the line of duty. After the ceremony, John Robertson told Trapp's mother, Ruth Cawthon, 82, of Costa Mesa, that he remembered his father going to Trapp's grave every year to remember the all the good times they had. "There's a strong tie between police officers," said Trapp's brother, Harold, 67. "You kind of unite to help tolerate the pressure. . . . It's like a giant brotherhood." ED JOHNSON
19890520000000000	PHYSICIAN ACQUITTED IN TRAFFIC DEATH OF MOTORCYCLE OFFICER. A jury on Friday acquitted Diamond Bar physician Steven Earl Davis of vehicular manslaughter in last year's traffic death of an Anaheim motorcycle officer near Anaheim Stadium. Municipal Court jurors in Fullerton, who spent 2 weeks listening to what one attorney described as "very emotional testimony," took only 7 hours before finding Davis not guilty of causing the Oct. 16, 1988, collision that killed Officer Robert T. Roulston, 38. Roulston had been traveling east on his motorcycle on Katella Avenue when Davis' car made a left turn in front of him into a parking lot at Anaheim Stadium. Davis, 29, who works part time as a staff physician at the stadium, began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation "almost immediately" after the collision, said his attorney, Paul Meyer. Davis was turning into the lot at the time fans were arriving for a Los Angeles Rams football game. "For 30 minutes Dr. Davis tried to save his life, which made this a very emotional trial because the doctor was not only involved in the collision but also tried to save the officer's life," Meyer said. Meyer said the case focused on whether Davis improperly turned in front of the officer's motorcycle or whether the officer failed to yield to Davis' car. Also, part of the evidence showed that Roulston was traveling 50 m.p.h., in excess of a safe speed on Katella, Meyer said. "One witness described the officer as 'accelerating,' " Meyer said, "just before the collision." Davis, reached at his office, declined to comment on the jury's decision. The California Highway Patrol investigated the accident and referred its report to the Orange County district attorney's office, which decided to file a charge against Davis. Anaheim police officials declined to comment on the acquittal until the trial is reviewed with the prosecutor. Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Park could not be reached for comment. Roulston's widow, Deborah, an Anaheim police dispatcher, was on duty the day her husband died and did not know that her husband was involved when she sent paramedics and an ambulance to the scene of the accident. This week, she attended a ceremony honoring her husband, one of three police officers killed in the line of duty last year in Orange County.
19900619000000000	ARKANSAS HAS 1ST EXECUTION IN 26 YEARS. A convicted killer was put to death in the electric chair Monday night in the state's first execution in 26 years. John Edward Swindler, 46, a husky, red-faced native of Columbia, S.C., was sentenced to die for the 1976 shooting death of Randy Basnett, 30, a police officer in Ft. Smith, Ark. He was strapped into a wooden chair and subjected to 2,300 volts of electricity at 9:02 p.m. He was declared dead at 9:05 p.m. Swindler, who had also been convicted of killing two teen-agers in South Carolina and was charged with killing a Pennsylvania student in Florida, was put to death at the state's Cummins Prison Unit about 20 miles southeast of Pine Bluff.
19900619000000000	CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; WEST SACRAMENTO; OFFICER, GUNMAN KILLED IN SHOOT-OUT. A police officer was fatally shot and a man was killed when drug investigators raided a home in the rural Yolo County community of Madison. Officer Jim McKnight, 39, who died of a head wound at a Sacramento hospital, was the first West Sacramento officer killed in the line of duty since the city's incorporation two years ago. Police said Luis Orosco, 41, described by relatives as mentally handicapped, was killed after he barricaded himself in a back bedroom and shot it out with officers. No drugs were found in the home, one of four raided simultaneously. At two other locations, officers arrested six people, confiscated firearms and seized about a pound of cocaine.
19900622000000000	OFFICER'S TALENTS DISTINGUISHED HIM AND PUT HIM IN DANGER. Tommy De La Rosa, the Fullerton police officer killed Thursday during an undercover operation, was a model narcotics officer, according to those who knew him. He was friendly, outgoing, experienced and cautious. But the talents that set De La Rosa apart also placed him in danger. As a bilingual officer able to easily assume the identities of drug dealers of many nationalities, De La Rosa was usually the one who made contacts with drug suspects, Fullerton Police Lt. Bud Lathrop said. And he was the one who led the way in Thursday's drug bust, during which he was fatally wounded in an ambush. De La Rosa, 43, a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, had worked undercover narcotics for the past four or five years and was well-respected by his peers, Lathrop said. Married with four children, De La Rosa was the recipient of several awards, one of them as Officer of the Year, bestowed by the Orange County Latino Peace Officers Assn. in 1989. "Ironically, I ran into the guy who's the president of the Latino Peace Officers Assn. today (Thursday, prior to the ambush)," Lathrop said. "Rudy (Sanchez) told me there was going to be another awards banquet in August, and I said, 'Are you going to give Tommy another award?' and we kind of laughed about it." Sanchez said he was shocked when he learned of De La Rosa's death at the association's board meeting Thursday night. "It was a real shocker," Sanchez said. "We kidded around, but we didn't think this would ever happen." Sanchez said those who knew De La Rosa called him "the man with two hats." "He could be a Puerto Rican one day, a Columbian the next, a Mexican the next. He was extremely talented," Sanchez said. "And he was always there to joke. If somebody was down, he was always there to help out. He fit the part of undercover work, like what you see in the movies." The Fullerton undercover narcotics squad De La Rosa belonged to is a five-member team that has won numerous awards for its aggressive work. The team has taken investigations as far north as San Francisco and as far south as the Mexican border.
19900623000000000	OFFICER SLAYING UNDERLINES GROWING RISK IN DRUG WAR. Thursday's bloody ambush of a Fullerton undercover police officer underscores the increasing potential for violence facing drug investigators and the wide-ranging, sometimes nomadic nature of narcotics dealers who cross city borders to do business. Officer Tommy De La Rosa, 43, was fatally wounded by drug dealers at a modest stucco home where he went to deliver what he promised would be a 200-kilogram shipment of cocaine. Before he died, De La Rosa shot and killed one suspect, and police later arrested 13 others with suspected ties to the drug ring. Investigators said Friday that the gunmen apparently wanted to steal the cocaine and did not know that De La Rosa was participating in a reverse sting operation during which the suspects were ostensibly to buy $4 million worth of cocaine. Authorities say De La Rosa's death illustrates the danger of undercover narcotics agents who regularly confront heavily armed drug dealers who think nothing of preying upon each other to steal narcotics or money. "The level of violence is on an upward spiral," said Special Agent Ralph Lockridge, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Los Angeles. "It's hard to recall a case when we dealt with drug traffickers who weren't armed. It's just part of the game now." National statistics indicate that DEA agents are involved in two gun battles a week on average. Lockridge said assaults, stabbings and beatings of federal narcotics officers occur almost daily across the country. In one of the worst incidents, two DEA agents were killed and a third wounded in February, 1988, during an undercover operation in a posh Pasadena neighborhood. The prospective drug sellers opened fire on the officers as they negotiated a $90,000 heroin deal. Return fire killed two suspects and four others were arrested. Authorities said the slain agents, George M. Montoya, 34, and Paul Seema, 52, and the wounded officer, Jose Martinez, 25, were victims of "an obvious murder-theft" setup to steal money for the drug-buy. In Orange County, 29 officers have died in the line of duty, but De La Rosa is the only one killed by gunfire during a drug operation, according to statistics compiled by the Sheriff's Department. Two other officers, Sheriff's Deputy Mark S. Tonkin, 31, and Anaheim Police Officer Gary A. Nelson, 35, were killed in helicopter accidents while participating in drug-related surveillances. Santa Ana police say that they have been shot at during several narcotics investigations and that at least two Santa Ana drug agents have been wounded by gunfire in slightly more than a decade. Narcotics investigators for the Sheriff's Department estimate that about 80% of the narcotics dealers they investigate are armed with knives, pistols, shotguns, semiautomatic or automatic weapons. On a few occasions, they say, they have seen booby traps. "It has been something that has been gaining momentum for several years," Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said. "People who would never have thought to arm themselves 15 years ago, such as marijuana dealers, are obtaining weapons." Although many drug dealers carry weapons, what has changed, authorities say, is their willingness to pull the trigger to protect their cash and drugs or to steal the same from other traffickers. Sometimes, drug agents like De La Rosa get caught in the middle. Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard, head of the city's narcotics bureau, said that during his long tenure as a drug investigator he has heard about numerous narcotics rip-offs from traffickers who claim to have been victimized. "You hear about this regularly. They have been ripping each other off for years," Lockridge said. "That's what makes it such a dirty, dangerous game. No one trusts anyone. And that's what makes it such a high-risk occupation for undercover agents." Lockridge warned that violence in the drug trade could increase as supplies of cocaine and other narcotics are curtailed in the nation's war on drugs. He quoted national drug policy director William J. Bennett as saying "the dogs will be fighting over fewer bones." "The risks are always there," said Fullerton Police Chief Philip Goehring. "How much will a man kill a man over? Four million dollars or $4? I have seen a man killed over a burrito. . . . At a small moment in time, Officer De La Rosa was on his own, and it was at that very moment when this (his death) transpired." De La Rosa, a father of four, was killed during a multiagency operation that had targeted an Orange County cocaine ring with activities extending into the Los Angeles area. Joining Fullerton police were Anaheim, Brea, Cypress, La Habra and Placentia officers. The task force is not unlike a growing number of cooperative arrangements set up by law enforcement agencies to combat increasingly sophisticated drug traffickers, whose operations transcend municipal, county and state boundaries. Over the last decade, police departments have created more units with regional responsibilities. The squads have been encouraged by the changing nature of the drug trade and federal asset-seizure laws passed in 1984, which allow law enforcement agencies to seize drugs, money and property from suspected narcotics dealers without having to convict them of crimes. In Orange County, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies banded together in the mid-1980s to form the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program under the command of a Sheriff's Department captain. The pool of narcotics investigators from at least 18 departments handles major investigations and asset-seizure cases throughout Orange County and Southern California. Statistics show that during its first four years of operation, RNSP officers have seized at least 9,500 pounds of cocaine, 2,228 pounds of marijuana and $45 million in assets from drug traffickers. The FBI has described the unit as one of the most effective of its kind in the nation. "Unless you are a large enough department, you cannot always handle major cases on your own," said Helton of the Santa Ana police. "Here in Orange County, if you have a large narcotics deal, it would not be uncommon to solicit the aid of other cities." On a smaller scale, but with the same approach in mind, individual law enforcement agencies have been pursuing narcotics suspects beyond their city borders with increasing regularity. Brea police were among the first in Southern California to recognize the need for cooperation and the potential of federal asset-seizure laws that allow local police to claim as much as 90% of the cash and assets confiscated in criminal investigations. In 1984, Brea formed a special enforcement division, and one of the officers began using a seized red Corvette to help him infiltrate drug rings throughout the region. Although Brea is in Orange County, the unit often worked with a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department drug squad based in Whittier. Brea officers helped on tedious stakeouts and followed suspects, whether they headed for the San Fernando Valley or Las Vegas. It has paid off. The department has received its share of more than $4 million from seized cash and assets. In still another example of cooperation, four small police departments in Maywood, Bell-Cudahy, South Gate and Huntington Park formed the Southeast Area Narcotics Enforcement Team two years ago. The cities had so few resources -- Maywood had only 25 sworn officers at the time -- that they could hardly make a dent in the local narcotics problem on their own. Although the 10 SEANET officers still arrest pushers at local parks and raid rock houses, they periodically have helped DEA agents investigate truckers suspected of transporting narcotics. * WHAT WENT WRONG Fullerton police explain how officer made a fatal mistake.

19900703000000000	ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 8 SUSPECTS ENTER NOT GUILTY PLEAS. Eight people accused of fatally shooting an undercover Fullerton police officer during a June 21 drug sting operation pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of murder. The suspects, seven men and a woman, entered the pleas during arraignment Monday afternoon in Downey Municipal Court. All eight were ordered back to Los Angeles County Jail, where they are being held without bail in connection with the June 21 killing of Officer Tommy De La Rosa. A preliminary hearing in the case was scheduled for Sept. 5 in Downey Municipal Court. De La Rosa, 43, was killed in an ambush as he attempted to sell $4 million worth of cocaine in a "reverse sting" operation. The eight suspects gave addresses in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Police said the eight, apparently not realizing De La Rosa was an undercover policeman, conspired to rob and kill the officer. Those charged are Omar Yuriar Noriega, 23; Raul Meza, 49; Jerome Leon Sanchez, 29; Jesus Rodriguez Pena, 22; Ydalvys Escobar, 38; Luis Plantillas Benetez, 37; Miguel Leon Escobar, 34, and Frederico Edward Marriott.
19890710000000000	SAN CLEMENTE DEDICATES NEW PARK TO SLAIN PATROLMAN. Dispatcher Pat Petri had just asked a young patrolman to investigate a medical emergency when she got the call that still haunts her -- and San Clemente's police force -- nearly 11 years later: "Officer down." Richard T. Steed, 30, an amiable young officer who had been on the job for nearly three years, had responded to the report that a man was injured. And in an alley near the downtown business district, he got out of his car and was shot, twice. An hour later, at San Clemente General Hospital, he was pronounced dead, becoming the first -- and still only -- San Clemente police officer to die in the line of duty. Petri, now a community services officer, remembered Steed on Sunday as she, his fellow officers, members of his family and some 100 spectators joined San Clemente officials in dedicating a new city park in his name. Carved out of the brown hills east of downtown San Clemente, the 40-acre facility is to be called the Richard T. Steed Memorial Park and World Class Softball Complex. So far it has four grassy ball diamonds, but more play areas are planned, according to South Coast Sports Enterprise, which developed the park jointly with the city. At the entrance to the complex is a bronze plaque explaining that Steed was killed while on duty on Nov. 29, 1978. "Blessed are the peacemakers," it says. Police arrested a suspect in Steed's death, 23-year-old transient James Richard Hoffer, who was suffering an apparently self-inflicted stab wound. Hoffer was charged with murder, but in 1981 he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to Atascadero State Hospital. Sunday's ceremonies were marked by a rifle salute and dozens of red, white and blue balloons, as well as speeches that mixed joy over the opening of the park with brief, sometimes sorrow-tinged remembrances of Steed. "Even though Rick was the first peace officer to die in the history of San Clemente, let's pray he's the last," said the slain officer's father, Henry C. Steed, a retired engineer from Whispering Pines, Va. Still, the senior Steed was delighted over the testimonial to his son. "He would have loved this," Steed said. "He loved ball. He liked to play baseball" and even hurried through his wedding so he could get to a game. Kathleen Steed, the officer's widow, called the dedication "wonderful. He would have wanted to be the first one to hit a ball," she said. Later, she strode out to the pitcher's mound and formally opened the park with a ceremonial first pitch. Again and again, dedication speakers said they believe Steed would have wanted an upbeat affair -- not a solemn one. "We didn't want this to be a somber affair in terms of testimonials and tears that were many years ago," explained Gary E. Brown, who was police chief when Steed was killed and who is now deputy city manager of Visalia. But, he said, "by doing this you are showing that you do care, that you do remember." For police officers like the current chief of police, Albert C. Ehlow, Sunday's ceremonies were "a dream come true." Soon after Steed's death, officers started a campaign to name a park after him, Ehlow said. There were several proposals, including one attempt by the council to name a rose garden after Steed -- which police officers considered inappropriate. But until now, "it just didn't happen," Ehlow said. Like dispatcher Petri, Ehlow said he still recalls the night Steed was killed. Then working as station commander, he got a call at home that one of his officers had been hurt. Ehlow said he sped to the hospital, where "I found out it was Rick." One bullet had grazed Steed's arm, and the other had hit his upper left chest, apparently "through his (bulletproof) vest." Later, Ehlow said, a Los Angeles police officer who specialized in police shootings studied how the bullet could have bypassed Steed's vest. "He theorized that Rick saw the gun at the last moment. He drew." But as he did so, Steed apparently "dipped his shoulder" and leaned forward, and the bullet went inside the top of the vest, entering his left side, the police chief said. Ehlow called Steed a good officer who didn't have much of a chance again the man who shot him. His luck as a cop was up, Ehlow said. "It was his time." Lt. Bill Trudeau, who in 1978 was the first officer to respond to Steed's shooting, agreed. But he also said, "I use this (incident) to tell the guys about safety" -- that even when they're responding to a medical aid call, they should be cautious. Trudeau said he tells officers: "Remember, you walk out that back door, you might not come back."
19900710000000000	NATION; REPORTER TELLS SOURCE, IS FREED. A television reporter told a judge the name of a confidential source today and was immediately freed from the jail where he had served two weeks of a six-month contempt-of-court sentence. "I want to see my wife and my son and have a pizza and beer," said KMOL reporter Brian Karem, moments after he was freed by Texas District Judge Pat Priest. Karem was jailed June 27 for refusing to say who arranged a telephone interview with jailed capital murder suspect Henry Hernandez. Hernandez and his brother, Julian, are charged in the March, 1989, shooting death of a San Antonio police officer, Gary Williams. Karem today identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a cousin of the Hernandez brothers. He said he decided to reveal the name after Ledesma, who now lives in California, agreed to relieve him of his promise to protect her identity.
19890902000000000	METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERY DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF MURDER. Two armed-robbery defendants are responsible for the 1988 murder of an Inglewood police sergeant even though they are not charged with pulling the trigger, the prosecuting attorney argued in Torrance Superior Court on Friday. Joevone Elster, 23, and Van Otis Wilson, 22, both of Los Angeles, face 25 years to life for first-degree murder and robbery charges in the March 31, 1988, shooting death of Inglewood Police Sgt. George Aguilar. Police say the bullet that killed Aguilar -- the first Inglewood police officer to be murdered in the line of duty in the department's 81-year history -- was fired by Leslie Holget, also of Los Angeles. Police say Holget died after shooting himself at the end of a 45-mile chase that led police to Newhall. A 15-year veteran who worked as an undercover narcotics officer, Aguilar was shot while in a high-speed chase of suspects in the armed robbery of a Los Angeles gas station money courier. Four defendants -- including Elster and Wilson -- were charged with robbing Masih Modani, the courier, of about $2,000. Because Aguilar was killed while investigating the robbery, all four defendants faced murder charges. One of the defendants, a 15-year-old, has been found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to the California Youth Authority until he is 25. Patrick Anthony Carr has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and agreed to testify in the trial of Elster and Wilson. He is awaiting sentencing.
19890903000000000	BOTCHED HEIST LED TO DEATH, JURIES TOLD. What began as an "easy money" scheme by a disgruntled former gas station employee turned into a bungled armed robbery that left an Inglewood police officer dead, the prosecution said as a murder trial opened in Torrance Superior Court on Friday for two defendants. Joevone Elster, 24, and Van Otis Wilson, 22, both of Los Angeles, have pleaded not guilty to murder and robbery charges that could bring them 25 years to life in prison. Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Lenhart said the "evil plot" unfolded on March 31, 1988 when five friends took two cars to the gas station at Manchester Boulevard and Ash Avenue in Los Angeles. They waited there until about 10 a.m., when Masih Modani, a money courier, drove up to the station, collected the cash receipts and headed down Manchester into Inglewood. The five followed Modani, forced him to stop his car and robbed him at gunpoint, Lenhart said. Minutes after the holdup, Sgt. George Aguilar, an undercover narcotics investigator, drove by, picked up Modani and began pursuing the defendants. As he pulled up next to Modani's stolen car in an attempt to cut it off, shots rang out and Aguilar was killed. Police say the bullet that killed Aguilar, the first Inglewood police officer to be murdered in the line of duty in the department's 81-year history, was fired by Leslie Holget of Los Angeles. Police say Holget died that night after he led officers on a 45-mile chase that ended when he pulled to the side of the road in Newhall and shot himself. Although police say Elster and Wilson did not pull the trigger that killed Aguilar, they are charged with his murder because he died in the course of the robbery in which they were allegedly involved. The other two involved in the heist have already been convicted of murder. A 16-year-old juvenile was found guilty of robbery and first-degree murder last year and was sentenced to the California Youth Authority until he is 25. Patrick Anthony Carr, 21, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in June and agreed to testify in the trial of Elster and Wilson. He will be sentenced later this month. While forgoing opening statements, attorneys for the defendants offered sketchy details of their defense in interviews. "My man was not involved," said Robert A. Welbourn, the attorney for Elster. Welbourn said Elster was in a separate car and was not at the scene of the shooting. Bruce McCaslin, Wilson's attorney, said his client, although he was in the car with Holget, did not kill Aguilar. McCaslin suggested that the robbery had already ended when Aguilar was shot and only the deceased Holget can be held responsible for the officer's death.  Robbery Planned for Weeks "It's clear from the evidence that Holget fired the gun that killed Sgt. Aguilar," McCaslin said. In the prosecution's opening statement, Lenhart told two separate juries, one for each defendant, that Elster planned the robbery several weeks after he had been fired from a cashier's position there. Leonhardt gave this account: Elster recruited the others to rob the station. After staking it out for three days, the defendants on March 31 followed Modani's car down Manchester Boulevard in two vehicles. Holget and Wilson forced Modani out of his car at gunpoint at the intersection of Manchester and Eucalyptus Avenue. The men stole Modani's car and fled in the three vehicles with more than $2,000. Soon after the robbery, Modani spotted Aguilar, whom he knew as an occasional customer at the station, and flagged him down. Aguilar, a 15-year veteran, radioed for help and pursued the robbers with Modani in the passenger seat of his unmarked police car. As the cars sped south on La Brea Avenue, Aguilar tried to pull alongside Modani's stolen vehicle at Arbor Vitae Street and was hit in the chest by gunfire that passed through the car's door. Wilson was found by police soon afterward, hiding in the stairway of a nearby apartment complex with the stolen money. Elster was arrested after he contacted KTLA reporter Warren Wilson and arranged to give himself up to officials of the Los Angeles district attorney's office. The prosecution's first witness Friday was Aguilar's widow, Rebecca, who testified that her husband left the house early that morning to attend a police training seminar after saying goodby to her and the couple's young son, Christopher.  ' . . . He Was Dead' When asked when she saw her husband next, Rebecca Aguilar began crying. "I saw him in the hospital, and he was dead," she said. On a request from the defense, Judge John P. Shook asked Rebecca Aguilar to remain on call as a witness and therefore not observe the proceedings, a move that Leonhardt later called "a ruse to keep her out of the presence of the jury." The judge also granted a pretrial motion by the prosecution to exclude any mention of the cause of Holget's death. The dual juries, a technique used occasionally with multiple defendants, were impaneled at the request of the prosecution in order to combine two trials while ensuring that evidence relevant to one defendant does not prejudice the other defendant's case. Lawyers said the defendants may testify against each other, and in such an instance one jury would be removed from the courtroom. In addition, Elster will be tried simultaneously for an unrelated attempted robbery that occurred at a private home on Edgehill Drive in Los Angeles 10 days before the gas station robbery. Evidence relating to the attempted robbery will not be heard by the jury for Wilson. Lawyers said the trial, which will resume Wednesday, could continue for several weeks.
19890904000000000	THE NATION. The number of police officers killed on drug-related duty reached an all-time high in 1988, the Washington-based Crime Control Institute said. The group's study found that 14 officers died in drug raids and arrests and in serving warrants, including one who was assassinated in New York. It said such killings have averaged seven a year since 1972, when the FBI began analyzing on-duty police deaths, and the proportion attributable to drug-related crime was 18% in 1988, up from 6% in 1985. Lawrence W. Sherman, the University of Maryland professor who heads the institute, said that stepped-up anti-drug efforts influenced the figures.
19900920000000000	SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO. Jury selection in the murder case of Stacy Butler, accused of killing a San Diego police officer, will begin Oct. 19, a judge ruled Wednesday. Butler, 27, of San Diego, is charged in the slaying of Officer Jerry Hartless, 24, who was shot in the forehead in Southeast San Diego on Jan. 9, 1988. He died three weeks later. Superior Court Judge William Kennedy set the trial date for Oct. 19. One of Butler's attorneys, William Nimmo, said jury selection may last two months. The district attorney's office has filed special circumstances allegations against Butler, and he could receive the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. The special circumstances allege that Hartless was killed while in the performance of his police duties.
19900920000000000	BULLETS FIRED AT BROTHER OF OFFICER KILLED IN SHOOTING; CRIME: THE GUNFIRE ERUPTED SHORTLY BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE ACCUSED SLAYER'S TRIAL. NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THE INCIDENT.. Just hours before trial began for the accused killer of Los Angeles Police Officer Daniel Pratt, the slain officer's brother, who is also an LAPD officer, was shot at on the Long Beach Freeway while on his way home early Wednesday, authorities said. Investigators discounted the possibility that the freeway shooting was connected to the brother's death, however. "They're in no way connected," said Lt. Ken Lady, an LAPD investigator. "I think it was just a random shooting and they (the attackers) didn't know he was a policeman." Officer Brian Pratt, 27, was not injured in the 3:15 a.m. incident in the City of Commerce during which he exchanged several shots with passengers in a 1975 Ford LTD that menacingly followed him for several miles on the freeway, Lady said. It was while being questioned about the freeway shooting that Brian Pratt remembered that a trial was scheduled to begin later that morning in Los Angeles Superior Court for Kirkton Phenor Moore, 29, who is accused of killing Officer Daniel Pratt, 30, in the wake of a gang drive-by shooting two years ago in the Hyde Park section of Southwest Los Angeles. "Suddenly, it just dawned on him," Lady said. One co-worker at the LAPD's Southeast Division, where Brian Pratt is a uniformed patrol officer, agreed that the two incidents were not related, but he added: "It does make you stop and think, doesn't it?" Brian Pratt, who joined the force after his brother's death, was unavailable for comment late Wednesday. Moore and girlfriend Raylene Brooks, 19, were arrested about two months after Daniel Pratt was killed. Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said the slain officer was the first Los Angeles policeman to die as a result of a gang-related drive-by shooting. The officer was working undercover on the night of Sept. 4, 1988, when he and his partner, Veronica DeLao, heard gunfire and chased a car they saw leaving the scene of a drive-by shooting. Investigators said the car turned and bore down on Pratt and DeLao in a service station at the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and Florence Avenue. During an exchange of gunfire, Pratt was shot in the face. DeLao was uninjured. Nearly two months after Daniel Pratt's death, Fox Television Network's "America's Most Wanted" did a segment on the shooting and the hunt for Moore and Brooks. Moore, who had fled to Las Vegas with Brooks, saw the segment and agreed to give himself up to KTLA newsman Warren Wilson. Wilson and a Channel 5 cameraman met the pair in Las Vegas and drove them to the station's Hollywood studios, where they surrendered to police. In the trial that began about six hours after the freeway incident, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Gravlin told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury that there was sufficient evidence to link Moore to the killing of Pratt, a six-year LAPD veteran. He said in opening statements that Moore's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon and that DeLao identified Moore as the man who killed the officer. Moore, who has maintained his innocence, sat quietly throughout the trial's opening statements and initial witnesses. Bernard Rosen, one of Moore's defense attorneys, declined to discuss outside court why he believes that his client is innocent. "It's going to come out piece by piece," he said. Gravlin said he would seek the death penalty if Moore is convicted of first-degree murder.
19891004000000000	JUSTICES URGED TO STAY DEATH SENTENCE. An openly skeptical state Supreme Court was urged Tuesday to overturn the conviction and death sentence of a man who, under the influence of drugs, killed a West Covina policeman with the officer's own shotgun in 1983. An attorney for Michael Anthony Jackson, now 34, told the court that the jury should have been instructed to consider the possibility that Jackson acted in self-defense -- although witnesses said the victim, Officer Kenneth Scott Wrede, had not even drawn his service revolver until after Jackson had wrenched a shotgun from Wrede's patrol car. Several justices reacted with unusually open disdain for that claim, as well as other contentions made by lawyer Gerald H. Gottlieb during arguments in the case in Los Angeles.  'Cost Him His Life' "Wait a minute," Justice Edward A. Panelli said at one point in the hearing. "If the officer had unholstered his revolver earlier, we probably wouldn't be here today. . . . He showed fantastic restraint -- and it cost him his life." The court also showed little patience with Gottlieb's surprising contention that Jackson's sentence should be overturned on grounds the framers of the federal Constitution had not intended to permit capital punishment. That theory has been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court for more than a century, most recently in a 1976 ruling upholding the death penalty. "I wouldn't waste time on that issue, counsel," advised Justice David N. Eagleson. Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas added a wry reminder that the state court is legally bound by federal high court rulings on federal constitutional questions. "You are asking us to reverse U.S. Supreme Court cases, are you not?" Lucas asked. "Isn't that a little heroic?" State Deputy Atty. Gen. David F. Glassman argued that there were no significant procedural errors in Jackson's trial and that his conviction and death sentence should be upheld. Officer Wrede had displayed uncommon patience in dealing with the suspect in his drug-induced state, Glassman said, "but he was met with such violence that he lost his life." There was "no possible analysis" of the evidence that would support a claim that Jackson was reasonably, or even unreasonably, acting in self-defense, the state prosecutor said. Wrede was on routine patrol by himself shortly after noon on Aug. 31, 1983, when he received a radio call to investigate a man acting strangely at a nearby intersection. The officer encountered Jackson, walking down a street barefoot and appearing disoriented. According to authorities, Jackson reacted violently when Wrede sought to question him, at one point grabbing an eight-foot garden stake and brandishing it at the 26-year-old officer.  Called for Help After a struggle, Wrede ran to the patrol car to call for assistance. Witnesses said Jackson also went to the car and took the officer's 12-gauge shotgun from its holder. Wrede then unholstered his service revolver and crouched on the other side of the car. Jackson momentarily rested the shotgun on the roof, but then fired the weapon, striking Wrede in the head. Moments later, more police arrived but were cursed and threatened with the gun by Jackson before he finally was brought to the ground by a police dog, authorities said. Jackson was charged with first-degree murder and prosecutors sought the death penalty, as permitted by law in the killing of a police officer performing his duty.  Admitted PCP Use At trial, Jackson, previously convicted of burglary and drug-related offenses, testified that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug PCP on the morning of the incident and could not remember shooting Wrede or the events leading up to the incident. His trial counsel argued that Jackson, in his state of intoxication, was not aware of his actions. Because he thus could not have intended the officer's death, he should be convicted of no more than involuntary manslaughter, the lawyer contended. Nonetheless, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury found Jackson guilty of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death.  'No Intent to Kill' Gottlieb, appointed by the high court in 1984 to represent Jackson on appeal, argued Tuesday that Jackson had fired into the flashing light bar of the patrol car and that the fatal wound to Wrede came from a ricocheting pellet. This was an indication, the lawyer said, that "there was no intent to kill -- no intent to hurt." There was a "high probability" that the officer's death was accidental, Gottlieb said. Jackson, he said, could well have been responding to a perceived threat to his own life, and he should not have been convicted of murder. "The pattern here is not one of action (by Jackson) but one of response," the attorney said.
19901011000000000	VIOLENT DEATH IS RARE FATE FOR DETECTIVES ON HOMICIDE BEAT. Homicide detectives weren't supposed to die this way, the investigators who knew Russell Kuster were saying Wednesday. Street cops, sometimes. Not homicide investigators. "We're not exposed to the same degree of danger that patrol officers deal with," said Detective Rick Swanston. He spent eight years working Hollywood homicide under Kuster, slain Tuesday night in a gun battle in a Hollywood restaurant. "We usually know what we're dealing with. Folks who get hurt on the job, they usually don't know the seriousness of the situation they're getting into." Homicide detectives are supposed to come in when the gunfire is over, put together the evidence and nail the bad guy. Then, after a long career of strange, frustrating hours, of cases closed and murders unsolved, they are supposed to collect a pension. "Everybody wants to do their time and retire," said Detective Leroy Orozco, a 28-year veteran of the force, 24 years in homicide. Kuster had been a friend for more than 20 years. "Then you can all get together, a bunch of old (guys) talking about the old days." Detective jobs are coveted in police work, and none is more coveted than a job in homicide. Kuster's generation has witnessed technical advances such as computerized records and DNA fingerprinting, but detectives have also seen the growing menace of drugs, gangs and high-powered weaponry. In the end, Kuster wound up a victim of the sort of seemingly random violence that plagues Los Angeles. He is now part of the 1990 body count that is on a pace to exceed the city's record for homicides -- 1,028 in 1980. As of Sept. 30, 762 slayings had been recorded within city limits. Like every other Los Angeles murder case, Kuster is now the subject of a three-ring binder notebook in which homicide detectives assemble interviews and evidence. Above Kuster's desk hangs a sign that says: Hollywood Homicide Our Day Begins When Yours Ends According to investigators, Kuster was in the cocktail lounge at a favorite hangout, the Hilltop Hungarian Restaurant in the Hollywood Hills, when the man with the 9-millimeter pistol equipped with laser sights came in, terrifying the patrons. So Kuster identified himself as a police officer and tried to calm the man. The gunman fired four rounds at Kuster. As Kuster went down, mortally wounded, he managed to fire seven rounds at his killer, striking him three times. The homicide detective thus solved his own murder. The assailant was identified as Bela Istvan Marko, 37, a native of Hungary who lived in Las Vegas. That, too, proved ironic. Hollywood detectives had arrested him in 1982 in the fatal shooting of his roommate. Kuster signed the paper work. Marko had claimed self-defense and the district attorney chose not to file charges. Police said there is no connection between Marko's earlier arrest and the shoot-out Tuesday night. Retired homicide detective Hank Petroski was one of the detectives who investigated the 1982 shooting. Petroski had partnered with Kuster both in patrol and in homicide, and worked under his command before retiring this year after 25 years with the LAPD. "You understand some guys are going to get off, the D.A. is not going to file on others. It's frustrating but you can't let it bother you so much you can't do your job," said Petroski. "If end result is the arrest, you're happy. It's not only satisfaction of work done, but relief for the surviving family members," Orozco said. "But then the torture really starts because of our court system. . . . That's the toughest part of the job, getting into the court system and dealing with the b.s." Kuster's slaying wouldn't get that far. Detectives wept at Hollywood Division on Tuesday night. One of Kuster's men broke down at a press conference Wednesday. At other divisions, detectives felt the loss as well. "We've got guys here with tears in their eyes," Lt. John Zorn of the robbery-homicide bureau at Parker Center said on Wednesday morning. "They've known him for a long time." Kuster had put in 24 years on the force, his last 12 as a supervising detective in Hollywood homicide. "He was the best supervisor I ever had," said Swanston, who now heads the homicide unit in the West Valley Division. "He was very fair. . . . He demanded a lot from you, but he had a tendency to get the best out of his men." Petroski, who now works as an insurance investigator, said Kuster had told him he was going to work one more year and retire.  OFFICERS KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY One of the Los Angeles Police Department's best-known and admired officers, veteran homicide detective Russell Kuster, was killed in an exchange of gunfire Tuesday night.

19901122000000000	SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO. Appearing in Municipal Court for a hearing to review the status of his probation, Sagon Penn was ordered to find another psychological counselor after it was revealed that he was "suspicious" of his current therapist. Penn was ordered to undergo counseling as part of his probation in a 1989 case in which he was convicted of vandalizing a motorcycle belonging to a friend of his ex-girlfriend. After reviewing a letter from Penn's psychologist, Municipal Judge William H. Woodward said Wednesday that there was a "doctor-patient problem." Saying another six months of counseling sessions would be "helpful," Woodward ordered Penn to return to court Dec. 20 to report on his choice of a new psychologist. Woodward said Penn could terminate his sessions with his current doctor because of "a certain degree of suspicion being maintained by Mr. Penn." Penn, 28, was acquitted in two trials of the 1985 shooting deaths of a police officer and a civilian ride-along. Penn, who has had a number of brushes with law officers since the highly publicized trials, is facing a Nov. 30 trial on a felony charge of altering court documents.
19901231000000000	OFFICERS VIEW GANG THREATS AS PART OF JOB; CRIME: POLICE IN VAN NUYS REACT WITH CONCERN AND COOL INDIFFERENCE AFTER RECEIVING WARNINGS OF DEADLY RETALIATION OVER A CRACKDOWN ON DRUGS.. While three alleged members of a Van Nuys gang remained in custody Sunday, arrested in a plot to kill police on New Year's Eve, officers at the community's police station said such threats are just part of what it means to wear a badge. "It's a concern, but it comes with the job," a front desk officer flatly said. "At least in this case we're getting warned." The warnings came in threatening phone calls and in flyers, posted near the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys station, which promised deadly retaliation against officers for cracking down on drug sales along the 14100 and 14600 blocks of Calvert Street, described by police as lucrative locations for dope-dealing gang members. According to detectives, one flyer read: "Police have been screwing with our drug sales. So we're going to screw with the police and kill two or three of them." Officers at the Van Nuys station reacted to the threat with a mixture of concern and cool indifference. "No one's losing sleep over it. Just something to consider, that's all," said Officer Randy Holcombe of the Van Nuys station. Besides, officers sometimes hear of death threats and plots on the street, he said. They see graffiti threatening police officers. "There's so much talk of that," he said. Still, authorities took the threats seriously enough to issue a special bulletin Dec. 9 calling for extra caution among officers patrolling the Van Nuys area. Police declined to name the gang but said it has operated in the area for decades. The bulletin advised officers to be cautious but did not call for changes in operations or tactics, police said. "They'd be winning if we changed the way we do things," Holcombe said. Officers already follow procedures designed for their safety, authorities said. The bulletin basically reminded officers to observe those procedures. One officer said the bulletin echoed warnings from his days at the police academy. "Keep your head on a swivel," he said, demonstrating by looking left and right. "Watch your back." Still, the threat has to be kept in perspective, said Sgt. G. Tam of Van Nuys. "There's always a concern, but it's not something we're dwelling on," he said. Supervisors will continue to brief officers on the threat during roll calls for a few days. After that, "it's business as usual," he said. Police said information concerning the threat led to the arrest of Cesar Reveles and Hector Aleman, both of Van Nuys, and Sergio Camarena of Sylmar. The men, all 18, were in custody at the Van Nuys jail Sunday. No other arrests have been made. Reveles and Camarena were being held without bail on suspicion of conspiring to kill a police officer. Aleman was held on $2,500 bail on suspicion of possessing a sawed-off rifle. Down a long, narrow hallway from the jail, the front desk officer stood a few feet away from a wall where six photographs of police officers are mounted in somber frames. A wooden plaque with the phrase "in the line of duty" hangs below the frames and name plates: Jack V. Evans, Sidney Z. Reigel, Randy Marshall, Paul L. Verna, Roger R. Warren Jr., Charles C. Caraccilo. According to police, 175 Los Angeles police officers have been killed in the line of duty since 1907. Of those, 88 were felled by suspects. The most recent death came in October when veteran homicide Detective Russell Kuster was gunned down by a man who rushed into a Hollywood Hills restaurant brandishing a 9-millimeter pistol. Kuster, hit four times, still managed to shoot and kill the man.
