19941123000000000_11	It is only with the growth in environmental awareness that the IPT along with other research centres around the world started applying it to hazardous waste.	onli grow th environment awar ipt along research centr around world start appli hazard wast
19941123000000000_12	With plasma the temperature is so high that everything including metals melts and becomes a liquid pool says Szente.	plasma temperatur high everi thing includ metal melt becom liquid pool say szent
19941123000000000_13	This pool solidifies as slabs of residues basically blocks of glass and iron that can be used in construction or disposed of in landfill.	thi pool solidifi slab residu basic block glass iron use construct dispos landfil
19941123000000000_14	Because the result is a molten state which later solidifies there is less risk of dioxins being dispersed than with ashes.	becaus result molten state later solidifi less risk dioxin dispers

19941123000000000_17	The IPT is applying plasma technology to another pilot project to deal with the galvanised waste produced by companies in the metal coating industry a spin off from Sao Paulo s booming car industry.	ipt appli plasma technolog anoth pilot project deal galvanis wast produc compani metal coat industri spin sao paulo boom car industri
19941123000000000_18	Companies used to discharge the liquid residues from galvanisation straight into the Tiete River one of the most polluted in the world.	compani use discharg liquid residu galvanis straight tiet river one pollut world
19941123000000000_19	But with the introduction of pollution controls to clean the river the companies are left with a mud the by product of galvanisation containing heavy metals such as iron silica calcium and zinc as well as cyanide.	introduct pollut control clean river compani left mud product galvanis contain heavi metal iron silica calcium zinc well cyanid
19941123000000000_20	IPT tests show that when plasma is applied to the mud it destroys the cyanide and the end result is non toxic slabs of metal 96 per cent iron says Szente.	ipt test show plasma appli mud destroy cyanid end result non toxic slab metal per cent iron say szent
19941123000000000_21	Marco Antonio Barbieri director of a chrome company and spokesman for around 100 small galvanisation companies involved in the project says plasma treatment is likely to cost Dollars 40 Dollars 70 a tonne compared with about Dollars 200 for landfill Dollars 400 Dollars 800 for cement kilns and Dollars 1 500 for use of private incinerators.	marco antonio barbieri director chrome compani spokesman around small galvanis compani involv project say plasma treatment like cost dollar dollar tonn compar dollar landfil dollar dollar cement kiln dollar use privat inciner
19941123000000000_22	Despite all its apparent advantages plasma s progress so far in waste disposal has been piecemeal.	despit appar advantag plasma progress far wast dispos ha piecem
19941123000000000_23	Szente says this is partly because it is still a relatively unknown technology and also because companies are unwilling to decommission expensive incinerators to spend more money building plasma units.	szent say thi partli becaus still rel unknown technolog also becaus compani unwil decommiss expens inciner spend money build plasma unit
