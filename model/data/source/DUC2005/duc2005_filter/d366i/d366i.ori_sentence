Commercial cyanide use dangers What commercial applications exist for cyanide What industries is it used in How is it used What are its potential dangers What real damage has commercially used cyanide caused.
Sometimes the best story is the one simply told.
an hourlong "National Geographic" special airing tonight at 8 on Channels 28 15 and 24 and at 9 on Channel 50.
"Baka" is a straightforward look at the lives of a small group of pygmies in southeastern Cameroon and in this case straightforward does not mean dull.
"Baka" is an understated captivating study of another culture.
Producer writer Phil Agland and associate producers Lisa Silcock and Michael Harrison all of whom lived with the Baka for two years have produced a rare poignant glimpse into the everyday life of a little known tribe.
Concentrating on the lives of one family Likano his wife Deni and their sons Yeye and Ali "Baka" fully engages the viewer while showing the story of this hunter gatherer society through the family s words and actions.
Following the family as they search for the peke fruit a staple of their diet prepare natural medicines and get ready for Deni s coming child "Baka s" recording of the similarities between modern culture and this "primitive" society are striking.
The family is only a peripheral part of one riveting sequence waiting on the ground while a determined villager climbs a 140 foot tall tree a perilous barefoot ascent that takes several hours to raid a bee s nest of its honey.
The climber stuns the bees with smoking leaves and a cyanide compound just one example among many of the wondrous pharmacopeia of the Baka.
"Baka" touches on the greatest problem facing the Baka the destruction of their homeland the rain forest with a nice subtlety that other documentary makers could do well to study.
The subtitles let the pygmies speak for themselves and the narration (by actor Denzel Washington) contains little strident preaching.
Through its unadorned scenes of parents rearing children friends talking and people working "Baka" skillfully drives home its point.
This endangered group of pygmies may seem exotic but their humanity is universal.
5 a fellow worker found Dennis Claypool and Mark DeMoss lying dead on their backs in a large tanker trailer they had been directed to clean at a trucking company 60 miles south of Chicago.
The two young men had died in the same way as about 3 000 other workers in the last decade.
by breathing unsafe air in enclosed work spaces.
In this case federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials have concluded that DeMoss 18 and Claypool 21 died because all the oxygen had been sucked out of the tanker during a chemical operation two days earlier.
Claypool s father Philip a Morris Ill.
carpenter and occupational safety experts said the deaths of his son and DeMoss are symbolic of a striking failure by regulators.
Every year about 300 workers die in such incidents nationwide and all of them die needlessly according to John Moran former director of safety research for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
Unlike many health and safety issues affecting the workplace there is little disagreement over the need for federal standards to regulate work in what are referred to as "confined spaces.
" Some employer groups as well as numerous unions have been among those urging the government to adopt such standards.
In fact OSHA itself first acknowledged in 1975 the need to set safety standards for workers entering and working in confined spaces.
That was 14 years ago but standards still have not been issued.
In the meantime according to Moran s figures more than 4 000 people have been asphyxiated poisoned or died in explosions in boilers sewers refinery tanks silos airplane wings and other confined spaces.
Many of those died trying to rescue their co workers.
said Margaret Seminario associate director of safety and health for the AFL CIO.
Outline Exists for 10 Years The formal outline of how federal OSHA could regulate "confined space" entries has existed since 1979 when NIOSH presented OSHA with a 68 page document describing the criteria for a standard.
Since then OSHA personnel have written several drafts but never took any action.
Only a few days before Claypool and DeMoss died OSHA finally finished its confined space proposal and sent it to the Office of Management and Budget.
The budget agency must approve the proposal before OSHA can formally present it for public hearings.
A knowledgeable source in federal OSHA said the standard differs "very little" from the last major draft completed in June 1985.
The source said that for the last three years Labor Department lawyers have been tinkering with the proposal and writing a lengthy preamble to the standard.
Tom Seymour OSHA s deputy for safety standards programs acknowledged that confined space deaths are a "serious problem" and that federal regulations are "long overdue.
" It should not have taken so long to get a standard written Seymour said in a telephone interview.
he said indicating that the agency considered other issues more pressing.
Administration Opposition But union representatives and other safety and health officials asserted that much of the delay was due to the stated philosophical opposition of the Reagan Administration to adopting more regulations.
said Frank Mirer the United Auto Workers health and safety director.
Confined space deaths are hardly a matter of concern only to union officials and safety engineers.
At least some elements of corporate America say they have urged OSHA to act.
said Jo Anne Linhardt a safety expert for Organization Resources Counselors Inc.
a Washington based consulting firm that gives professional assistance to numerous Fortune 500 companies.
She said her organization had sent suggestions to federal OSHA on what should be in a confined space standard as have several unions and professional safety groups including the Water Pollution Control Federation.
Characteristics Listed A "confined space" is described by occupational safety experts as a space with any of the following characteristics.
The two most commonly occurring hazards in confined spaces according to Moran are oxygen deficiency and potentially explosive conditions created by the presence of methane gas.
The deaths generally occur when a worker enters a confined space not knowing that there is a lack of oxygen or that the air is pervaded by toxic chemicals that can swiftly be fatal.
The recent Illinois case appears to be a classic example as was an incident in Burbank in 1981 when two city workers were overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas when they entered a manhole unaware of the hazard.
In the Illinois case there was insufficient oxygen in the tanker that Claypool and DeMoss entered because two days earlier a chemical company had used nitrogen to remove a shipment of dodane a liquid used in making detergent from the tanker according to state and federal officials.
Nitrogen an odorless colorless gas sucks oxygen out of the air.
There was no sign on the tanker warning that breathing could be difficult according to a wrongful death suit filed by Claypool s parents.
Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the confined space problem is that the vast majority of the calamities involve multiple fatalities.
Generally at least one would be rescuer perishes as well as the original victim according to government studies.
Five Men Die For example last June five young men died in a confined space incident at Bastian Plating a small company in Auburn Ind.
They were asphyxiated by hydrogen cyanide gas which was created when Jeff Link was cleaning a 5 foot deep tank.
Four of Link s colleagues died from the same fumes while trying to rescue him.
Fogle s mother Brenda a waitress is now campaigning to get a federal law passed in hope that such tragedies will not recur.
Ted Tomczak a federal OSHA official who has been working on the confined space issue for almost five years goes further.
He said that NIOSH s division of safety research did detailed investigation of 39 confined space incidents from 1984 to 1987.
The investigations took place in 17 states ranging from California to Vermont and covered a wide range of industries including tanker trucks aerospace and waste water treatment.
The research revealed that 31 of the companies at which incidents occurred had written confined space entry procedures but that none of the companies had used them.
Only 15 of the companies had trained their workers on confined space hazards.
None of the spaces were evaluated or tested (for oxygen or chemical content) before entry and none of the spaces were ventilated.
And reports of individual NIOSH investigations describe a series of grim incidents.
In their defense federal OSHA officials said that they have not been powerless to respond to these tragic incidents.
In numerous instances they have cited employers responsible for confined space deaths by using the "general duty clause " a catchall provision of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act designed to plug holes in instances where there has been a fatality or a serious life threatening hazard.
For example federal OSHA s Long Beach office cited Continental Truck Wash on South Central Avenue and fined the company after a worker was killed there in an explosion on Nov.
10 1987 while cleaning a truck tank that had recently contained aviation fuel.
Michael Wright health and safety director of the United Steelworkers of America one of the unions most actively advocating enactment of a confined space standard said that general duty clause citations were better than no action at all.
However he said that such citations are tougher to sustain if challenged in court than citations based on a specific standard such as one regulating the amount of airborne asbestos that can be present in a workplace.
Primarily Punitive More importantly Wright said general duty clause citations are primarily a punitive tool rather than a preventive tool.
He said that inspectors "rarely" are able to issue such citations on a routine inspection before an accident occurs.
OSHA s Tomczak said the process of drawing up the proposed confined space standard had been long and "very frustrating.
" He said he could not provide a copy of the proposed standard until it had been cleared by the Office of Management and Budget.
The reason for having a written permit he said is to make sure that the entry has been authorized and that all the proper procedures have been followed.
Tomczak said such a system was designed to ensure that Charles Conner director of safety for the Los Angeles County Sanitation District also said it would be useful to have a federal standard that provided clear criteria on how confined space entries should be handled.
Conner said the use of proper safety procedures and good training of employees could vastly cut down these deaths.
He said there were no confined space deaths among county sanitation district workers in the last decade even though waste water treatment work is quite hazardous.
Discussion Set Monday Officials of OSHA and the Office of Management and Budget will meet in Washington on Monday to have their first formal discussion of the proposal.
OSHA s Seymour said there already are indications that OMB will oppose a major component of OSHA s proposal the requirement of a written permit system creating the clear possibility of further delay.
Still he said he is hopeful that the proposal will be cleared by OMB "before summer" and that it can go into effect later in the year.
Meanwhile Claypool continues to grieve and has formed an organization called You re Not Forgotten designed to provide moral support to the family members of victims of industrial accidents.
said Claypool referring both to his family s mourning and OSHA s failure to act.
Claypool has been given moral support by Joseph Kinney president of the Chicago based National Safe Workplace Institute an organization Kinney formed in 1987 after his brother died in a scaffolding accident.
Kinney asserted that the long delay in enacting a confined space standard showed how the goal of improving workplace safety and health in this country had been perverted into an by some government officials who set certain litmus tests that had to be met for regulations to go into effect.
GOLD MINING CYANIDE BLAMED IN WILDLIFE DEATHS.
Declaring that thousands of birds and animals are being poisoned Rep.
Mel Levine (D Santa Monica) and the Wilderness Society called Monday for a federal investigation into gold mining operations in California and Nevada that use cyanide to extract the precious metal.
More than 6 400 migratory birds and other animals including deer coyotes kit foxes rabbits and chipmunks have been killed at the Nevada mines since 1984 according to figures compiled by Nevada officials and released at a press conference Monday at the Federal Building in Westwood.
Most of the mines are in arid areas and birds and animals searching for water are attracted to the cyanide laced holding ponds that are an integral part of the mining operations.
Patricia Schifferle the California Nevada director of the Wilderness Society said Monday.
She said the death rate in 1988 was twice 1987 s in Nevada.
There are no figures available for wildlife deaths at California mines.
At the same time Levine s office released a letter urging the House subcommittee on mining and natural resources to request an investigation by the General Accounting Office the investigatory arm of Congress.
But the mining industry issued a statement later in the day charging the Wilderness Society with issuing misleading information.
said Bill Tilden chairman of the mining industry s Desert Conservation Institute.
An "informal survey" of 10 of 93 mining operations turned up fewer than 200 dead birds last year Tilden said.
By the time Tilden issued his statement Bureau of Land Management offices had closed and his figures could not be verified.
The call by Levine for a General Accounting Office investigation came on the eve of a public hearing scheduled for tonight by the Bureau of Land Management on a controversial plan to open a mine 100 miles south of Las Vegas in the Castle Mountains of the eastern Mojave Desert where a new 1.
5 million acre Mojave National Park is proposed.
Known as "heap leach" mining the method has become popular in the last decade because it enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from low grade ore.
Heap leach mining involves saturating heaps of ore dug from nearby strip mines with a cyanide solution.
1 cyanide bonds to the bits of gold and is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is separated from the solution.
Companies can produce an ounce of gold for about 200 or less and sell it for about 400.
It costs about 300 an ounce from deep mining and standard milling methods.
Schifferle charged Monday that the Bureau of Land Management was "ready to approve" the mining operation proposed by Viceroy Resource Corp.
Schifferle said referring to circumstances leading up to the 11 million gallon crude oil spill March 24 from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska.
BLM spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield denied Monday that a decision has been made on the Castle Mountain proposal.
But she said the General Mining Law of 1872 requires the bureau to approve the Castle Mountain mine unless it would result in "undue or unnecessary" degradation of the habitat.
Ross Fitzpatrick president of Viceroy Resources Corp.
But he told The Times a year ago that steps would be taken to protect birds and wildlife from entering the ponds including floating covers on the surface and the use of air cannons and multicolored flags to scare birds away.
The Castle Mountain mine proposed by Viceroy would extract about 40 million worth of gold from 2.
8 million tons of crushed ore each year according to company President Ross Fitzpatrick.
The strip mine will be 600 feet deep and 2 200 feet across.
Schifferle warned that based on the known deaths of birds and wildlife and other cyanide heap leach gold mines the mine proposed in the eastern Mojave should be prohibited.
Schifferle said mine owners are exempt from state and federal hazardous waste cleanup and prevention laws.
She said the mining industry is not required to pay royalties to the federal government or the cost of cleaning up public lands and restoring them to their original condition.
She pointed out that such royalties and cleanup charges are routinely paid by the oil and gas industry.
BLM hearing tonight at the San Bernardino County Government Center as well as hearings Wednesday in Barstow and Thursday in Las Vegas are on a final environmental impact statement.
The public comment period closes May 15 and a decision on the proposal is expected in mid July Maxfield said.
Unfortunately the humor is lost both on the Bureau of Land Management as well as to our archaic and permissive General Mining Law of 1872.
The responses which predictably range from shock to incredulous disbelief tell us that Californians are not humored.
The BLM hearing which should have asked the question "whether " merely asked "how.
" But despite this breakdown of the representative process thanks to the efforts of Levine and the environmental consciousness basic to almost all Americans both the bureau and the Viceroy Resources Corp.

Barstow 5 000 IN FILLMORE FLEE TOXIC THREAT FROM FIRE.
The threat of toxic fumes from a fire at a garden store forced 5 000 residents of this Ventura County farming community from their homes overnight but they returned early Friday morning after the blaze had nearly burned itself out.
Authorities are investigating the possibility of arson in the fire which leveled Dewey s Garden Center and caused 250 000 damage as nearly half of the city s 11 000 residents were evacuated.
A few spots still smoldered in the blackened rubble Friday as firefighters stood back waiting for the fire which was fueled by pesticides herbicides and swimming pool supplies to extinguish itself.
They feared exposure to rodent poison containing arsenic and cyanide which is easily absorbed through the skin and swimming pool supplies containing chlorine whose fumes can cause lung damage said Pat Askren chief of Fillmore s volunteer fire department.
he said The only reports of injury among the 125 fire and law enforcement officers at the scene came from two Police Explorer Scouts who were treated at a local hospital and released after complaining about tingling sensations in their throats.
Specialists from Ventura County s Environmental Health Department had advised firefighters against directing water at the flames fearing the runoff would be toxic said Dana Determan a department spokesman.
However air and water samples taken at the fire which was reported at 11 p.
Thursday showed no signs of toxics Determan said.
The fire which was also stoked by fertilizers and older wooden sections of the structure was believed to have burned at such a high temperature that it incinerated toxic substances before they could vaporize said Steve Kephart a county environmental health specialist.
The fire was confined to the shed like structure parts of which dated back 100 years.
Residents of the city s Eastside were directed to a Red Cross shelter in nearby Fillmore High School but were moved to three churches farther from the fire as winds swirled the smoke throughout the city.
The owner of the garden store Gayron Downs of Piru doubted he could rebuild it.
An arson investigator was pessimistic about determining the cause of the fire which officials described as suspicious in origin because it had been allowed to burn itself out.
said Peter Cronk an investigations specialist with the Ventura County Fire Department.
MINING FIRM STRIKES A VEIN OF CONCERN IN HISTORIC GOLD TOWN.
From 1881 diary of little girl moving with her parents to the Howling winds bellowed down the mountain into town flapping shingles on weathered homes and stores tugging at walls and windows with fierce force hurling dust through empty streets.
Nobody but a park ranger is ever home in Bodie abandoned since the 1930s.
Above the town on Bodie Bluff the wind had a different sound a gusty sonorous whine mixed with the unceasing hum of three drilling rigs.
It is the discordant noise from the drilling rigs and the sight of mining equipment and trucks on the hill hovering over Old Bodie that has many people upset.
Ironically fears are being voiced that this remote Mono County ghost town may be damaged or devastated by the very thing that created it gold mining and by the very family that fought to save it for posterity.
Busy Day and Night Since last September crews operating exploratory drilling rigs a few hundred feet above town have been busy day and night taking deep core samples.
Galactic Resources a Canadian mining company headquartered in Vancouver is tracking veins of gold missed in the past trying to determine whether the deposit is rich enough to mine.
lamented Donna Pozzi 37 chairwoman of Save Bodie a 6 month old committee formed by the California State Park Rangers Assn.
The mining firm is doing its exploratory work immediately adjacent to the park on 550 acres of private land.
A riotous gold camp Bodie is best remembered for its reputation as the during its heyday in the 1870s to 1890s.
The town boasted a population of more than 10 000 the biggest place between Sacramento and Salt Lake City.
It was the home of gunslingers like Three Finger Jack and Johnny Behind the Rocks.
Killings robberies stage holdups and street fights were part of daily life.
The red light district along Virgin Alley and Maiden Lane and a huge Chinatown were part of the local scene.
Only a Handful Remained More than 500 million (today s value) worth of gold and silver were gouged out of its diggings.
By World War I only a handful of people were left in the "top of the world" mining town so called because of its 8 300 foot elevation.
The Cain family s descendants were among the last to leave.
(Jim) Cain then 25 and his wife Lile moved to Bodie in 1879.
Jim Cain brought electricity to the town over the world s first long distance power line 13 miles from a hydroelectric plant.
He made a fortune building a huge cyanide plant one of the first of its kind and extracting gold from the Bodie tailings with it.
He wound up owning the town and the 550 acres of Bodie s diggings when mining ceased and everyone left.
To his dying day Jim Cain told his children and grandchildren never to sell Bodie Bluff and 9 000 foot high Standard Hill overlooking the town because This admonition and a love for Bodie became the Cain family legacy.
You can hear it in the reflections of Jim Cain s 71 year old grandson Walter as he talks about the old one room Bodie school.
he said going on to describe the last days of Bodie.
All through the 1920s 30s and early 40s ghost towns like Bodie stood vacant abandoned and ignored all over the West.
But that quickly changed after World War II when scavengers discovered that there was money to be made on Old West relics.
They descended on the old mining camps and carted away everything of value ripping entire buildings out for timber.
Finally in 1962 the state paid the Cains 65 000 one fifth of the appraised value at the time for the town the huge mill where ore was crushed mining equipment all the buildings and everything in the buildings.
the family owned firm held fast to its founder s admonition never to sell the 550 acres on Bodie Bluff and Standard Hill convinced that an underground bonanza was there to be tapped.
Several years ago the Cains leased the 550 acres to Homestake Gold Mining Co.
In 1987 Galactic Resources paid Homestake 31 million for the lease and announced plans to rework the old Bodie diggings if enough gold was found in exploratory tests to make it worthwhile.
The Cains of course were guaranteed a share in the riches from any strike.
Widespread Concern This quest for gold has caused great concern to members of the California State Park Rangers Assn.
and hundreds of people who have a special attachment to the unique ghost town tucked away in its hard to get to corner of sparsely populated Mono County.
Walter Cain insisted that the family has been completely up front about its mining plans.
Cain said his family could have torn down Bodie or let others walk away with it but had too much affection for the old town and realized its historical value.
Mark Whitehead 42 chief geologist for Bodie Consolidated Mining Co.
a subsidiary of Galactic has been appearing before groups in Mono County for several months to express the firm s concerns about Bodie and to offer reassurances that the mining will not harm the old town the local watershed or wildlife in the area.
If we decide it is economically feasible to start mining and we will know by the end of the year under California s strict environmental laws we must submit a plan of operation in great detail with Mono County and the Bureau of Land Management "he said.
"There will be public hearings on the matter and we will be seeking the advice of the public and the park before we proceed.
There are a dozen historic structures on the Cain property including the remarkably preserved two story Bodie Railroad Depot that we will be glad to present to the park.
We would hope visitors to Bodie would also visit our mining operations.
We could set up a visitor center in the mining area We realize the public s concerns because of the special nature of Bodie but we want to reassure everyone that our mining activity will be invisible to Bodie.
"If we decide to open pit mine the hole will not be seen from Bodie.
You won t be able to hear smell or see any of our mining activities from the town.
It will mean a big payroll to Mono County provide a stable tax base be a major economic boost to the area Any time we encounter a pile of tin cans broken dishes or an accumulation of square nails we know a tent or cabin was located there.
We flag the site don t disturb it and drill at least 100 feet from it Nothing here has been restored or faked.
Everything is as it was when people walked away from Bodie Noisy modern industry destroys the Bodie experience.
For years we have fought hard to preserve the kind of haunting feeling experienced at Bodie this unique look into the past There is absolutely no place like Bodie on the face of the Earth.
said Bob Macomber 43 superintendent of the Sierra District of the parks department.
Save Bodie Campaign In the forefront of the fight is the Save Bodie group which launched a campaign that has prompted organizations throughout the United States to write the Mono County Board of Supervisors urging that no mining permits be granted.
Mono County Supervisor Bill Reid a retired California Highway Patrol officer who owns a Bridgeport bar and restaurant said he is withholding judgment.
Reid said that he and others who are concerned about the issue are going on a tour of mining operations this month in California and Nevada to weigh environmental and social concerns.
"Let me assure you " he said As the dispute goes on visitors stroll the streets of this time warp in the mountains.
The shelves of the Boone Store are filled with dust covered products of the 1920s.
Across the street in an old hotel a 19th Century pool table sits in the lobby with an inch of dust waiting for players that never show.
Like the Leaning Tower of Pisa the Swazey Hotel looks like it will fall over any moment.
Coffins covered with dust and spider webs stand open and ready in the windows of the local undertaker.
Like a slice of history frozen in time the town awaits a verdict.
We applaud your article on the BLM (May 24) which provides an informative if rare peek at what is often called the "forgotten legacy" in the public lands system.
The message should be clear to anyone reading about the haphazardness of BLM s management especially here in California.
the agency s policy making apparatus is badly adrift.
Ultimately under federal law Congress must decide how to protect the California desert.
Today the new regime has failed to offer any substantive much less minor changes in the agency s land management programs or policies.
As a result many illogical discredited and potentially ruinous practices continue unabated.
Current policies as contained in the California BLM Desert Plan would also sanction large scale cyanide gold strip mining.
Such practices will dry up surrounding wells and streams and destroy wildlife habitat.
There is a well documented pattern of mismanagement by BLM in the California desert.
There is a significant leadership vacuum at the highest levels of the Department of Interior and BLM.
Congress must act quickly to protect the desert.
The California Desert Protection Act introduced by Sen.
Mel Levine (D Santa Monica) would ensure that 3 million acres of the desert will be preserved as national parklands.
The National Park Service with its respected record on preservation can be entrusted to enhance the unique natural qualities found throughout areas such as Death Valley East Mojave and Joshua Tree.
This transfer of land from BLM to the Park Service does not threaten to gut BLM s management role in the California desert.
Miners off road vehicles and other interests would also have approximately 4.
5 million acres to work with under BLM jurisdiction of course.

PLANT OPERATORS ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING CYANIDE WASTES.
Two brothers who operated a North Hollywood plating company were charged Friday with recklessly handling and storing thousands of gallons of cyanide waste and other hazardous materials according to the Los Angeles County district attorney s office.
Cyanide was also dumped into the Los Angeles sewer system at the All American Plating Corp.
in the 7100 block of Vineland Avenue while open and unlabeled tanks of acids were stored so close together that an accidental mixture could have formed a toxic cloud Deputy Dist.
Carter said Yoav (Joe) Pantilant 52 of Woodland Hills owner and president of All American Plating until it closed and was sold last month was arrested Friday morning while cleaning out his desk at the business.
His brother Sarv (Tom) Pantilant 45 a general manager of the firm was arrested at his Saugus home.
Carter said the brothers each face one felony count of reckless handling and storage of hazardous materials seven misdemeanor counts of illegal storage of hazardous materials and one misdemeanor count of illegally discharging into the sewer system.
The Pantilants were the first suspects to face felony charges under a new state law making it illegal to knowingly handle or store hazardous materials in a reckless manner Carter said.
The brothers could face up to three years in prison and 100 000 in fines if convicted of the felony.
The company which electroplated aircraft parts in a process that involved placing them in large cyanide and acid baths closed after the city of Los Angeles cut off its sewer hookup and the district attorney s office searched the business Carter said.
The investigation was initiated when employees told authorities about conditions at the plant.
The company had been convicted in 1987 of illegally dumping cyanide into a dumpster and placed on three years probation and fined 25 000 in a civil complaint case Carter said.
On April 27 investigators with a search warrant raided the plant Carter said.
He said investigators found a storage room in the plant containing as much as a two year buildup of various acid wastes.
On May 15 the city cut off sewer service and the county Department of Health Services began removing hazardous materials.
Though closed down the business apparently was sold to a Mexican company in June Carter said.
Attorneys for the Pantilants could not be reached for comment Friday.
TRAGIC LOSS OF 5 YOUNG MEN TURNED THEIR FAMILIES INTO JOB SAFETY ACTIVISTS.
When tragedy tore Linda Link s life apart she struggled with anguish then anger.
It is little solace for the loss of her son Jeff who died in an accident on the job but she is devoted to the cause.
Her son Bill died trying to save Jeff.
His son Larry was also killed in the rescue attempt.
And Sue Irish s son Barney died when he rushed to help the others.
Her son Craig the last man to come to the others aid also died.
After two days in a coma his respirator was turned off.
Five families buried sons their futures unfulfilled.
Now more than a year after the young men ages 19 to 29 succumbed to toxic fumes at Bastian Plating Co.
their parents are writing letters calling lawmakers rallying and pleading "Never again.
The campaigners were brought together by the June 28 1988 tragedy at Bastian where Jeff was overcome by hydrogen cyanide fumes while cleaning a holding tank.
Bill a plant worker for only four weeks and Larry climbed in to help investigators were told.
Barney once Bill s schoolmate valiantly tried to save them according to accounts.
Then Craig the last rescuer slid down the side of the tank and struck his head his mother said.
The workers did not know there was zinc cyanide residue in the tank said David Bear of the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Muriatic acid a dilute form of hydrochloric acid was the cleaning agent he said and the mixture produced the toxic gas.
Indiana OSHA fined Bastian 41 700 claiming that it had not provided adequate training respirators or rescue equipment such as a lifeline for pulling the workers out of the tank.
It also had not conducted air tests in the tank before anyone entered it.
Bastian has contested the "knowing" violations and paid the remainder of fines that total 1 700.
It has refused to comment since it released a statement shortly after the accident saying.
The parents say they knew their sons job could be hazardous.
Larry once told his ex wife his father said.
After the accident the families said Bastian made a terrible situation worse by not telling them how it had happened.
" A worker safety watchdog group asked DeKalb County Prosecutor Monte Brown to convene a grand jury probe of the accident but he refused to comment pending a report from the state Department of Environmental Management.
said Bill Groth a leader of the watchdog group.
With Groth s guidance the families began meeting with consumer groups talking with reporters and lobbying for stronger OSHA enforcement changes in worker compensation laws and measures to allow injured employees to sue employers who remove cautionary warnings or safety devices from machines.
They also consulted a lawyer Mike Kendall about legal action but with few exceptions workers compensation is the exclusive remedy for on the job accidents.
At the same time they have learned a hard lesson in civics discovering that government moves slowly and its agencies are hamstrung by rules laws and dollars.
Because Jeff was single Link said.
Together the families took flowers to the graves on the first anniversary of the accident.
Two brothers who operated a North Hollywood plating company that dumped thousands of gallons of cyanide laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer system pleaded guilty Thursday and must serve jail time for recklessly handling and storing hazardous materials.
Yoav (Joe) Pantilant 52 of Woodland Hills owner and president of All American Plating Corp.
was sentenced to nine months in jail fined 10 000 and ordered to clean up the site within six months by Municipal Judge David S.
Milton as part of an agreement under which he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges.
His brother Sarv (Tom) Pantilant 45 of Saugus who was general manager of the firm pleaded guilty to the same two charges and also under the plea agreement is scheduled to be sentenced Dec.
The brothers originally faced one felony count and seven misdemeanor counts in the case.
They were the first in the county to be prosecuted under a 10 month old state law that mandates jail time for improperly storing hazardous materials Carter said.
The new law also allows authorities to take action against a firm before a potentially hazardous chemical spill occurs he said.
A 150 MILLION A YEAR MARKET HAD GROWN FOR THE AMINO ACID.
NOW EXPERTS ARE DIVIDED ON WHETHER THE SUPPLEMENTS ARE HELPFUL OR HARMFUL.
Yet when it comes to amino acid nutritional supplements Americans seem to cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human body one can never have too much of it.
That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated 150 million a year market for the amino acid tryptophan in the United States over the last few years.
Sold over the counter merely as a "nutritional supplement " it nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people sometimes on the advice of physicians.
The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is behind 287 U.
If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of eosinophilia contamination is a key suspected cause.
However because tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body there is also the possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to harmful levels scientists say.
Tryptophan advocates who point to years of use of the amino acid say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak of the blood disorder.
Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame the situation highlights the rise in a quasi medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a "natural" way to remedy a host of ills.
Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a "natural" steroid dose in your body that will bulk up muscles the athletes grapevine says.
Or replenish your protein stores with leucine isoleucine valine and threonine the grapevine also says.
But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based is preliminary at best.
More importantly it was never followed up with the kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is enough and how much is too much.
Consequently critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing and therapy done in Southern California and elsewhere.
In some cases they suggest amino acid supplementation could be dangerous.
But psychiatrist Priscilla Slagle says she uses "a wide variety" of amino acids to treat her patients in Los Angeles Encino and Palm Springs.
Because she has concerns about quality control Slagle tells her patients to use only products formulated by Tyson Associates of Santa Monica which markets its amino acids only through doctors.
Don Tyson president of the firm said it does about 5 million a year in business through "a few hundred" doctors in the Los Angeles area and "a few thousand" throughout the United States and in Holland Italy and Belgium.
But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from manufacturers that sell through retail outlets.
These manufacturers count on popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele.
Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements the U.
Food and Drug Administration has no controls over their manufacture or sale.
Scientists and mainstream physicians have viewed the amino acid boom as relatively harmless since they assume Americans taking the supplements are adequately nourished.
But for a marginally nourished or malnourished person they suggest amino acid supplements might be harmful.
Animal research shows that when an animal is getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs giving it a high dose produces illness much more readily than in a well nourished animal said Dorothy Gietzen a biochemist who directs the UC Davis psychiatry research lab.
In addition some scientists worry about damage to the liver from having to break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of byproducts of the breakdown.
In the elegant chemical factory that is life there are four major components.
The genetic code provides a blueprint for all work the body does.
Twenty two different amino acids are known as building blocks in the protein division of this biochemical factory.
Just as a child snaps together Legos to build a thousand fantastic structures the body strings together amino acids in countless ways to make countless proteins.
(Amino acids come in L and D forms the L form being the version that the body naturally uses and the version most commonly sold.
) When a human lifts a finger has a thought or just breathes it is because enzymes and other proteins are causing chemical reactions to make this use of energy possible.
But the raw material for this comes only from taking in proteins in food breaking them down in the gastrointestinal tract and then absorbing the resulting amino acids into the bloodstream.
The body needs all 22 amino acids to work properly and a deficiency in any one of them becomes the limiting factor for protein synthesis.
However in adults only eight "essential" amino acids including tryptophan must be derived from food.
The other 14 important amino acids can be synthesized adequately by the body from the essential amino acids.
(Babies need histidine but develop the ability to synthesize it as they grow.
) Over short periods the body harmlessly makes up for shortages of essential amino acids by digesting protein rich muscle cells of its own gastrointestinal tract.
Over long periods or in a marginally nourished person deficiency results in disease such as pellagra caused by lack of vitamin B 6 which is produced when the body breaks down tryptophan.
Where advocates of amino acid supplements and their critics disagree is in whether it is useful or harmful to try to boost the protein building process by taking amino acid supplements.
Tyson of the Santa Monica amino acid firm says keeping track of his amino acid levels and augmenting them keeps him from getting sick.
Slagle and her patients say adding tryptophan to their daily health care rituals helps them sleep better and cures depression.
Tryptophan is thought to do this by boosting the brain s level of the chemical serotonin.
But the same effect can be gotten at less expense and with less risk of overloading the body by merely drinking a glass of milk at bedtime said Richard Wurtman a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher whose work showing the serotonin link helped popularize tryptophan.
Wurtman said he worries that the unregulated use of tryptophan means people are overloading their bodies with it and are doing so without knowing basic precautions.
It will amplify the effects of certain antidepressant hypertensive or antipsychotic drugs and should never be taken before driving or dangerous activities he noted.
Tryptophan s perceived status as a nutritional good guy provides an interesting contrast to the negative image of a sister amino acid the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate.
The "glutamate" part of MSG is an amino acid and like tryptophan is a neurotransmitter affecting the delicate cells of the brain and nervous system.
It is excesses of glutamate that are blamed for that lethargic headachy condition often called Chinese restaurant syndrome.
Yet the same people who worry that a Chinese restaurant is using MSG might go home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep.
Part of the difficulty in determining whether amino acid supplements are good or bad is that their various paths through the body and interactions with one another are complicated and so far not very well studied.
said Dwight Matthews associate professor at Cornell Medical College in New York City.
Matthews tacks radioactive atoms onto amino acids and then traces their biological paths.
At UC Davis biochemist Gietzen noted that studies of rats show that concentrations of amino acids in blood vary widely depending on whether the animal has been fasting or has just eaten the composition of the most recent meal and the time of day.
Citing a paper she uses as a reference Gietzen said there are wide variations in amino acid levels in plasma that are considered average.
For tryptophan the average range in men is from 30 to 90 nanograms per milliliter of plasma.
Before an individual s amino acid deficiencies could be reliably determined she said multiple blood samples would be required over the course of the day for several days.
Gietzen said Federal health officials who are investigating the outbreak of the blood disease eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much if they find evidence of large doses in people who acquired the disease.
However the fact that supplements have been widely used for years is seen as an indication that the problem may be due instead to contamination of the crystalline tryptophan powder imported from overseas.
Matthews of Cornell noted that for his studies he has to verify the purity of the amino acid powder before administering it to research subjects and he frequently finds contamination.
The Japanese have developed good methods for assuring purity of their product but a change in procedures could result in contamination of new batches he said.
In addition the high price of Japanese amino acids would put economic pressure on U.
companies to mix them with cheaper products produced with less quality control he said.
He noted that the complex chemical methods used for making tryptophan and other amino acids often involve toxic substances such as hydrogen cyanide.
Wurtman in his role as inadvertent father of the tryptophan craze wants the FDA to classify amino acids as drugs.

A state appellate court today overturned the murder convictions of three former executives in the work related death of an employee exposed to cyanide on the job.
The 1985 Cook County Circuit Court verdict against executives of Elk Grove Village based Film Recovery Systems Inc.
was believed to be the first in which corporate officials were convicted of murder charges in a job related death.
The appellate court ruled that the convictions on charges of murder involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct were "irreconcilable" because of the different mental states required for such findings said defense attorney Elliot Samuels.
Stefan Golab 61 a Polish immigrant who worked at the plant where cyanide was used to recover silver from used X ray film collapsed at work after complaining of dizziness and nausea in 1983.
His death was attributed to cyanide poisoning from inhaling fumes on the job.
CYANIDE ISSUE CLOUDS JUNEAU S VISIONS OF GOLD.
About 2 miles south of downtown on the western flank of snow capped Mt.
Roberts looms the hulking rusted frame of the abandoned A J Mine.
Its rich lode of gold gave birth 100 years ago to this small city in a setting of misty fiords icy peaks and almost constant rain.
Facing a decline in oil revenues city officials and Echo Bay Exploration Inc.
of Canada plan to turn the A J into the largest underground gold mine in the Western Hemisphere.
The mine would operate nonstop seven days a week and use tons of cyanide each day to leach the gold from crushed ore a technique that has transformed previously unprofitable mines into bonanzas.
It is also a technique that environmentalists say could pollute the region s air and drinking water and endanger salmon fisheries in nearby Gastineau Channel.
said George Rogers 73 a retired economist and Juneau resident of 50 years.
Echo Bay officials say the project would generate 450 jobs a 20 million annual payroll and 300 000 ounces of gold each year for the 13 year life of the mine.
5 royalties from the gold produced and gain an estimated 600 jobs indirectly related to the mining.
In full swing the project would amount to 7 of the local economy said Eric McDowell economic forecaster for Juneau.
That could come in handy for a capital city of 30 000 people that is filled with white collar government workers dependent on the state s dwindling oil income.
The plan developed by Echo Bay calls for milled ore to be soaked in vats containing a weak cyanide solution that dissolves gold.
After the gold is extracted residual cyanide would be chemically neutralized.
Up to 100 million tons of tailings containing toxic heavy metals would be dumped each year into nearby Sheep Creek Valley.
A 345 foot dam would be built at the head of the valley to create a reservoir so the wastes would be under 25 feet of water.
said Skip Gray 40 a cable television producer and leader of Alaskans for Juneau a group opposed to the mine.
Opponents say they will battle the proposal through several steps.
The company must obtain permits from a host of local state and federal agencies including Juneau s Planning and Zoning Commission but city officials appear committed to reopening the mine by 1991.
Mine supporters say it is not a question of losing a chunk of wilderness it is a question of saving their city.
said Don Abel 53 a lifelong resident of Juneau and owner of a building supply company.
Alaska s other two large cities Fairbanks and Anchorage have diversified economies based on mining defense transportation government and fishing as well as oil but they also suffered when oil prices fell about five years ago authorities said.
Meanwhile many of the old mines scattered among the granite peaks of the 100 mile long Juneau gold belt are being reevaluated for the first time in 45 years.
Last year Juneau saw one of the nation s largest silver mines swing into operation 15 miles away on Admiralty Island.
4 million ounces of silver and 36 000 ounces of gold has created 200 jobs for miners who are ferried to the site on catamarans operated by local entrepreneurs.
The sudden return of precious metals mining in these parts has caught wildlife biologists and state conservationists unprepared.
said a water quality expert with the State Department of Environmental Conservation in Juneau.
Indeed the Nevada Chapter of the Sierra Club last year requested a federal investigation into allegations that ponds containing cyanide at Echo Bay s McCoy Cove mine about 150 miles northeast of Reno Nev.
said Frank Bergstrom Echo Bay s Manager of Environmental Compliance.
Mindful of growing concerns about environmental hazards Echo Bay has moved aggressively to produce television advertisements and sponsor studies that could allay such fears.
For example Echo Bay hired aquatic biologist Jim Buell to conduct an 85 000 study to determine whether heavy metals in the concentrations expected from the A J Mine would affect the survival rate of salmon fry in a nearby hatchery.
Peering over a 5 000 gallon vat containing 80 000 inch long fish at the Douglas Island Pink and Chum hatchery Buell said.
Bergstrom said that so far fish exposed to the heavy metals seemed to be "perky little guys.
" A federal biologist familiar with the study however questioned the value of the experiment.
Contributing to the controversy are what some opponents call "possible conflicts of interest" that have arisen since the mining company came to town.
The City and Borough of Juneau and a local utility for example own the site of the mine and stand to earn substantial royalties from the gold it produces.
And Echo Bay is paying 100 000 annually to the only newspaper in town the Juneau Empire to rent the top floor of the paper s building as its local headquarters.
Jensen was 19 when he rode freight cars and ocean going barges to find a 7 a day job shoveling ore into subterranean box cars at the A J.
said Jensen who lives in a house he built and has decorated with bear and wolf trophies he has taken over the years.

OUT IN THE middle of nowhere due east of Brawley in the bosom of the Imperial Sand Dunes it is plain to see.
A two lane ribbon of asphalt known as California 78 slices through the towering dunes forming a line of unmistakable demarcation.
North of the roadway is seamless sand stretching in undulating dun colored swells.
Closed to vehicles the terrain is graced with clumps of green and gold dune grass creosote bush and an occasional silver leafed sunflower.
The only marks are the boot prints of desert wanderers and the faint tracks of a coyote or kangaroo rat.
A silence broken gently by the wind cloaks this empty place a stillness perfect for reflection.
Here all manner of vehicles are welcome and the land is mostly barren.
With the dunes fertile mantle of soil churned loose by the fat knobby tires of off road vehicles the only plant survivors are lonesome tufts of bursage and Mormon tea which cling to hummocks carved by spinning wheels.
There is not a pocket mouse in sight but human life abounds.
Helmeted riders astride two three and four wheeled machines zigzag across the dunes in a dizzying dance kicking up thick wakes of sand as they go.
The north side is protected as wilderness and treasured by hikers photographers and others eager to explore it on foot.
The south is a playground treasured by thousands of weekend dune jockeys seeking a tonic for the stresses of the urban world.
The contrast forms the grist for an unusually nasty and colorful war the struggle for control of the California desert.
With most of the West s mountains and coasts and river valleys claimed and carved up Southern Californians have come to covet the nearby desert s vast landscape of extremes.
Imported water and air conditioning have made the desert habitable in comfort even luxury.
Reliable vehicles have made its most forbidding corners safe to explore.
Since 1984 preservationists and off road vehicle users have faced off in Congress where U.
Mel Levine (D Santa Monica) have introduced and reintroduced the California Desert Protection Act.
The bill would answer environmentalists worries about threats to desert plants and wildlife by tightening restrictions on the use of about 12 million acres of public lands that are neither controlled by the U.
Off roaders however view the proposed restrictions as an infringement on their right to explore and enjoy this last Western frontier.
The outcome of past wilderness battles in Congress suggests a logical pattern for compromise.
This fight however is so entrenched and so infused with anger that no such resolution is on the horizon.
It is a struggle framed in terms that seem at times as stark as the landscape.
EVEN 15 YEARS ago few people went to the desert for recreation and when they did recalls Gerry Hillier district director for the U.
Bureau of Land Management The arid lands clearly have a new allure.
On Presidents Day weekend this year 14 000 people swarmed the Imperial Sand Dunes ignoring a cold February drizzle for the chance to as one exhilarated vacationer described it For these off roaders the spectacular mounds of sand that rise from the Yuha Desert in far southeast California are a beloved destination.
Reaching peaks of 300 feet the dunes are the largest such sand mass in the state stretching in a 5 mile wide band from the Chocolate Mountains for 40 miles south to the Mexican border.
The dunes southern portion is designated a "free play" zone by its caretaker the Bureau of Land Management making it open to anything and everything with wheels.
There is no speed limit and near collisions are common as riders often hidden from view by ridges in the ever changing dunes hurtle along.
Although state law requires that the machines be equipped with mufflers the piercing chain saw like whine of the engines is in some areas almost deafening.
Flanking the dunes are campgrounds packed with recreational vehicles.
Radios blare as those awaiting their turn on the all terrain cycles sprawl in lawn chairs nursing beers or sampling treats off the hibachi.
This is a family affair with some campsites encircled by fleets of cycles of all sizes.
Dave McWilliams introduced his son Mike to the sport at age 2.
McWilliams a truck driver from Hesperia for whom riding all terrain vehicles is "a great stress reliever " says his family spends "every weekend we can" at the dunes.
It is "healthy recreation " he says a wholesome activity for children and adults.
says Sam Bell of Long Beach who runs an industrial plating business.
"It s space " adds his wife Dana who says her life revolves to a great degree around cleaning up after the previous weekend s desert outing and organizing the next.
explains Dana a legislative officer for the American Motorcyclist Assn.
Although the most far reaching desert protection proposals would leave much of the Imperial Dunes and most other "free play" areas intact it s the off road vehicle owners who are leading the desert fight.
Their protests can be heard most clearly and perhaps understood best at Oldsmobile Hill.
Deep within the dunes about 2 miles from a paved road this formidable rise draws a crowd of 4 000 riders on busy days.
Revving the engines of their steel machines they circle at the dune s base ready to roar up the steep face.
The melange of vehicles ranges from the garden variety ATV to custom made dune buggies such as "Blue Thunder " a San Diego based favorite that is capable of zooming up the incline at 100 m.
says Henry Shorr business manager of a plumbers union in Alta Loma.
Riders such as Shorr have invested thousands of dollars in ATVs and view the desert as a refuge a place to fly across the sand unfettered by signs signals laws or other urban restrictions.
In this era of drugs gangs and other family stresses the riders plan to hold tight to this form of escape.
The Cranston Levine bill they say is a hostile threat.
Although the off roaders whose political muscle appears to have grown significantly in recent years are the most vocal participants in the desert fight myriad other less visible desert users view the measure as an invasion of their rights.
Among them are sheep and cattle ranchers miners and rock hounds who prowl for gems in the craggy crevices of the desert s mountain ranges.
Companies that string electric telephone and fiber optic lines across the desert are nervous as well and the burgeoning number of entrepreneurs tapping its bounty to produce wind solar and geothermal energy also are on alert.
The mining industry in particular has marshaled its forces and launched a spirited attack on the proposed legislation.
The California desert has been prospected for more than a century and today about 1.
2 billion worth of sand gravel and minerals mostly borates sodium and so called rare earth elements as well as gold are unearthed there annually the U.
The Cranston Levine bill would allow existing mining operations to continue and would respect valid mining claims that existed at the time the law took effect.
But further exploration of mineral resources within the new national parks and wilderness areas would be prohibited.
That angers industry geologists who dispute conservationists arguments that the desert s mineral reserves have been well documented and claimed through decades of prospecting.
says Charles Davis manager of government affairs for U.
Borax which runs an open pit borate mine in Boron near Edwards Air Force Base.
Only 20 of the desert Davis contends has been investigated for ore deposits.
Equally passionate are the sheep and cattle ranchers who turn their herds and flocks loose under permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management.
Grazing would continue in all bureau administered wilderness areas under the Desert Protection Act but ranchers with animals in proposed national parklands would be barred from returning after their permits expire.
says Marie Brashear of Fontana who is coordinating opposition to the Cranston Levine measure.
Largely silent in the debate is the desert s biggest single tenant.
2 million acres of desert lands from the China Lake Naval Weapons Center near Ridgecrest on the north to the Chocolate Mountain Gunnery Range in Imperial County.
The Army contending that it needs additional room for training sites wants still more seeking to add 240 000 acres to Ft.
Critics have challenged the expansion noting that the land targeted for acquisition includes important habitat for the imperiled desert tortoise.
But many desert users particularly off road vehicle riders insist that their access to the land should not be unduly restricted because of an endangered desert shrub or animal.
says Jeff Blosdale of Redondo Beach gesturing at the mosaic of ATV tracks marking the Imperial Dunes.
" TODAY S FIGHT is over land that nobody wanted for hundreds of years a vast seemingly sterile territory long associated with the vivid image of death.
Indeed at times the federal government literally could not give the desert away.
Millions of acres were free for the taking under a series of homestead laws starting in the 1860s but much of it went unclaimed appearing no doubt too forbidding for even the most enterprising settler.
Not surprisingly then the desert went unspoken for when the National Park Service and U.
Forest Service divvied up the most prized of America s natural areas Yellowstone Yosemite the Grand Canyon the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
In 1933 the Park Service adopted the desert s crown jewel creating the 2 million acre Death Valley National Monument and three years later the service protected 560 000 acres at Joshua Tree National Monument.
But large amounts of desert remained unclaimed with no a suitor to be found.
In 1946 Congress created one the Bureau of Land Management.
Awarded about 340 million acres of federal real estate that included most of the West s desert the BLM took as its mission a task quite unlike the preservationist oriented charter of the Park Service.
overseeing the "multiple use" of these forlorn leftover lands.
The BLM quickly became a solicitous landlord leasing millions of acres of range to ranchers miners and oil and gas exploration companies.
If the image of the national park ranger was one who wore a crisp green uniform and peaked campaign hat the BLM fellow was the guy in jeans a rumpled tan shirt and battered Stetson.
His job in the era between the end of World War II and 1976 was to simply cater to those who sought to use the desert for commercial gain.
Although advised to watch for flagrant abuses such as overgrazing the BLM was not charged with protecting the desert for the sake of the land itself.
To environmentalists this philosophy seemed like a crime and by the 1970s they had begun amassing evidence to support their suspicion.
Off road vehicles sales of which exploded in the 70s were running roughshod over the desert s fragile crust and marksmen were using tortoises and Joshua trees as targets.
Poachers were preying on the desert s bighorn sheep and vandals were plundering its prehistoric sites.
Scientists meanwhile continued to unlock new windows on the desert s natural splendor.
Through the years their work revealed the desert as a cradle for a startling variety of life 1 836 species of plants 420 birds 94 mammals 63 reptiles 43 fishes and 16 amphibians.
Researchers documented 46 distinct land communities from riparian marsh to desert forest with many of them literally islands in the sky worlds of animal and plant life that retreated to the mountaintops as the inland seas of the Ice Age shrank and evaporated.
In 1976 cries lamenting damage to the desert reached a peak and Congress sensitive to pressure from the politically potent environmental community passed the Federal Land Management Policy Act.
Suddenly the agency had dual often conflicting objectives.
Protect of the desert Congress ordered but allow users to have their fun as well.
To stay true to this ethic BLM officials were directed to draft a land use plan for the desert.
The subsequent effort was a landmark undertaking for the BLM which had never dealt with issues such as preservation or wilderness protection.
By 1980 the BLM plan the product of 100 community meetings 40 000 public comments and 8 million in taxpayer money was complete.
Although a flurry of lawsuits from some parties accompanied its birth the majority of desert lovers regarded it as a compromise land use plan that gave everyone wilderness supporters rock collectors off road cyclists miners ranchers and just plain people a share of what the desert had to offer.
For preservationists however the optimism that accompanied adoption of the document soon faded.
In January 1981 the Reagan Administration brought into office a dim view of strong federal land use planning and a crusade to cut the domestic budget in favor of military spending.
It could not have come at a worse time for the BLM s Hillier who oversees the desert district from a Spartan office in Riverside.
The BLM was forced to embark on its unprecedented management venture with only 20 rangers to patrol an area twice the size of Vermont.
Preservationists could see that the staff cuts were hurting the BLM but by 1984 they were convinced that a lack of commitment to truly enforce the desert plan was the agency s bigger problem.
The BLM they argued had not become the vigilant steward its leaders had promised that it would be.
Topping the environmentalists laundry list of complaints was the agency s 1982 approval of a series of amendments to the plan that reduced by 400 000 acres the amount of land the BLM proposed to designate as wilderness.
The amendments signaled Sierra Club leader Elden Hughes says.
The Barstow to Las Vegas motorcycle race a controversial annual event that had been canceled by the BLM in 1974 was inexplicably allowed to resume on a course that cut through desert tortoise habitat and a region being studied as possible wilderness.
And after failing to obtain a reclamation bond from operators of a mine in a wilderness study area in the Inyo Mountains the BLM was forced to pay 25 000 to remove 20 drums of cyanide left behind when the mine was abandoned.
By 1984 the preservationists were convinced the BLM lacked the will to enforce the desert plan.
Unless the desert was appointed a new more vigilant steward preservationists concluded the destructive forces bearing down upon it would leave only a tattered remnant for the ages.
ELDEN HUGHES traces his love for the desert to 1938.
He was a boy of 7 who caught his first glimpse of Death Valley during a family outing.
There was the towering Telescope Peak looming 11 049 feet above sea level and the fetid pond at Badwater the lowest point in the United States at 282 feet below sea level.
There were sand dunes seemingly endless salt pans and a quiet that seemed haunting to a child.
And there was the odd jagged ledge formed by an earthquake fault along the eastern edge of the valley floor.
Today this Whittier resident is one of the desert s most ardent defenders a self described "wanderer" who rarely lets a month pass without traveling there.
For Hughes the desert provides a place for contemplation and exhilaration for peace and inspiration.
He might stand on the curl of a dune waiting for the light to shine just right on a blooming beavertail cactus he hopes to photograph.
He might pack a lunch and prowl Caruthers and Keystone canyons in the New York Mountains where 273 species of plants create a stunning garden.
Or he might inch quietly across a sunbaked bajada hoping to fix his lens on an unsuspecting desert animal.
says Hughes a bear of a man with a silver beard.
For another preservationist Jim Dodson of Lancaster the desert s magic lies in the ability of its inhabitants to survive what seem intolerable conditions.
says Dodson budget officer for Edwards Air Force Base.
To Hughes and Dodson the desert is like a child precious irreplaceable and vulnerable.
And they are alarmed by what they see as random often senseless violence that is increasingly inflicted on its inhabitants and lands.
Thirty eight varieties of plant animal and insect life are threatened or endangered in the desert they say.
The most recent listing just last month was the lumbering desert tortoise California s official state reptile.
The tortoise seems to be dying out at a disturbing rate in part because of predation and loss of habitat but also because of disease.
Its demise many environmentalists say is an ominous symbol of the desert s plight.
With Southern California s population at 16 million and threatening to swell they recognize that human impact on the region s emptiest playground is inevitable.
The desert Hughes says Otherwise the elements of the desert that they cherish will be lost for good.
The best candidate for the role of rescuer conservationists believe is the National Park Service.
The BLM derisively referred to as the by some detractors has failed to give the desert the protection it deserves they say.
And so the Sierra Club Wilderness Society and other groups have concluded that the desert s best parts should become parkland.
In 1984 Cranston agreed and introduced the California Desert Protection Act.
Together with a companion House measure sponsored by Levine the proposal would set aside 4.
5 million acres of wilderness enlarge Death Valley and Joshua Tree national monuments and make them national parks and transform the East Mojave Scenic Area into a new 1.
Off roaders and other critics angrily contend that the legislation would fence off the desert for an elite few those fit enough to survey its wonders on foot.
"Locked out " they argue would be families with children or grandparents or disabled members unable to experience the desert s special places if denied the right to enter by vehicle.
But advocates describe the plan as a compromise that shields the desert s most spectacular and pristine features while leaving plenty of territory open to military maneuvers all types of motorized recreation mining and other uses.
Without it they say the desert s future looks bleak.
IN DEATH VALLEY Canyon near the foot of Telescope Peak lies a startling geologic formation one that blends billion year old Precambrian rock with limestone and lava from the Tertiary period of mere millions of years ago.
At a loss for any rational description scientists labeled this formation "Chaos.
" It could serve as a geologic metaphor for the continuing debate over the desert one in which the clash of extremes has created a seemingly immutable deadlock.
When the BLM s first desert use plan was submitted to departing Interior Secretary Cecil D.
Andrus in December 1980 the secretary asked what the people in California thought about it recalls Hillier one of its prime architects.
About 10 hated it as too restrictive 15 thought it was not tough enough and 75 generally supported it Andrus was told.
But alas for Hillier the vocal often shrill fringes of both sides still dog the BLM.
And the difficulties of establishing the agency as a resource protector on par with the Forest Service or Park Service have locked him too in the conflict.
Wilderness legislation in the West always is a contentious issue one usually reconciled only when both senators from the state involved compromise.
) has refused to work out an agreement with Cranston and is not likely to do so as long as Wilson is running for governor of California.
So the fight has moved to the Democrat controlled House where Levine has run into potent opposition led by Republican Rep.
Jerry Lewis of Highlands whose 35th Congressional District covers most of the San Bernardino County desert.
An influential GOP leader Lewis helped persuade the Reagan and Bush administrations to side with the BLM and oppose the Cranston Levine plan.
They support Lewis bill which essentially would ratify the present BLM desert plan into law.
A key to the BLM campaign to hold onto the land it now controls is the argument that the East Mojave does not have the unique and significant resources that would qualify it as a new national park.
In February at Lewis insistence the BLM persuaded Park Service Director James M.
Ridenour to sign a BLM composed letter declaring that the East Mojave area Park Service sources have disclosed.
At a jammed hearing in California Lewis brandished the letter for all to see.
The BLM maneuver horrified old Park Service pros who knew that sentiment within the agency actually ran with the Cranston Levine plan.
In fact the Park Service had concluded in a 1987 report that East Mojave And even the BLM s own desert planning staff found in 1979 that East Mojave But acknowledging that at this time one informed environmentalist believes would be a serious blow to the BLM.
If Congress grabbed the East Mojave and gave it to the Park Service he says that would undermine the BLM s fledgling perception of itself as a preservationist force.
Hillier insists that the BLM is making a sincere effort to provide the sort of long term protection the desert needs.
He bristles at the environmentalists notion that the BLM is partial to off roaders and miners.
Hillier says he is carrying out the congressional mandate which often angers the mechanized road runners as much as Sierra Clubbers.
And he resents the implication by some preservationists that his agency has stood by while the desert was harmed by special interest groups.
Although his budget and staffing have improved Hillier still faces an uphill battle to persuade Congress that the Cranston Levine bill is not necessary that the BLM can protect the desert well enough.
Although the Park Service has suffered devastating budget cuts the 33 reduction in real dollars since 1985 means that only 10 permanent rangers must patrol 2 million acres of Death Valley park status still carries prestige and tradition.
There is a perception among some legislators that critical areas of the desert would be less vulnerable to neglect and abuse if they were in a park.
Even if the dispute is not settled this year or next the desert will survive.
Critical portions are preserved in parklands now and others will become protected wilderness.
The BLM has proposed that Congress designate about 2 million acres in wilderness areas of 6 million originally studied for preservation giving them the protection the Sierra Club and others are demanding.
Whenever this battle is over it is almost certain that at least 2 million acres of desert will be incorporated into the national wilderness protection system.
Other portions have been designated as areas of critical environmental concern to protect special natural features or endangered plant or animal life.
5 million acre region west of the Colorado River and bracketed by Interstates 10 and 40 has been set aside as the East Mojave Scenic Area for management similar to that of a park but not as restrictive.
Such "interim" protection is vital because both sides declare that they are in the trenches until victory is theirs and there is no talk of compromise.
Hillier who has listened to such desert extremism for 14 years has come to hear in it commonalities unacknowledged by either camp.
Sounding a bit wistful and decidedly weary Hillier sighs and adds.
The owner of a Burbank plating company who had pleaded guilty to 11 counts of illegally storing and transporting cyanide contaminated sludge was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to pay more than 93 500 in fines a Los Angeles County investigator said Monday.
Larry Barker owner of Artcraft Plating and Finishing Co.
was also ordered to perform 200 hours of community service at his sentencing last week in Burbank Municipal Court said Marty Kasman a deputy health officer with the county Department of Health Services.
In exchange for his guilty pleas the city of Burbank dropped 27 other charges against him.
Investigators from the Department of Health Services had conducted surveillances of the plating firm dressed as undercover sanitation workers to collect the firm s garbage and put monitors in the sewers after company officials refused entry to inspectors last year Kasman said.
Cyanide was found in the sewer and in three trash bins when the firm was moving last year from the 100 block of Verdugo Avenue to a new location on East Santa Anita Avenue Kasman said.
Barker said in a telephone interview Monday that "we made some mistakes" during the move to the new plant but that the relocation has enabled the company to eliminate the use of cyanide and chrome in its plating work replacing it with a soaplike solution.
Artcraft primarily does plating for military and aerospace contractors Barker said.
A ROUTINE DAY FOR TWO CREWS IS ALSO FILLED WITH FALSE ALARMS AND LITTLE EMERGENCIES.
Up in the Antelope Valley the day dawns hot but humid the kind of summer day firefighters like.
Scott Graham is at the wheel of his white Jeep the one with the PARADOK license plates headed for Station 111 in Saugus.
Great loops of fire hose drying on the tower must be rolled and stored.
On another hot sticky day at Station 66 in South Central Los Angeles Rick Paiz and the other firefighters report for morning lineup.
Seated at long kitchen tables they hear Capt.
Steven Ventura s announcements about new coveralls about an upcoming swap meet and a retirement dinner.
Within minutes firefighters have pulled on their "turnouts" 75 pounds of fire resistant gear and are speeding to the scene a vacant house on South Harvard Boulevard.
Riding high on the rear of truck 66 is Paiz the tiller man.
In Southern California late summer and fall are fire season when parched brush land and careless campers or crazed arsonists can combine disastrously.
For firefighters the 2 700 men and women who wear the badge of the city and the 2 200 who are uniformed members of the county Fire Department brush fires are just another hazard of the job.
They are a fraternity men and women who share a unique life style a commitment that is extraordinary and traditions that die hard.
journeyman firefighters earn more than 40 000 captains 60 000 plus.
And firefighters can double their pay working overtime.
Rick Paiz 33 is a firefighter assigned to Station 66 on Slauson Avenue in the heart of Los Angeles.
Scott Graham 32 is a county firefighter paramedic based at Station 111 in rural Saugus.
Harry Thy who has 21 years with the department looks out the window to the dry hills of the Antelope Valley and muses about the chances of another blaze like the Bouquet Canyon fire that blackened 1 000 acres a week before.
So far this year the 111 crew a regular complement per shift of six firefighters an engine a paramedic squad car and a patrol car plus an engine and three men temporarily assigned while a new fire station is being built has responded to 1 700 calls only 20 of them fires.
And two dead children a toddler who ingested diaper rash medication and a little girl whose skull was crushed by a falling fireplace mantle.
says Dave Enriquez who at 25 is the "baby" of this crew.
It is 10 o clock and already Graham fields questions about lunch.
This younger generation of firefighters is more health conscious.
Besides he says a heavy meal is not always compatible with 911 calls.
En route to the supermarket a motorist flags him down to report a "really bad accident.
" He radios the station then speeds to the scene where a maroon Dodge Omni has jumped the divider and collided with a white Nissan Sentra.
" he asks the Omni s driver a stout woman in shorts.
In the Sentra s front seat the other driver a Latino man appears dazed.
Graham heads for the grocery where there s a special on mahi mahi filets.
Graham has seven years with the department 3 1 2 of them at Station 111 which handles 100 square miles.
Eventually he hopes to "promote " which means moving to another station gaining new experience.
Up here they talk about Los Angeles as "down below " where violence and drugs are rampant where the only doctor many people know is the Fire Department.
In the Antelope Valley people still look out for neighbors and know what their kids do.
But up here long open stretches of road and drinking drivers are a lethal combination.
Firefighters figure the odds of encountering a drinking driver on the highway.
This day Graham stops by the ICU at Henry Mayo Memorial Newhall Hospital to see a man he brought to the emergency room early the day before.
Cases like this would make anyone ask who chooses to be a firefighter.
Firefighters have seen it all yet it still gets to them.
Graham will never forget The man horribly burned kept screaming He died the next day.
And there was Graham s first time having to tell a family that their son had just been killed in his overturned pickup.
Graham tall and slender with tinted glasses styled gray hair and mustache is a PR man s dream firefighter.
He has been married for six years to Cindy his former dental hygienist.
Off duty he is a Pop Warner Football coach.
His idea of a vacation is fishing with other firefighter families.
He still shudders when remembering a high school job in a windowless room in a North Hollywood factory.
But Graham sooner or later will "go below" to Los Angeles to learn more about structural fires to promote to engineer and This life can be hours of monotony punctuated by moments of stress.
A firefighter s basic day at the office is 24 hours with catnaps in the dorm between alarms.
Firefighters sleep says John Harm who figures he has "homesteaded" at 111.
He came to the station in 1973 and plans to stay until he retires in seven years with 30 years.
Because firefighters may work 72 hours straight trading time with a buddy or volunteering for overtime (at time and a half) the station is a second home the crew a second family.
In their 11 day labor cycles they average 96 hours work.
For the men of 111 (there are no women there now) the heart of this second home is a multipurpose room with six slightly tattered brown tweed lounger chairs a giant screen TV the men bought themselves a long dining table and a homey kitchen with microwave and dishwasher.
The dealer calls the game which may be named for a fire captain shot by his wife or for a firefighter who lost his thumb when a fire hose got wrapped around it.
For firefighters black humor is a coping mechanism.
In the games bidding is brisk for the extra hand 25 cents 50 cents.
The basics condiments cable TV newspaper subscriptions are paid for with house dues 1.
This is an atypically quiet afternoon time for reading and playing cards.
But before dinner there s one false alarm vehicle accident.
one call to aid a 42 year old severe asthmatic in Saugus.
A boy 4 with a cigarette lighter had set his baby sister s playpen on fire.
The scream of sirens causes suburbanites to rush to their front doors to gawk.
" They are disappointed to learn that someone has fainted that there has been a fender bender.
Harm dashes to the 7 Eleven to get a list of winning Lotto numbers.
He recalls the prank now legend pulled on one firefighter a setup in which his friends recorded "winning" numbers on an answering machine at his station then bought him a ticket with the numbers.
Convinced he was an instant millionaire he told his captain what he could do with the job.
The men joke about staying up until 11 to please the "run gods " who may then grant them an uninterrupted night s sleep.
30 two hours after everyone turns in the dong ding for 111 sounds a fire on the logjammer ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain.
But the call is canceled before the rig leaves the station.
In a small apartment strewn with toys and dirty dishes a very pregnant woman is in distress chest pain.
She thought it was heartburn she had spaghetti for dinner but Maalox only made it worse.
At lineup the new captain tells firefighters that AZT may be made available to firefighter paramedics at high risk through accidental exposure to AIDS.
The disease "is a concern " as is hepatitis Graham says later.
He wears latex gloves and other protective gear but doesn t dwell on danger.
a woman 34 who thinks she may have had a stroke Graham takes her left hand and tells her Still he has detected a slight weakness in one leg.
Before brunch there will be two more rescues an assist on a 4 year old burn victim who will be airlifted from Castaic Lake by Fire Department helicopter.
Then it s the televised Dodgers Pirates game and funny car races until 3 p.
when the squad responds to a Magic Mountain call on a woman in line who has passed out because of the oppressive heat.
At day s end Graham shakes his head.
"In two years " he says He attributes it to his visitors ride alongs observing his shift.
"Down below " at Station 66 they re talking about a recent shoot out two men driving side by side down the street firing at each other.
They re talking too about the man who drove a car through the door of their garage on July 3 coming to a stop about an inch from a fire engine.
As he watched the passenger in a passing car spotted a fire station and grabbing the wheel from the wounded driver steered for the station.
The five square miles covered by Station 66 is rife with violence poverty and urban blight.
Firefighter Tom Scyphers who s spent seven years at this station says Rick Paiz is one of 12 firefighters working this 24 hour shift.
A firefighter for 11 years he has spent 10 years at Station 66 by choice.
he says but when there are fires This morning he won t have to wait long to earn it.
Soon after 10 he is on the roof of a house where a fire appears to have started in the attic.
He helps chop a hole for ventilation stripping dry shingles that are like kindling searching for hot spots beneath.
The house vacant for eight years was purchased recently and was in escrow.
The new owner summoned to the scene looks on in shock.
Her beautiful hardwood floors are flooded The flames doused the firefighters dripping with perspiration relax for a moment.
It was a typical house fire says Ventura By 11.
At noon Rick Ramirez today s firefighter cook is on the PA.
" There are cheeseburgers canned peaches in the can cottage cheese in the carton tortilla chips in the bag.
Lee Weber talks about drug labs in the area served by Station 66.
an ingredient for making PCP Weber says adding Lethal gases are only one concern.
Weber recalls a recent house fire when firefighters found a man inside still asleep.
Weber is a former construction worker who at 41 has 13 years in the department.
" But possibly the biggest hazard firefighters face is driving to the scene.
Weber who is married to a teacher says He adds Paiz was recently married to Laura who "works normal hours " he says.
He is happy at Station 66 but knows He hopes to make captain.
Above that he says Paiz figures he s in it for the duration 30 years.
When he describes big fires he has fought the first that comes to mind is a Ralphs market in the San Fernando Valley where the roof caved in.
He recalls it as Sometimes inside a fire Paiz says Being a firefighter is not always the TV drama type dream.
Paiz s home away from home Station 66 is new a replacement for the 61 year old Florence Avenue facility that was condemned because it was not earthquake proof.
Central air conditioning is one new perk.
Since the early morning fire things have been monotonously quiet at Station 66.
30 Rick Ramirez today s cook announces over the PA It is Mexican stew with frijoles rice and tortillas.
Just as everyone digs in the engine company gets a call.
Mop up help is needed at a Griffith Park brush fire.
soon after in South Central the truck Paiz s detail handles an accident a Suzuki motorcycle and car collision.
Back at the station there is dinner to be finished and a surfing competition on TV.
Then while it is still daylight Ventura takes the truck company to a site at 64th Street and West Boulevard a condemned property where there have been several recent arson fires.
Then the crew responds to a house in Inglewood where hot wires have been blown down.
Last Friday firefighters helped put out a blaze at the 2nd A.
This day they return to inspect the church where there are fire fighting lessons to be learned.
In the vestibule a huge chandelier lies on the tile floor.
luckily it struck his compressed air tank.
Some attribute that to smoke detectors to education to an influx of ethnic groups who do not call firefighters because they think they will have to pay and are embarrassed to seek help.
The engine crew which includes one woman Mary Kay Intyre a policewoman turned firefighter returns before midnight from Griffith Park.
Paiz and the others all but the paramedics get an uninterrupted night s sleep a rarity at Station 66.
It never fails Ventura says when there are ride alongs.
THE EPA SAYS THE FORMER OWNERS OF THE BURBANK FIRM CAN BE FINED UP TO THREE TIMES THE 1.
The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday began cleaning up thousands of gallons of hazardous chemicals at a former Burbank metal plating shop that was abandoned by its owners.
Officials expect the removal of about 36 000 gallons of industrial solvents and other chemicals at Dynamic Plating to take about five weeks.
The action is designed to prevent reactive chemicals from mixing.
Although the chemicals used in various plating processes do not pose a significant health risk by themselves they are potentially very dangerous when mixed said Dan Shane who is coordinating the cleanup.
An emergency work order issued by the EPA said the combination of acids with cyanide solutions stored nearby could cause the release of hydrogen cyanide which EPA spokesman Terry Wilson declined to elaborate or speculate on the effects of such a gas release.
Tests also will be conducted to determine if seepage from the shop has contributed to ground water contamination in the southeast San Fernando Valley.
Soil samples already taken at the site indicate a "significant amount" of solvents have seeped into the ground over the years.
High levels of solvents were detected at depths of up to 55 feet and officials suspect that other chemicals also might have found their way into the soil.
The building was built as Army barracks during World War II and had been used as a plating shop since at least 1959.
Because of the wood framed building s age and dilapidated condition officials feared there was a significant risk of chemicals spilling or mixing.
The shop which is in a light industrial area near Burbank and Victory boulevards has been closed since January according to city records.
At that time city officials cited shop owners Frank Guerrero and Chuck Ceballos for exceeding their permitted limits on the amount of waste they were flushing into the sewer system.
An assessment of the shop by the EPA in August revealed several open vats and sumps containing 36 000 gallons of chemicals and various industrial wastes.
On Monday about a dozen workers prepared the site for cleanup by removing empty containers and evaluating the potential risks.
A portable meteorological station was erected to forecast the spread of a toxic cloud in the event any of the chemicals combine during the cleanup.
The EPA can fine Guerrero and Ceballos up to three times that amount.
But Guerrero and Ceballos have indicated to city and federal officials that they are unable to pay for the cleanup.
Sidney Troxell an attorney for the two men declined to discuss how they plan to settle the bill.
He said Guerrero and Ceballos were considering declaring bankruptcy but had not made a final decision.
Shane said the first priority at the site will be to pump reactive chemicals into storage tanks and remove them thus eliminating the immediate risk of toxic mixture.
Work then will concentrate on removing chemical containers and disposing of them in an approved facility.
Tests also will be conducted to determine the amount of contamination caused by chemicals seeping into the soil.
DAM SPILLS 9 MILLION GALLONS OF SODIUM CYANIDE.
About 9 million gallons of potentially hazardous sodium cyanide spilled Sunday from a reservoir into a nearby creek when a dam broke authorities said.
The spill posed little threat to drinking supplies but officials warned residents to keep animals from tainted water.
The substance a poisonous chemical when undiluted spilled from a reservoir at Brewer Gold Co.
when a dam broke said Richard Carnes emergency preparedness director in Chesterfield County.
Heavy rain might have weakened the dam along the reservoir.
Sodium cyanide spilled into Little Fork Creek about 2 000 feet from the reservoir.
The creek flows into Lynches River about two miles from the spill.
The company uses the chemical to separate gold from ore.
Georgetown about 110 miles southeast of Jefferson is the nearest municipality to draw drinking water from the lake system.
said Thom Berry spokesman for the state Department of Health and Environmental Control.
The reservoir held 13 million to 14 million gallons of sodium cyanide Berry said.
Results of water quality tests would not be available until today.
Consumption of undiluted sodium cyanide can be fatal but it is significantly weakened when mixed with water Berry said.
STATE ISSUES RANGE FROM GROWTH TO GAY MARRIAGE.
Oakland will select a new mayor San Francisco will again decide whether to recognize gay couples as symbolically married and Inyo County will vote on the political fate of its Board of Supervisors in some of Tuesday s less glamorous elections.
Around California growth measures and traffic controls also are on the ballot in several locales.
And in Yucaipa near San Bernardino two school board members face recall in a dispute over whether a set of reading books encourages Satanism.
Oakland s mayoral candidates are both 43 year old black leaders and liberal Democrats state Assemblyman Elihu Harris and City Councilman Wilson Riles Jr.
Harris has campaigned against redevelopment plans for the city s Jack London Square and a downtown shopping complex while Riles most recently led the effort that stymied a costly plan to lure the Los Angeles Raiders football team back to Oakland.
Early in the campaign Riles voluntarily took a drug test it came back negative and attacked Harris for refusing a test.
Harris who had advocated drug tests for arrested juveniles said the test was not necessary because he does not use drugs.
Harris a state legislator since 1978 has raised more than twice as much money as Riles and appears to be the front runner to replace Lionel Wilson an architect of the fateful Raiders deal who lost the mayor s office in the June primary after three terms.
Wilson who once considered Harris a political protege has endorsed Riles formerly the mayor s political nemesis.
In San Francisco the question of offering legal standing to gay couples who choose to register at City Hall is again on the ballot.
The so called "domestic parters" law was rejected in past elections but this time the measure provides none of the official benefits of marriage.
Still it has been controversial matching the moral sway of Roman Catholic church leaders against the city s liberal political leanings.
Growth along the waterfront also is an issue in San Francisco.
One measure on Tuesday s ballot would encourage the large Mission Bay development in China Basin by waiving the city s stringent growth controls.
Another measure would suspend waterfront development in San Francisco to allow more thorough planning.
On the east side of the Sierra Nevada three members of the Inyo County Board of Supervisors face a recall driven by resentment of a water deal they negotiated with the city of Los Angeles.
A fourth incumbent supervisor also is seeking reelection on the ballot.
Defeat of the incumbents would scotch the water deal with Los Angeles and could lead to new legal challenges to the city s century old practice of gathering water in Owens Valley.
In Yucaipa a community of suburbs and horse ranches against the hills east of San Bernardino two school board members face recall for approving a set of reading books called "Impressions" that some parents say is anti Christian and unsuitable for children.
Alternative classes have been offered to children whose parents object to the books but the issue has remained divisive as it has in other small towns around the West.
of Public Instruction Bill Honig went to Yucaipa last week to lend moral support to the school board and was jeered by parents some of whom called him a "Satanist.
" Elsewhere in Southern California the most divisive Orange County measure would raise the sales tax by a half cent to pay for projects that at least in theory would ease traffic congestion.
In San Diego County voters are confronted with two confusing growth control measures.
They were placed on the ballot in a miscalculation by the construction industry and many developers now oppose the measures.
Developers feared that more stringent laws would be offered by slow growth advocates and tried to beat them to the ballot with more moderate plans.
But the stricter controls never materialized and now the propositions measures D and M have no active supporters.
They are opposed both by some builders who say they will cost too much and slow growth groups that call them "backward steps.
" The office of San Diego County sheriff also is up for grabs because John Duffy who held it for 20 years decided not to run after several years of controversy about jail overcrowding and a security system at his home.
Goleta north of Santa Barbara and three towns in Riverside County Canyon Lake Murrieta and Calimesa will decide whether to incorporate as cities.
Around Northern California Marin and Sonoma counties will vote Tuesday on whether to raise the sales tax to pay for measures to ease rush hour traffic.
Most of the money would be for freeway improvements such as car pool lanes but a sizable chunk also would go toward a light rail line that could cross the two counties.
Marin and Sonoma pulled out of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in the 1960s and thus do not enjoy the rail service that links many suburbs there with downtown San Francisco.
The question of urban growth in the nearby Napa Valley wine region also will be considered.
Measure J in Napa County would require a public vote before any more vineyards or farm land could be rezoned to allow the construction of homes and stores.
In the Bay Area the fate of the San Francisco Giants will be decided by a set of complex ballot measures in five cities.
The Giants want a stadium built in Santa Clara but the five cities first must approve a utility tax and a measure that would provide 98 acres of land.
Elsewhere in the north Sacramento County will vote on an advisory measure that asks if the County Board of Supervisors should push for building the large Auburn Dam on the American River.
In the Sierra foothills Tuolumne County voters will decide whether to slap controls on growth of the Jamestown gold mine which uses cyanide to extract the ore.
FINDS IN CUYAMACA MOUNTAINS SPAWNED AREAWIDE RUSH.
While few people know Southern California for its mineral wealth northern San Diego County from the Laguna Mountains in the east to the foothills of Escondido has contributed millions of dollars in gold to the Golden State.
San Diego s best known mining period the Julian gold rush of 1870 began when rancher Fred Coleman spotted gold in a creek in the Cuyamaca Mountains.
When Coleman spread word of his discovery scores of prospectors raced to the hills to pan for placer gold in the mountain streams.
The miners formed a mining district and a town of tents emerged called Emily City.
In San Diego skepticism over the strike vanished when a load of 1 500 pounds of gold ore arrived in town in March 1870.
The arrival of so large a quantity of rich gold bearing quartz created intense excitement in town.
A stampede immediately ensued and the road has now for several days been lined with teams of every description and men mounted and on foot in route to the mines.
From persons who returned yesterday we learned that there are now on the ground not less than 600 persons and the number is daily increasing.
Julian gold fever soon infected the whole of the Southwest.
Miners poured into the region from San Francisco via steamer or overland from Los Angeles.
The miners found lode gold in several hillside areas.
The claims bore formal names such as George Washington Mount Vernon The Monroe and U.
Grant as well as novel titles such as Shoo Fly April Fool You Bet and Don t Bother Me.
The first significant town site was laid out by homesteader Drury Bailey and named "Julian City" after his cousin Mike Julian.
A tent city at first Julian grew in two years to a population of nearly 2 000 half the size of San Diego.
At its gold rush peak the town boasted two hotels two cafes five stores two blacksmith shops two livery stables a school a race track and uncounted saloons and dance halls.
The town became important politically after Mike Julian was appointed county assessor (an attempt to move the county seat to Julian from San Diego failed).
Branson City Eastwood and Coleman City (Emily City).
Banner located a few miles southwest of Julian became a sizeable town.
The mining boom of Julian Banner lasted less than five years.
In 1873 the camps produced 500 000 in gold but late in the year plans for the long anticipated Texas and Pacific Railroad collapsed.
Gold production began to decline and by 1876 most of the mines had closed.
The population of Julian fell to less than 100 people and Banner became a ghost town.
The late 1800s saw a major revival in mining helped by the completion of railroad connections to the north.
The new rail and stage lines promoted fresh interest in mining ventures.
The most successful activity came from the Stonewall Mine south of Julian.
Gold mining was not confined to the mountains of the northeast county.
The Cleveland Pacific Oro Fino and Cravath mines located only 2 miles southeast of the Escondido city hall produced about 150 000 (at 20 per ounce) in the early century.
The Cleveland Pacific Mining Company developed the most important site from 1896 through 1911.
A 350 foot incline shaft followed a vein of gold bearing quartz.
Ore was processed at the site using a five stamp mill and 10 foot high tanks of cyanide.
Slow activity continued from the 1920s until about 1932 when all mining stopped and the shafts were dynamited shut.
Citrus and avocado groves soon covered all traces of the mines.
Reminders of the San Diego County gold producing days still exist though.
Old mine dumps near the junction of San Pasqual Valley Road and Bear Valley Parkway can be seen today as low hills.
The site of the Stonewall Mine near the southeast shore of Cuyamaca Reservoir is clearly marked within Cuyamaca State Park and easily reached by visitors.
The Eagle High Peak Mine of Julian produces gold to this day and even provides guided tours of the diggings.
Doubters need only look to the minerals mining industry a business so addicted to government handouts that it apparently can barely lift a shovel without taxpayer help.
It s a leader in boron and gypsum too producing 3 billion a year in non fuel minerals overall and ranking second only to Arizona.
But the interesting thing about minerals mining is how perfectly its checkered history recapitulates much of what ails American business.
Here was a mighty industry built on dazzling natural abundance and unbridled domestic growth.
It was blessed with sweetheart legislation and enjoyed a degree of worldwide pre eminence.
But it resisted innovation relying instead on its ability to extract private profit at public expense especially by ignoring the cost of the environmental degradation that it had a habit of leaving behind.
Times got tough in the early 1980s and the industry was brutally restructured.
The result nowadays is a scaled down but profitable 30 billion a year business that seems to lack the will and possibly the wherewithal to invest in its own future.
In California tougher environmental rules and lower grade ores will increasingly demand higher technology but the minerals and metals companies aren t likely to have it.
says the startling new report of a special panel commissioned by the National Research Council which advises the government on such things.
By contrast federal spending on mining research excluding safety was 86 million in fiscal 1989.
Ray Beebe vice chairman of the panel and an astute senior vice president at Homestake Mining Co.
California s 1989 output was 367 million second only to Nevada s.
Bureau of Mines research into "heap leaching" soaking pulverized rock in cyanide to extract the ore.
The technique is so cheap that it can pay to mine 20 tons of rock for one ounce of gold and it was developed partly at taxpayer expense when gold was cheap.
gold mining industry probably spends less than 7 million of its own on research and development annually.
The study panel recommends greater cooperation between government universities and mining companies to make the technological leaps the industry so badly needs.
Given the industry s history that omission is perhaps less than startling.
Corporate welfare is practically second nature to these folks.
Much of American minerals mining occurs on federal land and thanks to a classic government giveaway mining interests pay Uncle Sam nothing for the ores they extract.
The mining law of 1872 drafted and guided through Congress by mining industry mouthpiece and Nevada Sen.
William Morris Stewart lets miners reap minerals on federal lands for free.
if a miner or mining concern really likes a tract they can buy it for 5 an acre or less.
Traditionally miners took the ore and left behind a mess but when the land is worth keeping they take it.
Reviewing 20 such deals since 1970 the General Accounting Office found that the government got less than 4 500 for lands valued in 1988 at 13.
Predictable horror stories include the giveaway of federal lands in suburban Phoenix and Las Vegas and next to ski resorts.
In 1985 miners paid 170 for 34 federal acres near Sonora Calif.
local realtors figured the land was worth perhaps 510 000.
Since 1872 a combined area larger than Connecticut has been ceded this way nationwide.
land and mineral giveaways have historically characterized settlement of the West but by now the government gets decently paid for oil gas coal and timber from its our land.
Nor does it routinely cede title without charge.
Gold copper gypsum and other such minerals remain the great exception.
Nobody seems to know what proportion of mining revenue is drawn from federal lands a group lobbying to change the law guesses 4 billion a year but even the American Mining Congress the trade and lobbying group admits that most known metallic mineral reserves in the West are on U.
An 8 royalty plan died in Congress last year but is likely to be revived soon.
Aghast the industry says that exacting payment for the minerals will hurt the competitiveness of U.
mining companies and that tampering with the law will let environmentalists change it somehow so they can tie the miners up in litigation.
No property owner in his right mind would buy that.
Anyone who finds gold in my back yard is going to pay me for it and California among other states agrees.
Like environmental regulations government royalty or leasing requirements will raise the lowest level of ore the companies can profitably mine at least until new technologies come along.
But these are unlikely considering the sorry state of the industry s knowledge infrastructure.
California s only full four year mining program is at UC Berkeley where undergraduate enrollment in the field is a dismal 14.
Mike Hood a Berkeley mining professor who looked into this says enrollment at the six major Western mining colleges is down 80 since the 1970s.
Bureau of Mines staffing is off 20 since 1980 and its research spending is way down.
But before you get mad at the miners and we re not talking about the odd grizzled prospector here although they re also to blame remember that the industry isn t unusually greedy in all this.
Hood says prior advances in technology helped mining bounce back from its 1980s depression.
NEWMONT MINING North America s biggest gold producer has signed a protocol of agreement to process ore stockpiled at Muruntau in newly independent Uzbekistan reputed to be the world s biggest open pit gold mine.
8m troy ounces of gold a year from reserves which will last until about 2 040.
However it has stockpiled low grade material from which milling cannot extract enough gold.
Under the terms of the proposed joint venture with the Uzbekistan government Newmont will build huge plastic pads on which this low grade ore will be piled and the gold leached out with a cyanide water mixture.
Heap leach technology revolutionised gold mining in North America and Australia in the past 20 years and Newmont claims to be the world s largest user at its mines on the Carlin Trend in Nevada.
Analysts estimate it will cost between USDollars 70m and Dollars 75m for crushing equipment and to build the leach pads and associated plant at Muruntau which is about 250 miles north west of Tashkent.
The contract which Mr James Hill Newmont s vice president corporate relations said could be signed as early as March calls for Newmont to process 150m tonnes of stockpiled material over the next 20 years.
This should extract between 180 000 and 360 000 ounces of gold a year which would be sold for the equal benefit of the government and Newmont.
Mr Hill hoped this would lead to more contracts between Newmont (which has Sir James Goldsmith the Anglo French financier as its biggest shareholder) and Uzbekistan the second largest gold producer among the former Soviet republics.
He hoped the Muruntau arrangement would attract the interest and support of western banks.
FT 03 DEC 92 Engineers divert river in race to shore up weakened dam.
Kerin Hope watches as Montenegro tackles an environmental hazard.
ENGINEERS have held off the threatened collapse of a dam holding back millions of tonnes of toxic mining waste by diverting a river in the mountains of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
But United Nations advisers have warned that a 150 metre length of the 600 metre dam is still in danger of crumbling.
It s against all theory that this part should still be standing said Mr Thomas Dolder a Swiss civil engineer.
It has to be filled at once otherwise even heavy rain could be disastrous.
The weakening of the dam has turned into a major environmental hazard for the Danube river system.
Environmentalists have warned that if the dam collapses the mountain of toxic sludge it has been holding back will poison the Tara river and eventually the Danube.
The 12 metre high dam made of compacted sand and gravel rises in a mountainous gorge at Mojkovac in Montenegro a republic which along with Serbia makes up what remains of the old federation of Yugoslavia.
The dam was damaged by two flash floods on October 6 and 17 when surging water swept away concrete slabs at its base.
But now the fast flowing river Tara has been channelled to the other side of the rocky gorge.
At the same time a temporary breakwater is preventing the dam from further erosion while workers race against time to build an access ramp to start replacing 5 000 cubic metres of lost filling.
At the moment only a thin wall of gravel backed with plastic sheeting is stopping some 3.
5m tonnes of sludge containing lead cadmium and cyanide from slipping into the river.
It would be carried down the Tara into the Drina river and then the Danube poisoning aquatic life and drinking water.
The Tara a Unesco protected water flowing between two national parks is one of Montenegro s main tourist attractions.
The protests of people living at Mojkovac were ignored in 1976 when the government decided to re open an abandoned lead and zinc mine and when an East German company built an ore processing plant just outside the town.
The mine was eventually shut down last year after its toxic waste had built up to the present proportions.
The waste pipes from the plant cover a 20 hectare area.
A hard crust two metres thick covers sludge with the consistency of pudding Mr Dolder said.
The sludge now appears to be slowly moving forward and adding to the pressure on the weak dam he said.
Despite efforts by local officials and the UN disaster relief organisations to keep the dam repair programme on track the slow pace of work is causing anxiety.
The UN last week flew in 1 600 sealed cages which will be filled with rock and used as a core for three permanent breakwaters directing the river away from the dam.
But the Montenegrin public works ministry in charge of rebuilding the dam has had trouble finding local contractors who can provide bulldozers and other earth moving equipment.
We are in the process of moving from state control to a private system in the building industry and there is a lot of confusion said one official.
The United Nations lifted trade sanctions against Montenegro (which has been allied with Serbia in the bitter fighting between Yugoslav ethnic groups) in order to send in equipment for repairing the dam.
The operation is being hampered by a severe shortage of petrol one of the main results of the embargo against the rump state of Yugoslavia.
More requests for exemption from the UN embargo will have to be made so as to procure additional equipment needed to complete the rebuilding work.
Drilling machinery and explosives for instance are in short supply at the quarry where hundreds of huge boulders will have to be extracted to shore up the dam.
FT 04 DEC 92 Toxic town plays for time at the edge of hell.
5m tons of metallic waste threaten an environmental disaster.
FOR 15 years the town of Mojkovac in Montenegro part of the rump of Yugoslavia watched the dam covering what used to be its football pitch fill up with millions of tons of poisonous mining waste.
In the summer the water on top evaporated and gave off a mist that affected people s breathing.
We knew the dump was hazardous but our requests for a study were ignored for years says Mr Miso Stanisic the mayor.
Mojkovac s problem now threatens to turn into an international environmental disaster.
Freak floods in October caused the Tara river to burst its banks washing away the base of the dam along a quarter of its 600 metre length.
Despite United Nations assisted efforts to repair the dam over the past two weeks there is still serious risk that the damaged part may collapse releasing some of the 3.
5m tons of toxic waste it contains into the Tara which flows into the Danube above Belgrade.
Below a sandy crust the sludge is extremely unstable and it is steadily pushing forward against the weak part of the dam.
It could give way at any time said Mr Thomas Dolder a civil engineer advising the UN disaster relief organisation.
Even a relatively small discharge could kill fish and aquatic plants in the Tara a Unesco protected waterway which the Montenegrans call the cleanest river in Europe and make the water undrinkable in the Drina Sava and Danube rivers all the way to the Black Sea.
Floods the worst that anyone in Mojkovac can remember could not have come at a more difficult moment given that Montenegro is included in the UN embargo on trade with Yugoslavia and now has little contact with the rest of Europe.
It was several weeks before the republic s request for aid following the floods reached the UN.
Although sanctions were lifted to permit the delivery of 1 600 steel cages and other dam protection equipment Montenegran officials blamed the embargo for the slow pace of repairs.
While floodlights are positioned around the dump allowing for round the clock activity there are no light bulbs to be found.
According to UN divers the dam be touched up in just two days if work speeded up sufficiently.
However fuel is only available on the black market at high prices and Montenegro s new private contractors are not necessarily willing to accept the low rate offered by the public works ministry responsible for repairs.
Some of Mojkovac s 11 000 residents will even admit to wishing the dump could be washed downstream and out of their lives.
Launched in 1976 the Briskovo zinc and lead mine project was supposed to boost the local economy by reopening a Medieval mine that had provided silver for Serbia s first coinage.
At its peak the mine produced 4 500 tonnes of lead and zinc annually but only a small quantity of silver.
It was considered a successful enterprise bringing in about Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.
9m) a year so nobody paid much attention to the effects of the dump says Mr Borislav Medovejic the director of the ore processing plant.
Up to 35 000 tonnes a year of sludge containing high levels of both zinc and lead as well as other heavy metals like mercury and cadmium were poured into the dam.
The dam made of compacted sand and gravel was lined with thick plastic sheeting to prevent the metal residue from seeping into the ground water.
When production at the mine was stepped up in 1980 in response to demand from Zorka Savac the federal Yugoslav mineral exporting company the dam had to be enlarged.
It s in the past two years that we really started to notice the effect of living next to the dump.
The number of lung cancer cases has doubled and there have been 18 suicides which I attribute to the effect of mercury on the central nervous system says Dr Radovan Jovanovic head of the town s medical centre.
When the mine shut down last year after the Yugoslavs lost their market in the former Soviet Union it looked as if Mojkovac s increasingly active ecological association would at last get a hearing.
The republic s post communist government is keen to underline its concern for the environment.
A plan was begun for covering the 20 hectare site with a thick layer of clay and topsoil.
Even if we manage to secure the dam the waste cannot just be covered up.
There is proably lead and zinc left because of inefficient extraction to make further processing commercially viable.
But after that s done it will still be very expensive to make the site safe Mr Dolder said.
5m tons of toxic waste lead zinc cadmium cyanide contained by the 600m long Jaloviste dam alongside the Tara River in the mountains of Montenegro 2 The flood swollen Tara damages 150 metres of the compaced sand and gravel dam last month threatening to cause what UN officials say could become an absolute disaster 3 The system of back fill and stacked gabions chicken wire cages filled with gravel or crushed stone which UN engineers are now racing to erect by Christmas 4 At stake say UN officials is not only the poisoning of everything that lives in the Tara but probably in the Danube as well as it flows from Belgrade to the Black Sea.
Freak flooding hits desert copper mines.
AMERICAN COPPER companies are assessing the financial damage they suffered when freak storms dumped half the average annual rainfall on the Arizona desert in only ten days.
The region accounts for about 10 per cent of the western world s copper mine production.
The deluge flooded open pit mines washed away rail links and diluted the cyanide solutions used to leach metal from ore dumps more usually drenched in sunshine.
Companies said yesterday it might take several weeks to gauge the impact on copper production and add up the extra costs.
There are four important copper producers operating in Arizona Asarco Cyprus Minerals Magma Copper and Phelps Dodge with about 15 mines and three smelters.
Mr David Ridinger president of the Arizona Mining Association summed up the situation by pointing out that in an average year the town of Phoenix expected seven inches of rain.
In 1992 double that amount fell on the town in January alone this year there was five inches of rain.
We ve been hit by three or four storms and tornadoes which just would not quit he added.
The usually dry river bed running through Phoenix was now half a mile wide with 100 000 cubic feet a second of water rushing through.
We ve sometimes had an inch of rain in half an hour and this is a desert so there s no vegetation to stop it running.
Phoenix is not a mining town but miners with property near the river have been more interested in protecting their homes than going to work said Mr Ridinger.
The mining companies biggest problem was dealing with the water he said.
Environmental regulations prevented them from simply pumping water out of pits threatened with flooding.
It had to be pumped to areas perhaps disused pits were it could be contained until it was analysed for any contamination.
Apart from diluting the cyanide solutions sprinkled on the out door heaps of ore the rain also washed mud into the so called pregnant ponds where solutions heavy with metal are stored.
This was causing gunk problems when the solutions were processed.
Rumours that Asarco s smelter at Hayden had been forced to shut because of the weather conditions were dismissed by the company which said the plant had been scheduled to close between January 12 and February 17 for routine maintenance.
However Asarco s Hayden concentrator shut down because the rail line linking it with the Ray mine was flooded.
Some metal solution had spilled into the nearby Mineral Creek but tests showed there had been no environmental damage and none was expected in future.
Magma had to stop production at its Pinto Valley mine which has an average annual output of 90 000 tonnes of copper because of flooding.
An official said there was at least 26 feet of water in one area.
However Magma s San Manuel mine and associated smelting refining operations accounting for about 25 per cent of US copper smelting capacity were not affected.
An official at Phelps Dodge the biggest US copper group said.
We haven t lost any copper it s just taking longer to get it out.
The deluge however would increase the group s costs because a Southern Pacific rail link was washed away and material from the Morenci mine was being sent by road to the smelter 100 miles away.
Cyprus was also forced to switch concentrate shipments to trucks because the East Arizona Railways line linked with its Miami smelter was washed away.
A Cyprus official said Arizona producers were swapping copper concentrates with one another to ensure production continued and sales commitments were met.
FT 20 MAR 93 End of the lode for gold thieves.
A British geologist in Australia has found a way to fingerprint the metal.
THE GOLD thief could not believe his bad luck.
Like nearly everyone else in the business he was convinced that the origins of what he had stolen were untraceable once identification marks had been removed.
Yet the expert prosecution witness was telling the court with uncanny accuracy how the thief had gone about disguising them.
The witness said the metal had been melted and some 18 carat scrap gold added before it was melted again.
The accused man was so astounded that he changed his plea to guilty and then admitted he had indeed done everything claimed.
Dr John Watling the expert witness was so elated that he almost asked the judge to let the thief go free.
For the case was a crucial step in establishing that gold finger printing really does work.
This technological breakthrough affects not just gold thieves.
it will make life much more difficult for fraudsters and drug barons the world over.
Before long Watling s work will result in much of the world s gold being finger printed so that its origins can be pinpointed with certainty.
In this way it will cease to be an untraceable international currency.
This will for example make laundering drug receipts more difficult.
One way in which drug rings move their money into the mainstream banking system is to buy gold mining land or even old mines.
Stolen gold is bought with the illicit cash and is then mixed with dirt and possibly some metal from the mine or mining area.
The metal then goes to a refinery which has no way of knowing it is not newly mined gold.
Watling s system also will help to prove that mines have been salted a confidence trick as old as the industry itself.
Watling 42 is a British geologist and geo chemist born at Helsden near Norwich.
Educated at Imperial College London he has for the past two years been in charge of the West Australian government s minerals science laboratory in Perth.
He started work on his finger printing theory about 10 years ago when it occurred to him that the 70 80 elements in gold might be brought together in a unique way whenever a specific deposit was formed.
It was only a short step from proving the theory to finding a practical application.
That came when he gave evidence in a case where the accused claimed that gold in his possession came from South Africa.
Watling showed that it actually originated from a West Australian field.
Because said Watling South African gold has significant concentrations of palladium ruthenium platinum osmium and iridium.
Watling needs only a very small trace of gold for his work.
The sample is cut by a laser linked with a plasma mass spectrometer.
The technique is similar to to traditional human finger printing in that a jury can simply be shown patterns on sheets of paper to compare one gold sample with another.
Watling says the first case to use gold finger printing was the most difficult because his team had to go to great lengths to get the details absolutely right.
Today defence lawyers in Western Australia no longer question the validity of the technique which has been used in 17 gold theft cases.
This is particularly important in a state where it is estimated that at least 2 per cent of the gold mined is stolen an annual loss worth about ADollars 2.
Part of the reason for this is that in the West Australian fields stealing gold is not considered a particularly serious crime.
This attitude dates back to the days when miners were paid a pittance for working underground in difficult and dangerous conditions.
When occasionally a miner found a gold nugget among the ore the temptation to pocket it often was irresistible.
Today most of Western Australia s gold is spread in invisible specks through the ore which is dug from open pits by construction equipment and put through a chemical recovery process.
But every one of the 29 pubs in Kalgoorlie the town at the heart of the state s eastern goldfields still has its gold buyer someone willing to give cash for the metal with no questions asked.
And while it is unusual to find a nugget the new technology used in the goldfields does not deter determined thieves.
A wire wool pad suspended discretely in a mine s carbon in leach tank will collect about two troy ounces of gold a day worth nearly ADollars 900.
Thieves take gold impregnated carbon and use oxy acetylene equipment to burn away the charcoal to get at the gold.
They even take the so called pregnant solution a mixture of water cyanide and gold and set up their own processing operations to extract the gold.
To combat all this the West Australian Gold Producers Association working through the Chamber of Mines and Energy uses the services of the Kalgoorlie based Gold Stealing Detection Unit.
This is part of the state s police force but is hired out to the private sector.
Its present head Det Senior Sgt Darryl Lockhart says that unless it is obvious a gold theft case can be resolved quickly in court all samples and exhibits go to Watling s laboratory for testing.
So far Watling has finger printed 60 mines and 40 bullion samples from Western Australia and is now finger printing more than 200 samples from South Africa and Russia.
He and some colleagues are soon to publish a paper making the technique available to other scientists.
Protection for a final frontier Victor Mallet visits the island of Palawan an environmental test case for south east Asia.
THE SIGN at the Bottleground bar on Rizal Avenue boasts.
With its brothels and Roman Catholic churches there is not much at first glance to distinguish Puerto Princesa the capital of the island province of Palawan from any other town in the Philippines.
A typical family owns an old videotape of the wedding of Britain s Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer and has eight children.
Seven masses are celebrated each Sunday at the Immaculate Conception cathedral to accommodate the growing number of inhabitants.
Religion even penetrates the underground river Palawan s main tourist attraction see this stalactite it is like the Virgin Mary declares the boatman to his sceptical passengers.
And this one he points at another apparently shapeless rock is like the Holy Family.
In one very important sense however Palawan is different.
Elsewhere in the Philippines almost all the tropical forest has been destroyed but about half of this long thin mountainous island south west of Manila is still covered with trees.
Elsewhere coral reefs have been dynamited into oblivion but in the waters around Palawan much of the coral and other forms of marine life have survived making the area a paradise for divers and the source of two thirds of the fish for the national capital Metro Manila.
Palawan has become a test case not just for the Philippines but for south east Asia as a whole.
Stop illegal fishing declares the roadside billboard in Puerto Princesa.
Another billboard shows the diminishing size of fish caught over the past 20 years and urges fishermen to stop using cyanide which does not discriminate between baby and mature fish and therefore needlessly decimates fish populations.
The presence of the billboards is both bad news and good news.
The bad news is that the battle to save Palawan s resources for the future is an uphill struggle.
the good news is that a few members of the central and local governments are starting to take the matter seriously.
The very fact that Palawan is relatively undamaged and undisturbed by separatist or communist rebels makes the island a favoured destination both for poor migrants from other parts of the Philippines and for foreign tourists.
Migrants follow the logging companies bulldozers to clear farmland for rice cashew nuts or coconuts and the tourists come to find the tranquillity now lost in much of the rest of south east Asia.
Palawan also has oil offshore and nickel deposits in the south but the financial benefits even when they come to the island rather than to the central government or to big business are clouded by the inevitable disadvantages.
The island s population has doubled to about 600 000 in the past decade and Puerto Princesa is starting to smell of the diesel smoke and motor cycle fumes generated by trucks and tricycle taxis.
one of the nickel companies is being accused of polluting a river with laterite waste.
there are fears that the gold prospectors who have recently rushed to the north of the island will poison fresh water with the mercury they use to separate their gold from sand.
and there are increasing signs that deforestation is causing the erosion of land silting of rivers and fresh water shortages which have plagued other islands in the Philippines.
A moratorium on commercial logging in Palawan was imposed last year and more recently the authorities banned the transport of live fish which had been exported from the island to aquariums and to Chinese restaurants.
Enforcement of environmental regulations however is hard it s very difficult says Mr Felipe Ortiz the chief of forest management at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in Puerto Princesa.
There are many people in the city and it s still a developing city.
Furthermore big businessmen backed by private armies are still keen to export logs in defiance of the official ban.
Court cases filed against those who violate timber laws are sometimes mysteriously dismissed local officials say.
But the election of a new mayor and a more enlightened local government for the capital Puerto Princesa in May last year has given a boost to Palawan s environmental campaigners.
Before they (the old officials) made lots of speeches about conservation but meanwhile their people were out cutting trees says Mr Ortiz.
In 1991 14 members of Haribon Palawan the island s main environmental group were charged with subversion and harassment although the charges were eventually dropped.
Now Haribon workers carry walkie talkies provided by the local authorities so the two sides can work as a team.
The resounding defeat of Mr Ramon Mitra the former speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives in last year s presidential election is also a bonus for the environmentalists since he was regarded as the political patron of Mr Jose Alvarez a businessman from outside the island who has taken a leading role in the logging industry in Palawan.
Palawan s new mood of co operation between the local authorities environmentalists and inhabitants was underlined at a recent ceremony in the district of Tagabinet attended by Haribon representatives and local officials.
Twenty two members of the Batak and Tagbanua tribes were awarded stewardship certificates giving them the right (under a national plan to control upland cultivation) to occupy and farm their land near the St Paul s national park.
In exchange they must undertake not to expand their clearing by cutting down forest trees.
Mr Mil Reynoso the vice mayor of Puerto Princesa said too much deforestation would turn the country into a desert like Iraq it affects the personality of the people there he said.
It is by no means certain that the farmers fully understand their obligations under the scheme one drunken smallholder immediately asked whether it was all right if he chopped down a protected species of tree because it was good for building houses but at least a start has been made in winning the support of the inhabitants of Palawan for efforts to preserve the island s resources.
Mr Joselito Alisuag the activist lawyer who heads Haribon Palawan is relieved that he finally has a few allies in the city hall.
We used to fight everyone he says as he fingers his walkie talkie.
All for the birds Mining groups are anxious to protect wildlife.
Birds in Nevada now have new homes courtesy of Coeur d Alene Mines.
The company is attaching lightweight nesting boxes to its claim posts the posts used to mark boundaries when mining companies stake their claims.
The idea was developed by Rob Berry senior landsman with Coeur d Alene s exploration subsidiary.
He noticed that the hollow plastic boundary posts often claimed more than mining land.
Birds slipped into the open ends of the posts sometimes to nest in them and could not always escape.
Rather than simply capping the posts Berry developed the bird boxes which are folded together from one piece of corrugated cardboard and attached with some simple hardware.
The boxes are light enough for mineral exploration teams who frequently hike many miles into remote areas to carry several at a time.
Berry called on experts at the Nevada Department of Wildlife to help design the nesting boxes which were first tested last year at the group s Rochester mine in Nevada the largest primary silver mine in the US.
Berry s boxes are suitable for small birds bluebirds and wrens but larger ones have been designed to accommodate kestrels a species of owl and wood ducks.
This however is not just a simple story about a nature lover and a good idea.
Dead birds are a very big issue at open pit mines in the US.
Mining companies are spending millions of dollars to make sure that they do not fall foul of legislation such as the US Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
The act makes it illegal for any company or mine to kill migrating water fowl and every death has to be reported.
The mining method that causes difficulties is called heap leaching.
Ore is placed in a heap on an impermeable plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution is sprinkled over it.
The solution collects at the bottom after percolating through the ore and dissolving much of the metal.
This very low cost process has enabled gold and silver to be won from rock containing very little of the precious metals typically well under one ounce of gold in every tonne of ore and it contributed to the tremendous upsurge of gold mining activity in Australia as well as North America in the 1980s.
But tailings (waste) discharged into ponds after the gold has been separated from the solution still contains cyanide which takes some time to lose its toxicity in the sunlight.
Many of the US gold mines using heap leaching are in desert areas and when birds in the desert see a patch of blue water there is little that can be done to stop them if they want to drop in for a drink.
Most of the ponds are too large to be satisfactorily covered by netting heavy winter snows tend to tear it.
But at the Rochester mine Coeur d Alene tried this and various other methods to keep birds away from the cyanide solution.
To scare the birds away strips of polished aluminium were employed as well as propane cannons that exploded compressed gas with a loud bang at intervals.
Now the company is pioneering a closed loop leaching system that does away with the open ponds.
Instead the cyanide solution circulates without seeing the light of day and the pregnant or metal bearing solution is held in a closed tank before processing.
Even the drip irrigation facility is buried below the surface of the heap of ore on the leach pad.
All this obviously helps to protect birds and other wildlife.
But it has also reduced Rochester s costs by enabling leaching to go on year round without the heap freezing and by reducing the amount of cyanide and water used.
Coeur d Alene is now leaching out the same amount of metal with 4 000 gallons of solution against the previous 7 000 gallons.
Dennis Wheeler Coeur d Alene s president says the system helped to reduce the cash costs of production at Rochester from Dollars 3.
Environmental protection is a key element in the mining industry and it will remain so.
So he encourages a positive approach throughout the company an approach that led Berry to come forward with his bird house initiative and resulted in Coeur d Alene winning several environmental awards in the past five years.
This helps create a positive image for the mining industry in its battles with environmentalists.
Mining is a compatible use of the land and fully in keeping with the US tradition of multiple use of our lands.
He also insists that his shareholders recognise that money spent on environmental actions is well spent.
Our shareholders want to be part of an organisation that recognises a responsibility to the environment.
Race to move mountain of waste in the Rockies When spring melts the winter snow water carrying toxic heavy metals could bring death to the streams feeding the Rio Grande.
HIGH UP in Colorado s Rocky Mountains Hayes Griswold and his team are racing against time.
5m tonnes of dangerous mining waste back into the pit it came from.
They need to get as much of the work as possible done before winter sets in bringing some of the world s cruellest weather.
They know that if they don t succeed then in spring as the snow melts 1 000 gallons a minute of water polluted with toxic heavy metals will pour from the waste dump to threaten the streams that feed the Rio Grande River far below.
This is Summitville a gold mine that has come to epitomise all the worst aspects of modern mining.
It is a public relations disaster for the mining industry which has spent millions of dollars to promote the idea that modern mines do not create environmental problems.
Environmental groups everywhere point to Summitville as evidence that they do.
3m to move the dump at Summitville tip the waste back into the pit and treat it with neutralising materials.
Another Dollars 5m will be needed to treat the contaminated ground beneath the dump.
The bills are being paid by the US Environmental Protection Agency Hayes Griswold s employer.
The EPA is spending Dollars 50 000 a day to prevent a toxic mixture of cyanide and heavy metals spilling from the mine site.
The agency was forced to take emergency action early this year after the mine s owner Galactic Resources a Canadian company declared itself bankrupt.
But while narrowly averting an environmental catastrophe the EPA was plunged into a financial nightmare.
It estimates the final bill for cleaning up Summitville will be more than Dollars 100m.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is checking out events at the mine which within six days of going into production was leaking water contaminated with cyanide and heavy metals into the headwaters of the Alamosa River which supplies water to farms and ranches on its way to the Rio Grande.
Within a year it had poisoned all the fish in a reservoir 15 miles downstream and was corroding irrigation equipment used by farmers in the valley below.
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation is carrying out a parallel inquiry to establish if there have been violations of criminal laws at Summitville.
US law enables the EPA to claw back money for cleaning up a polluted site from any person or organisation in any way previously connected with that site.
The agency is investigating whether Vancouver based Galactic s bankruptcy means the company and its executives are insulated from these claw back provisions.
Among the EPA s prime targets is Robert Friedland aged 42 the Chicago born son of a German architect.
For the first six years of the mine s short life Mr Friedland was chairman of Galactic.
For much of that time he was also president and chief executive.
To develop the Summitville mine Mr Friedland raised more than CDollars 300m (Pounds 147.
7m) for Galactic much of it from European institutional investors particularly in Switzerland and the UK.
Today Mr Friedland s main corporate investment vehicle is a Vancouver investment company Ivanhoe Capital.
He has been promoting Vengold a company exploring for gold in Venezuela.
He is also negotiating with RTZ the UK based world s biggest mining company for a stake in the Lihir gold project in Papua New Guinea.
This is probably the biggest gold deposit in the world outside South Africa.
Mr Friedland has a considerable personal following among some investors.
He helped Vengold raise more than CDollars 50m in North America and Europe this year one of the biggest capital raising exercises by a Vancouver quoted company.
He was the executive driving force at Galactic when Summitville was commissioned.
Local legend has it that gold mining started at Summitville 12 500 ft up on the north east flank of the San Juan mountains 25 miles south west of Del Norte in Rio Grande County in 1750.
The skeletal remains of wooden buildings from mining activity in the 1870s still cling forlornly to the mountainside near the huge pit dug by Galactic after mining resumed in 1986.
Galactic used a technique known as cyanide heap leaching to recover gold from the ore it mined.
This process usually starts with the construction of an impermeable lined pad on the ground.
Then heaps of crushed ore are dumped on the pad and sprinkled with a cyanide solution that leaches the precious metal from the ore.
It is a process that has been used by the mining industry for many years.
But this was the first time it had been used on such a scale in Colorado or at such a height.
Cyanide started leaking from the Summitville ore heap almost immediately.
Yet rather than call a halt and order the pad to be repaired regulators from Colorado s state Mine Land Reclamation Board allowed Summitville to collect the contaminated water and pump it back up to the top of the heap.
Thus over ambitious management botched construction reckless mining and weak state government regulation combined to create one of the biggest scandals in recent mining history.
Summitville will likely be used as a case study of what can go wrong at a mine site says a report prepared for a group of mining industry and environmental organisations.
Summitville which was set up as a subsidiary of Galactic claimed that there was not enough flat land for a conventional heap leach pad.
It was allowed to dam a narrow valley and build a huge heap in it which was eventually 127 ft deep and spanned 48 acres.
A creek ran through the valley but Galactic simply lined the heap with plastic and ran a drain under it.
It also built an unlined waste pile without regulatory approval.
More water flowed into the heap than flowed out or evaporated creating a risk that toxic water would spill over the top.
Acidic water which dissolved the heavy metals such as copper zinc and iron in the waste material began to flow from the waste pile.
Cyanide started to leak into the creek and from there into the ground water.
The company tried to pump the leaking water back into the heap but that raised the water level at an alarming rate.
The Colorado authorities considered closing the mine but were worried about the loss of jobs and taxes.
The state also feared it would be left with the cost of an emergency clean up for which there were no state funds.
So Summitville was allowed to continue as long as it installed a water treatment plant.
There were more spills of water laced with cyanide and heavy metals.
The Colorado authorities then gave permission for contaminated water to be dispersed over 16 acres of nearby land.
The cocktail of cyanide and heavy metals flowed into nearby streams that feed the rivers below.
The Colorado Department of Health was alerted and when Mr Jim Horn one of its inspectors arrived at the mine contaminated water was not only flowing from the land disposal operations but also from nine other unauthorised discharges.
Literally there was 1 000 to 2 000 lbs of heavy metals iron zinc and copper leaving the site in dissolved form he says.
It was like adding half a Buick (car) a day to the Whiteman Fork that flows into the Alamosa.
There was no life in the river for 17 miles and no life in the Terrace Reservoir.
An anonymous telephone call sent the Environmental Protection Agency rushing to Summitville in September 1990.
Summitville paid Dollars 100 000 in civil penalties (on top of previous fines totalling Dollars 30 000).
As part of the settlement it started work on a plan to clean up the site.
By November 1992 this plan was ready showing the projected cost for the first phase alone would be Dollars 20m.
Neither Summitville nor its owner Galactic which had disposed of all its saleable assets to keep pace with the mine s financial demands had that kind of money.
Summitville declared itself bankrupt and said it would quit the site on December 15 1992.
Although Colorado insists that mining companies provide clean up bonds before they start operations Summitville had been asked for only Dollars 7.
5m of this had been handed back to help finance the early reclamation work.
7m to cover the clean up the state had no choice but to call on the EPA to use emergency powers to take over the mine.
The EPA whose income mainly comes from levies on the US chemical and oil industries is now footing the bill for the clean up.
The timing of the Summitville scandal could not be worse for the US mining industry.
President Bill Clinton has promised to change the mining laws which date back to 1872 and some claim are too favourable to the industry.
The Summitville story is being cited as proof that federal mining laws need toughening.
Mr Phil Hocker president of the Minerals Policy Centre a Washington based lobbying group says.
The mining industry is attempting to portray Summitville as an isolated atypical incident.
But it is typical of a whole class of incidents in the US because often the political and economic power of one industry in one particular state can be so intimidating that regulators cannot resist it.
There is a need for federal minimum standards to be set for mining.
This view is reinforced by a report on Summitville for Colorado s natural resources department by Mr Luke Danielson a Denver lawyer.
This suggests that permits for the mine were rushed through even before a reclamation plan had been prepared.
Then just as Summitville s problems were becoming clear Colorado drastically cut funding for the mined land reclamation programme leaving it understaffed demoralised and under equipped to cope effectively with a problem of this magnitude and complexity.
Colorado has already enacted virtually with no opposition sweeping reforms to its state mining laws.
The state is no longer as tolerant towards the mining industry says Mr Alan Salazar at the state Office of Policy and Initiative.
At the EPA Mr Robert Duprey director waste management division says.
The most important lesson from Summitville is that we must have financial assurances up front from mining companies.
Also we need a federal permitting process for dealing with hazardous waste.
We have a lot of historic mining clean up to do we don t want new ones.
Environmental activists in California Montana Oregon and Washington states are using the political ammunition provided by Summitville to call for an end to the use of sodium cyanide in mining which mining companies say is essential in some forms of gold and copper mining.
The Washington Wilderness Coalition has coined the telling phrase.
Summitville has also led to moves towards tighter mining legislation in Latin America.
Mr Oswaldo del Castillo mining expert at Venezuela s National Council for Investment Promotion says.
It is a relief to us that Mr Friedland is not involved in mining in Venezuela.
Mr Friedland says that because of the various investigations his lawyers advise him not to give interviews about Summitville.
But in a prepared statement he said that while he was an officer of Galactic he was never aware of any improper activity by any employee which would compromise the environment.
My primary role was attending to the financial affairs of the company.
There were numerous employees consultants and government agencies who were directly involved in technical evaluations and decisions at the mine site.
I am not a mining engineer and I of necessity deferred to the advice and expertise of these qualified professionals who were engaged to design construct and manage the facility.
Meanwhile up in the Rocky Mountains winter is closing in on Hayes Griswold and his team.
If they fail in their efforts to deal with the huge heap of contaminated ore the spring will spread Summitville s legacy into the valleys and fields below.

6m capital investment in a staggeringly short seven months.
Yanacocha is a joint venture between Newmont the Peruvian mining group Buenaventura and Mine Or of France a subsidiary of BRGM.
The World Bank s International Finance Corporation came in at a late stage to take up 5 per cent of the shareholding.
Nowhere in the world have we seen ore like this says Mr Len Harris Newmont s general manager in Peru.
And nowhere else have we received more co operation from a government.
The disseminated low grade deposit some 45km from the Andean town of Cajamarca has been documented for well over a century.
The original claim was staked by Cedimin a company formed by BRGM and Buenaventura.
Newmont entered into an exploration agreement with Cedimin in 1984 and has directed operations ever since.
What has finally made exploitation of the Yanacocha deposit feasible is the development of leaching techniques during the past decade.
Newmont now the largest gold producer in the US pioneered the process.
Yanacocha is one of Peru s earliest experiences of the technique already widely used in neighbouring Chile.
After a little blasting it can be scooped up by loaders and trucked straight to the leach pads.
No crushing is required which reduces costs considerably.
It was always obvious that technically this was a marvellous deposit says Mr Harris.
Security has been Newmont s prime concern but it s just another risk in a risky business and you resolve it by getting good people to protect you.
Now in and around the site a contract company provides probably the tightest security ever seen in Peruvian mining.
The ratio of guards to workers is almost one to one.
Transport and air freight of the end product dore bullion ingots containing 60 per cent gold and 40 per cent silver is handled by Johnson Matthey the UK based refiner which is purchasing all Yanacocha s present output.
Newmont officials say output from the three mines in the Carachugo deposit where work is at present concentrated should top 250 000 troy ounces next year.
That would almost double Peru s official gold output level according to Mr Daniel Hokama the mines minister.
Another deposit in the same concession area as Carachugo known as Maqui Maqui looks to be a bigger and higher grade orebody says Mr Harris.
Feasibility studies are now being completed by Kilborn of Canada and it is hoped that the Newmont board will give the go ahead this month.
7m tonnes giving the deposit a life of between five and six years.
Maqui Maqui could bump up total output from the Yanacocha concession to well in excess of 6m tonnes say Newmont officials.
And there are still more promising anomalies within the 25 000 hectare concession site.
Local groups have expressed fears of environmental damage from a possible escape of the cyanide solution used to leach the ore.
Newmont officials say however that they are applying the same stringent precautions in Peru as we would in the state of Nevada.
All pipes carrying the cyanide solution from leach pads to plant run through plastic coated channels.
a large pond has been built to catch overflow in case of exceptionally heavy rainfall.
and Dollars 250 000 has been spent on the Canadian Inco process to neutralise the cyanide solution to drinking water standards if it ever became necessary to discharge the solution.
Miners bitten by the gold bug How Ashanti is using bacteria to release the precious metal at its processing plant.
Gold miners like to think that their latest allies Thiobacillus ferro oxidans spend their lives eating and breeding.
They speak affectionately of them as gold bugs which munch their way through ore to release precious metal that would otherwise be very difficult to liberate.
If bugs are treated well their number multiplies rapidly.
That is certainly the way that many of those responsible for the world s biggest biological gold processing venture talk about T.
Their venture a Dollars 105m (Pounds 71m) plant at Ashanti Goldfields in Ghana starts up well ahead of schedule this week instead of March as originally planned.
The plant is a crucial element in a Dollars 305m three year expansion scheme that will take Ashanti s annual gold output above 1m troy ounces and place it among the world s top 10 producers.
These bacteria are among the most odd of this planet s life forms.
They require a very acid environment and a temperature of between 30 C and 40 C to do their best work.
They cause enzyme and chemical changes on the gold bearing sulphide rock extracting electrons or energy from the ore and breaking the sulphide bonds.
Every few hours each single cell bacterium splits in two and that leads to the rapid multiplication.
ferro oxidans cannot cause disease because it can only develop on inorganic matter.
Those bacteria being employed by Ashanti started life in South Africa at the Fairview gold mine.
It was at Fairview that Gencor the South African mining group built the first commercial scale gold processing plant to use biological leaching.
technology that is also being used at the Sao Bento gold mine in Brazil and at the Harbour Lights and Wiluna mines in Western Australia.
Until the mid 1980s miners used two other methods to break down (or oxidise) refractory (or difficult) ore that otherwise would have released very little of its gold.
Both are expensive and roasting has the added drawback of sending liberated sulphur and arsenic compounds up the chimney.
If the compunds are not captured they produce acid rain and poison the countryside.
Neither of these high tech processes seem in any great danger from bioleaching however.
Two large gold projects where bioleaching would work well at Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea and Kanowna Belle in Western Australia have decided to used pressure oxidation and roasting respectively.
Ashanti considered roasting its refractory ore but opted for bioleaching because operating costs should be lower and it is the world s most environmentally friendly way of extracting gold from ore says John Clarke Ashanti s consulting metallurgist.
Roasting also needs high tech process plant temperatures of 680 C 700 C are required and is not really suitable in a country where there are shortages of the skills needed to operate and provide technical support for such equipment.
In contrast the bioleaching process is relatively simple to operate.
Constancy is the key to successful bioleaching says Clarke.
Always let the bugs acclimatise to their new environment.
Ashanti s plant was built by Minproc the Australian group.
Sulphide ore is crushed into a powder which is mixed with water in tanks into which the bacteria are introduced.
After the bugs have done their work they take about four days and release more than 90 per cent of the gold the solution is moved to conventional carbon in leach tanks where gold is recovered.
The solution containing the free arsenic sulphur and iron is pumped into neutralisation tanks.
Limestone and lime 150 000 200 000 tonnes a day accounting for half the operating costs is added to the solution which is rendered non toxic as it hardens to form stable arsenic and sulphur compounds.
Ashanti s plant has six times the capacity of the biggest built so far but each tank is only twice the size of those at Sao Bento and Wiluna.
Clarke suggests it is unlikely that bigger tanks will be used elsewhere because of the need to keep supplying T.
Initially the bugs will be responsible for producing about half Ashanti s gold and in a year or so nearly all of it.
The question being asked elsewhere in the gold mining industry is.
Newmont Mining biggest of the US gold miners believes tanks are not necessary.
Newmont has built a 20 000 tonne heap of refractory ore at its operations on the Carlin Trend in the Nevada desert and introduced T.
The company has already established that the system works technically and has patented some aspects (such as the way the fluid containing the bugs can be percolated through a large heap of ore and not allowed to get too hot or too cold).
Newmont is about to begin a feasibility study to look at capital and operating costs to make sure that its process is commercially viable.
Once the bacteria have done their work the heap must be washed and neutralised and then the gold extracted by conventional heap leaching by which a weak cyanide solution is trickled through the ore to capture the metal.
Newmont is also experimenting with a chemical other than cyanide though it will not say which.
Gold rush Matthew Curtin reports on advances in mining which may transform productivity.
Technology has come to the aid of the volatile South African gold mining industry more than once over the past century.
Today new advances are being sought to transform productivity as companies recover from a crisis which brought many mines to the brink of closure.
Executives are still nervous at memories of the early 1990s when a combination of steadily declining real gold prices double digit inflation and the deteriorating quality of the ore reserves sent the industry into a spiral.
In the event only two big gold mines closed.
South African gold output steadied above 600 tonnes a year from the late 1980s but cost containment and improved productivity meant the mines shed more than 150 000 jobs or nearly a third of their workforce between 1989 and 1993.
Yet successful as this restructuring of the industry has been the mines need technological advances or consistently higher gold prices of at least Dollars 450 an ounce compared with around Dollars 385 today if gold production is not to go into slow but steady decline.
The problem is says Kobus Olivier chief consulting engineer at the Gencor group s gold division that a breakthrough which would transform the mines productivity underground has proved elusive.
However two new techniques are now in sight generating more excitement about the technological possibilities than there has been for years he adds.
diamond wire cutting pioneered by Gencor and Anglo American the country s biggest gold producer.
and the impact ripper an industry research project recently taken over by mining house Gold Fields.
The first simply applies the established method of quarrying granite and other hard stones to underground mining.
A synthetic covered steel cable less than a centimetre thick and studded with industrial diamonds saws through the rockface cutting away the ore in large chunks.
The impact ripper is an hydraulically powered chisel mounted on rails which attacks the rockface with an accuracy that blasting lacks.
Olivier says the potential benefits are huge because either technique could transform the cost structure of the industry and underground productivity.
Diamond wire cutters can operate 24 hours a day require less labour and minimise the amount of waste rock mined.
Diamond wire is expensive the first material Gencor ordered cost R1 000 (Dollars 290) a metre but greater demand would reduce its cost and eliminate much of the need for explosives used for the 900 000 blasts the gold mines make every day.
Ken Dix general manager of Anglo American s Freegold operation which is using diamond wire cutters on a trial basis says the technique would lead to the redesign of underground mining plans and thus save more tunnelling timber and explosive costs and shave 60 per cent off transport costs.
Underground safety would improve too bringing new efficiencies because the narrower stope widths and minimal use of explosives would do less to aggravate the rock pressure underground.
Rockfalls kill about 270 workers a year underground on the gold mines.
Len Gibbs consulting engineer at Gold Fields which has a number of machines operating at its Kloof mine says.
The deeper you go the more you need mechanised mining methods and less reliance on manpower.
This has been true since the early days of gold mining.
the geological challenges of extracting the precious metal at deeper and more dangerous levels have forced producers to refine their techniques.
Much gold output now comes from mines sunk to below sea level or more than 3 000 metres underground.
The MacArthur Forrest cyanide process saved the South African gold mining industry when it was introduced in 1890 at the Salisbury mine near the mining camp of Johannesburg.
Existing mercury based techniques adequate for recovering gold from surface ore were no good for treating metallurgically difficult underground material which the mines had to exploit because they had exhausted surface reef outcrops.
Gold recovery rates had fallen to less than 50 per cent but to the surprise of miners at the time the new process quickly achieved recoveries of 85 95 per cent.
Yet impressive as the refinements made over the years have been metallurgical and mechanical mining technology has not changed for decades.
The cyanidisation process has been modified to push recovery grades to more than 99 per cent allowing the retreatment of millions of tonnes of low grade waste material in recent years but leaving little room for improvement.
The labour intensive underground production routine of drilling holes in the rockface filling them with explosives blasting once a day and cleaning up the broken rock before hoisting it to the surface is the same as it was 100 years ago.
South Africa s remaining gold reserves are huge well defined but deep.
Exploration has identified extensive high grade ore reserves in the Potchefstroom Gap an area south west of Johannesburg but at depths of up to 5 000 metres below surface.
The capital cost of a sinking a new mine shaft to that depth would be more than R2.
Despite the excitement about the new methods there have been teething problems.
Gencor gave up its experiment with diamond wire cutting last year.
Olivier says the group knows it works but found the wire tended to get pinched as the rockface closed once it had been cut.
Gencor seems happy to wait and see what progress Anglo can make given that the group s mining equipment and industrial diamond businesses have a keen interest in the technology s success.
Dix points to the excessive wear and tear on expensive equipment but stresses that it s early days.
Gold Fields has found that the first orebody on which it tried the impact ripper proved more susceptible to the technique than the orebody at Kloof where the equipment would most likely be used.
However Olivier says the problems are unlikely to be insurmountable.
He adds that while one technique might not transform gold mining a combination of the new technologies with further refinements still promises the breakthrough for which the miners are yearning.
A glittering future for Turkey The way is open for a gold mining industry.
The way is clear for a gold mining industry to develop in Turkey according to Mr Norman Hardie vice president of projects and corporate development for Metall Mining Corporation of Canada.
Hardie suggests that in five years Turkey might well have five gold mines producing 12 to 15 tonnes of the precious metal between them.
Development of the industry can go ahead now that final approval has been given by the environment ministry for a gold mine Turkey s first at Ovacik 100km north of Izmir.
Behind the project is Eurogold a joint venture between Metall and Poseidon Gold of Australia.
Eurogold has been battling since 1991 to get various approvals 11 in all and Mr Hardie says other mining companies with promising gold projects in Turkey have been hanging back to see the outcome of Eurogold s pioneering work.
Fierce opposition to the Eurogold project was based on local fears about the use of cyanide to leach out the precious metal a common practice throughout the world.
There was also concern about the impact the mine would have on tourism the deposit is only 12km from the historic city of Bergama.
Mr Hardie said the Ovacik mine would meet and in some cases exceed international standards adopted in the most environmentally conscious countries in the world.
The mine would add interest to tourism in the area by offering tours of the mill.
Eurogold has so far spent Dollars 15m on the project which is expected to cost another Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m.
Mr Hardie said two banks Barclays and Dresdner have agreed to provide Dollars 31m of project finance.
The mine will have 200 employees and another 1 000 jobs will be indirectly created.
Ovacik a high grade deposit with an average of nearly 10 grams of gold in each tonne of ore is expected to produce about 100 000 troy ounces of gold a year at a full cost of Dollars 250 an ounce.
Present reserves are enough for at least eight years.
Other companies with gold projects in Turkey include Cominco of Canada Gencor of South Africa and the RTZ Corporation of the UK.
Eurogold has also spent Dollars 10m on exploring other parts of Turkey.
Alternative waste treatment Brazil is enthusiastic about plasma based disposal.
A pilot project to dispose of hazardous waste is planned to start at a hospital in the densely populated city of Sao Paulo Brazil using technology developed by Nasa scientists.
Brazilian researchers will use plasma super heated gases at the University of Sao Paulo hospital to provide cheaper and safer disposal to traditional incinerators or landfills.
Hospitals in Sao Paulo South America s largest city with a population of 15m produce 115 tonnes of waste a day which contains blood syringes and body parts.
Because of the risk of disease this waste must be incinerated an expensive process as its humidity content is 40 per cent to 60 per cent.
There are additional health risks from normal gas or oil fired incineration in particular the release of carcinogenic dioxins and toxic ashes.
Roberto Szente head of plasma research at the Sao Paulo state funded Technology Research Institute says.
Because gas is a relatively poor conductor the plasma can heat up to 10 000 C The technology was developed by Nasa the US space agency to simulate the heating experienced by rockets re entering the atmosphere.
Plasma forms at extremely high temperatures when atoms of gas split into a mixture of positive ions and electrons.
It can be made by transferring energy from an electric arc to a gas such as air or nitrogen.
It is only with the growth in environmental awareness that the IPT along with other research centres around the world started applying it to hazardous waste.
With plasma the temperature is so high that everything including metals melts and becomes a liquid pool says Szente.
This pool solidifies as slabs of residues basically blocks of glass and iron that can be used in construction or disposed of in landfill.
Because the result is a molten state which later solidifies there is less risk of dioxins being dispersed than with ashes.
Erasmo Tolosa hospital superintendent says the city council contracts out collection and treatment of waste.
We don t have a great deal of confidence in the current system and we know that in some parts of Brazil the waste is just dumped he says referring to news reports of human limbs being found on rubbish dumps in the poor north east of Brazil.
The IPT is applying plasma technology to another pilot project to deal with the galvanised waste produced by companies in the metal coating industry a spin off from Sao Paulo s booming car industry.
Companies used to discharge the liquid residues from galvanisation straight into the Tiete River one of the most polluted in the world.
But with the introduction of pollution controls to clean the river the companies are left with a mud the by product of galvanisation containing heavy metals such as iron silica calcium and zinc as well as cyanide.
IPT tests show that when plasma is applied to the mud it destroys the cyanide and the end result is non toxic slabs of metal 96 per cent iron says Szente.
Marco Antonio Barbieri director of a chrome company and spokesman for around 100 small galvanisation companies involved in the project says plasma treatment is likely to cost Dollars 40 Dollars 70 a tonne compared with about Dollars 200 for landfill Dollars 400 Dollars 800 for cement kilns and Dollars 1 500 for use of private incinerators.
Despite all its apparent advantages plasma s progress so far in waste disposal has been piecemeal.
Szente says this is partly because it is still a relatively unknown technology and also because companies are unwilling to decommission expensive incinerators to spend more money building plasma units.
