PANEL TO CONSIDER AMBITIOUS PLAN FOR NETWORK OF HIGH SPEED TRAINS.
An ambitious long term plan to develop high speed train routes linking major Southwest cities including Los Angeles Anaheim San Diego San Francisco Phoenix and Las Vegas will be considered by a special two state commission next week.
California Assemblyman Richard Katz (D Sylmar) told a U.
Katz chairman of the California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission said the agency was created by the legislatures of the two states Its efforts reflect increasing interest across the country to build such systems after two decades in which the West Germans French and Japanese have moved ahead in a technology that was introduced by two American scientists in 1971.
Katz appeared before the surface transportation subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation.
The panel was soliciting testimony on the role the federal government should play to encourage construction of high speed trains through research and development tax incentives and enforcement of safety standards.
Carmichael administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration touted the potential of advanced rail technologies to ease overcrowded freeways and airports reduce pollution and transport riders between congested urban centers.
Besides the proposed California Nevada system other high speed rail projects are in progress in Florida Ohio and Texas.
Private investors could begin construction in Florida next year of a 600 million 17 mile West German magnetic levitation rail link between Orlando Airport and Walt Disney World Carmichael told the subcommittee.
Katz predicted that construction on the California to Las Vegas line will begin in 1993 and be completed in 1998.
The 4 billion "gambler s special" will connect Las Vegas to a Southern California terminus either Anaheim in Orange County or Sylmar or Mission Hills in the northeast San Fernando Valley.
The Valley route would include Palmdale Air Terminal in the Antelope Valley.
the Anaheim route could also include separate commuter service through San Bernardino County.
The 16 member commission is expected to announce its decision on a route on Oct.
A consultant s report released last week gave Anaheim a strong advantage based on projected ridership.
At the same session the commission will be presented with the non binding proposal to develop additional high speed lines linking 10 population centers throughout California with Las Vegas Reno and Phoenix.
The system plan as well as each leg of the proposed rail lines would have to be approved by the state legislatures.
said commission Executive Director Paul Taylor who drew up the proposal.
The commission decided to take the step even though its mandate is limited to attracting a private entity to develop a high speed train between the Las Vegas area and Southern California Taylor said.
The commission will be dissolved at the end of 1991 unless the two state legislatures extend it.
The long range plan could take as long as 50 years to implement Taylor said.
The commission s adoption of the broader plan might be intended to blunt the dismay of municipalities excluded from the first leg.
The long term plan includes stations in Los Angeles and the Antelope Valley as well as Orange County and the Inland Empire.
The cities of Anaheim Los Angeles and Palmdale have tried to persuade the commission to locate the terminal in their back yards.
The California and Nevada legislatures will have to approve the decision because the train line will be built on the Interstate 15 right of way most of the way to Las Vegas.
Taylor said the long range plan was not an attempt to enhance the credibility of the original train route which was the brainchild of Las Vegas gambling interests seeking to bring in larger numbers of patrons.
PANEL KEEPS LAS VEGAS TO ANAHEIM SUPER SPEED TRAIN ON TRACK.
The bistate commission working to link Las Vegas and Anaheim with a super speed train voted Saturday to proceed with plans to build the 4 billion project.
The California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission voted 16 to 1 to continue the project planning process and to call for proposals to build the 300 m.
Mayor Howard Snider cast the only dissenting vote.
Snider said he feared a super speed train station near his city would add to traffic congestion and pollution in the Orange County area.
He said his vote reflects the fact that his concerns have not been answered by the commission its consultants and Transrapid a West German super speed train developer.
Transrapid appears to be the only company willing to privately build finance and operate the magnetically levitated train said the Ontario mayor.
However Las Vegas City Councilman Arnie Adamsen who chairs the commission disagreed and said Transrapid will not dictate to the commission.
He said other companies interested in building the train can register with the commission between Jan.
24 the registration deadline commissioners set Saturday for companies planning to seek the train franchise.
Adamsen said a French company TGW which has developed a conventional style train that carries passengers at speeds up to 170 m.
However the French company was not represented at Saturday s meeting.
At its October meeting the commission selected Anaheim 27 miles from downtown Los Angeles as the California terminus for the proposed train.
The board also decided to ask the company eventually chosen to build the train to consider running a spur from Victorville to Palmdale.
Los Angeles officials have pushed recently for a station in Palmdale because the city is building a reliever airport in the rapidly growing community located in the northern portion of the San Fernando Valley.
The Anaheim station likely would be built near Anaheim Stadium.
Roth a former Anaheim mayor has suggested a 17.
4 acre site next to the existing Amtrak station and behind the stadium for a high speed train terminal.
The site is now used by county flood control officials and has a county maintenance and repair shop.
When Anaheim was selected as the terminus in October Roth predicted that the rail system would be A consultant hired to study possible routes has estimated that an Anaheim Las Vegas line also stopping in Ontario would draw 6.
By contrast a line between the northern San Fernando Valley and Las Vegas stopping in Palmdale would draw only 2.
The consultant also predicted that while the super train would create between 24 000 and 53 000 jobs up to 47 of them in Southern California auto traffic on the streets near the Anaheim station would jump from 9 700 trips on most days up to 31 000 trips on "peak Sundays.
" However that increase in pollution could be offset a commuters using the super train instead of their cars to travel between the cities.
Las Vegas officials estimate that about 60 of the city s visitors come from Southern California.
LEVITATED COMMUTER LINE PROPOSED FOR SOUTHLAND.
A Japanese firm told state legislators Friday that it is willing to pay for a 30 million per mile magnetically levitated commuter rail line linking downtown Los Angeles Orange County and the San Fernando Valley in exchange for rights of way along the freeways and an exclusive operating agreement.
General Manager Eiji Ikeda of the Japanese HSST Corp.
told a joint hearing of the Senate Transportation and Appropriations committees here that a five mile demonstration project on the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange County could operate within 18 months of approval.
He said the sleek aerodynamic trains would resemble a demonstration model used at Expo 86 in Vancouver Canada.
Running along freeway routes it ultimately could move millions of commuters each year to urban centers and both Los Angeles International and John Wayne Airports.
Ikeda acknowledged that though his and other foreign firms have developed magnetically levitated commuter trains none is operating yet except on test tracks or at exhibitions.
State and federal officials reacted cautiously to the proposal expressing doubt the system was economically feasible.
Pressed on whether financing would be available for a full 155.
6 mile loop around Southern California Ikeda said Moreover Ikeda said that fares on a completed Southern California system would be less than what Amtrak currently charges for traveling similar distances such as the 9 one way ticket price between Santa Ana and Los Angeles.
Ikeda said his firm wants to build the five mile demonstration link from Santa Ana to Anaheim to He added that his firm needs assurances from the state that the environmental clearance process would be speeded up but not waived and would need Caltrans donation of rights of way along the Santa Ana Golden State and San Diego freeways.
Where medians are not available Ikeda said the trains could use freeway shoulders and air space above freeway lanes.
It was environmental concerns in large part that doomed a 1981 proposal for a steel wheeled high speed Bullet Train from Los Angeles to San Diego.
The Japanese proposal surprised the two senators in attendance at Friday s hearing Robert Presley (D Riverside) chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Reuben Ayala (D Chino) a committee member.
After joking with Ikeda about how fast he might be able to build a system Presley said.
After the hearing Presley supported the concept of a five mile demonstration project and called HSST s technology "far advanced.
" He cautioned that the firm s request for speedy environmental clearances would be difficult to grant though he noted such provisions have been made for construction of state prisons.
said Caltrans Assistant Director Warren Weber.
Ron Scolaro Amtrak s chief administrator for government affairs said he did not fully understand Ikeda s presentation but found it "interesting.
currently is bidding against other companies including a German firm for a 100 million five mile commuter rail project in Las Vegas.
However Ikeda said he sees his firm competing with others for construction of a six city monorail system that has been proposed for central Orange County.
A Japanese firm told state legislators Friday that it is willing to pay for a 30 million per mile magnetically levitated commuter rail line connecting downtown Los Angeles Orange County and the San Fernando Valley in exchange for rights of way along freeway medians and an exclusive operating agreement.
Eiji Ikeda general manager of HSST Corp.

Ikeda said the sleek aerodynamic train would resemble a demonstration model used at Expo 86 in Vancouver B.
Canada and could move millions of commuters each year to urban centers and both Los Angeles International and John Wayne airports at speeds ranging from 60 to 200 m.
Pressed on whether financing would be available for a full 155.
6 mile loop around Southern California Ikeda said Reaction to Ikeda s proposal by state and federal officials ranged from skepticism to cautious enthusiasm.
Ikeda acknowledged that although his and other foreign firms have developed magnetically levitated commuter trains which ride above a rail guideway by electromagnetic force none is operating yet except on test tracks or at exhibitions.
Ikeda said that fares on a completed Southern California system would be less than what Amtrak charges for traveling similar distances such as the 9 one way ticket price between Santa Ana and Los Angeles.
Ikeda said his firm wants to build the five mile demonstration link in Orange County to He added that his firm needs assurances from the state that the environmental clearance process would be speeded up (but not waived).

said Caltrans assistant director Warren Weber.
Ron Scolaro Amtrak s chief administrator for government affairs said he did not fully understand Ikeda s presentation but found it "interesting.
Amtrak and a new commuter rail service Scolaro said adding HSST Corp.
is bidding against other companies including a German firm for a 100 million five mile commuter rail project in Las Vegas.
Ikeda said his company is not seeking the contract for the 4 billion Las Vegas Anaheim high speed train project because costs are expected to be higher than those projected by the California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission a bi state agency that is overseeing the privately funded effort.
However Ikeda said he sees his firm competing with others for construction of a six city monorail system that has been proposed for central Orange County.
He revealed that he recently met with Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H.
Principal business is building magnetically levitated trains vehicles that hover above their tracks on a cushion of electromagnetic force at speeds of between 60 and 200 m.
An offshoot of Japan Airlines which began studying "mag lev" trains in 1974 as an alternative to airliners.
Financed by a group of more than a dozen Japanese companies including Seibu Railway Co.
Was selected by the Wall Street Journal as one of the companies of the 1990s and beyond that will lead advances in technology.
Current projects include a bid to build a five mile "mag lev" system in Las Vegas.
Racing through the verdant French countryside toward Rennes Saturday Orange County Supervisor Don R.
Roth got to fulfill a fantasy announcing the blistering speed of 186 m.
to several hundred passengers aboard France s TGV the high speed Train a Grande Vitesse.
The French National Railroad which wants to build and operate a similar rail line between Las Vegas and Anaheim had found a way to top its competition the West Germans.
It let Roth sit in the cab next to the engineer.
And Roth is a key person to impress because he is the vice chairman of the California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission the panel that hopes to make a final decision later this year about which kind of train to pick.
Roth and eight other members of the 16 person commission rode the French train in shifts Friday and Saturday as part of a 10 day "technology tour" aimed at examining the French and German competitors up close.
On Wednesday they rode West Germany s magnetically levitated high speed train.
The commission is paying 20 000 for members expenses on the tour but spouses and an entourage of 25 Orange County business executives and their spouses have paid their own way.
Saturday s 233 mile jaunt took only two hours and four minutes.
According to the Orange County passengers the experience made Amtrak look like a throwback to the age of steam locomotives.
"It just glides out " said Brian Pearson manager of planning and projects development for the Orange County Transit District.
said Robert Carley senior vice president of Robert Bein Wm.
While the train was proceeding on new tracks designed for high speed service there were lots of oohs and ahs among the American visitors.
But then the train hit a large section of old track and swaying increased dramatically.
"I m getting queasy " said Jim Erickson a lawyer from San Juan Capistrano.
said Aram Keith president of Costa Mesa based Keith Engineering referring to the German train.
The French train s coaches are narrower than those used for the maglev vehicle in Germany but they are much heavier.
said Buck Johns a Newport Beach real estate investor who has purchased land near the proposed Las Vegas Anaheim train route.
That s what French National Railroad officials wanted to hear him say because until then Roth had been leaning strongly toward the maglev.
After a separate trip on Friday commission members Nick Horn of Nevada and Angie Papadakis of California also praised the French train.
But Horn said he was concerned about a briefing that he attended with other commission members during which French railroad officials failed to answer some key questions to his satisfaction.
He raised such issues as the French train s inability to handle steep grades in mountainous terrain financing difficulties and the lack of a specific manufacturing schedule if France wins the competition.
Meanwhile Papadakis praised the French train as "very luxurious" and said it provided a "wonderful" ride.
French officials argue that their train has a proven record of carrying millions of passengers each year at a profit while the West Germans still have their maglev confined to a test track.
They also have statistics showing that their train has reduced the growth in automobile traffic on parallel French highways and has cut in half the number of passengers using airlines along the same corridors thus reducing the need for service at crowded airports.
There are 105 French high speed trains in service on several routes all built on time and on budget according to French officials.
French wine makers continue to object to high speed trains cutting across their fields with some arguing that the trains vibrations harm their vineyards.
French officials have studied the vibration problem and have even tunneled under one vineyard but the farmer involved is still not satisfied officials said.
Also France s activist Green Party which concerns itself with the environment has become more worrisome and bothersome said Claude Constant director of international cooperation for the French National Railroad.
In one case for example the Green Party forced the railroad to relocate a pond to protect frogs.
And the Green Party along with a group of homeowners near St.
Arnoult Enyvelines outside Paris forced officials to construct a concrete sound wall next to the tracks even though they had never objected to a much noisier heavily congested highway closer to their homes.
Constant said French officials say their high speed model is quieter at 270 m.
he said Saturday While the French train ride is more comfortable than that of a conventional train some passengers even Parisians interviewed Saturday said they object to their ears "popping" every time the train goes through a tunnel at high speed.
The problem is that the speeding train compresses the tunnel s air in front of it changing the pressure in the inner ear.
But others said it was no worse than the same popping experienced on an airplane.
said Jean Amburgey a banker whose fiance lives in Rennes about 250 miles from Paris.
Within the Paris area for example about half the commuters use public transit mostly trains including the Paris Metro.
The commuter rail service is so cheap less than 1 per day for unlimited use it is virtually free by American standards.
Said Paris transit spokesman Cyrille de La Faye.
Facts About The TGV The TGV is a high speed train made by the French firm GEM Alsthom.
and has carried more than 100 million passengers since entering service n 1981.
The main TGV line runs between Paris and Lyon.
Pros The TGV has a proven track record in commerical service.
Capital costs are less than West German s experimental magnetic levitation train system.
Cons TGV cannot take steep grades.
It requires extensive earth removal for tracks to be laid.
The steel wheel train which runs on electicity can travel on conventional railroad tracks.
TGV stands for Train a Grande Vitesse or high speed train.
In order to keep the train stable at high rates of speed the traction motors are suspended from the chassis reducing strain on the tracks.
TGV is also equipped with three different brake systems that allow the train to stop at high speeds.
A privately operated high speed train between Anaheim and Las Vegas might quicken the pulses of high rollers.
But if it s done right such a train could also raise hopes for getting some commuters off freeways.
Images of the fleeting French and German countrysides are still fresh in the minds of a delegation of officials and business executives from the county who have just returned from examining France s Train a Grande Vitesse and West Germany s magnetically levitated train.
The California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission hopes to select one of them by October as the model for the 4 billion train that would run along the proposed route.
As it stands public funding pays only for administrative costs related to a bistate commission s work toward setting up the project.
And the law would have to be changed in both states to get public money for this project.
The history of private railroads is filled with examples of the taxpayers bailing out entrepreneurs who could not make it.
So the Legislature should think long and hard before committing funds to any such project especially with all the rest that needs to be done to improve transportation in Orange County.
That s especially so because there are no answers yet to the second big question.
the number of stops between Las Vegas and Anaheim and where they would be located.
That s crucial if there is to be any hope of using the train for commuters.
It s possible and sensible for the bidders to propose something that would provide express runs to Las Vegas but also double tracks near some stations to allow commuter trains to stop.
Of course it s possible that the train will be an entirely private undertaking.
But if either the German or French proposals are to have any broad significance for Orange County they must offer a system to serve a larger ridership than those headed to and from the gambling tables of Nevada.
HIGH SPEED TRAIN NEEDS PUBLIC LAND.
official conceded Wednesday that the company s proposed magnetically levitated 300 m.
train from Anaheim to Las Vegas cannot be financed and built privately as planned without the donation of publicly owned rights of way along Interstate 15 in the California and Nevada deserts.
Addressing more than 100 business executives and engineering experts at a luncheon meeting of the Industrial League of Orange County in Costa Mesa Bechtel Senior Vice President Erv Koenig also said his firm will not do independent ridership feasibility studies a key to obtaining financial backing unless Bechtel is awarded an exclusive franchise from the bistate panel studying the project.
Koenig said Bechtel has already committed more than 3 million of its own money to project preparation and won t spend millions more on additional studies until it knows the money will be recovered.
Until now the only ridership projections have come from a 1989 Canadian Institute of Ground Transport study financed by the city of Las Vegas which originated the high speed train proposal.
The study projected ridership levels exceeding 5 million passengers annually by the year 2000.
Although some experts have strong doubts about the study s estimates Koenig said he believes they are too conservative.
Referring to the cost of rights of way Koenig said after the luncheon that California Nevada and federal officials are anxious to donate a 50 foot wide swath of land adjacent to Interstate 15 but that they must await congressional action since current law forbids private use of federal highway land.
San Francisco based Bechtel is one of three firms expected to file formal bids for the project by the July 16 deadline with the California Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Commission created two years ago to plan and award an exclusive franchise.
The final award expected in September must be ratified by the legislatures of both states.
The other two firms are Montreal based Bombardier and Boise based Morrison Knudsen.
Both are expected to propose French high speed train technology which employs steel wheels on steel tracks but at faster speeds than conventional trains.
Bechtel has teamed with the West German Transrapid group which has developed the mag lev train at a test track near Emsland.
A private partnership is considering submitting a bid to build a 280 m.
magnetic levitation train system from Los Angeles International Airport through the San Fernando Valley to Palmdale serving commuters airport bound travelers and gamblers headed to Las Vegas.
The futuristic line which would be built along the San Diego Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways was endorsed Thursday by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.
Bradley press spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor views the proposed line as a The proposal also could save the city s long shot bid to be connected to a proposed Las Vegas to Anaheim magnetic levitation system said Clifton Moore general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Airports.
Moore said adding that he will urge the city Board of Aiport Commissioners to endorse the plan at its meeting Wednesday because it offers long sought relief for congestion at Los Angeles International Airport.
But submission of the proposal which faces formidable financial technological and political hurdles is said a top executive at Perini Corp.
based construction firm that heads the consortium studying whether to submit a bid for a 65 mile LAX to Palmdale line.
The plan was developed in response to a state program to encourage private construction of transportation facilities approved by the Legislature last year.
Legislators authorized the state Department of Transportation to select up to four projects in which commercial firms would build and operate highways tunnels bridges or rail lines.
Caltrans which will provide the right of way without charge will own the projects but the firms building them will lease back the facilities for up to 35 years and will keep all tolls or fees.
In January Caltrans selected nine companies and partnerships it deemed qualified to make bids.
The selections included Perini and several other major construction firms.
1 and Caltrans expects to select the top four candidates by Sept.
Henry Cygan Perini s manager of product development said Thursday that the consortium is He said no ridership studies have been completed.
But he said his firm has concluded that These were identified as work bound commuters those headed to LAX or Palmdale Airport and those transferring flights from one airport to another and travelers to and from Las Vegas.
The Las Vegas passengers would transfer in Palmdale to trains on the 41 mile Victor Valley to Palmdale spur off the proposed 265 mile Las Vegas to Anaheim system.
heads a consortium that on Monday proposed building a 5 billion magnetic levitation line between the gambling mecca and Orange County that would largely follow the right of way of Interstate 15.
The proposal is being evaluated by the California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission.
The commission was created by the legislatures in the two states to stimulate construction by a private firm of such a line by offering the right of way without charge.
Los Angeles officials including Bradley expressed disappointment the Bechtel proposal gave a low priority to the Palmdale spur which they view as the key to expanded use of Palmdale Airport.
the Las Vegas Anaheim trip would take little more than an hour Bechtel officials say.
Bechtel envisions using magnetic levitation technology now being tested on a 20 mile track in West Germany.
That technology however has not entered commercial service.
Magnetic levitation systems use a magnetic field to propel trains forward and to elevate them one to four inches above an elevated guideway.
Bechtel officials say a magnetic levitation train at 250 m.
generates less noise than a single automobile at freeway speed.
Perini s Cygan said his firm and partners Daniel Mann Johnson Mendenhall have not decided whether to use German or Japanese magnetic levitation technology but that they.
IN A FIRST GROUPS PITCH PRIVATELY FUNDED ROADS RAIL LINES.
CALTRANS WILL SELECT FOUR OF EIGHT PROPOSALS GRANTING RIGHTS OF WAY BUT LEAVING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE WORK TO THE WINNING COMPANIES.
In the first bids of their kind in California eight private business groups Wednesday submitted proposals to Caltrans for road or rail projects to which the state would contribute only the rights of way and all construction and maintenance would be paid for privately.
The proposals of which Caltrans will select four for franchises next month range from an 80 m.
magnetically powered rail line from Los Angeles International Airport to Palmdale to an array of toll highways in Orange San Diego and other counties.
An aura of secrecy surrounded many details of the proposals after officers of some of the private firms said they had been warned by Caltrans against saying how much their projects would cost or what tolls or fares would eventually be charged the public.
He said Caltrans wanted to be cautious about releasing details of the projects for proprietary reasons affecting the various businesses involved and to avoid public pressure during its selection process.
But he said each firm was free to say what it wanted about its proposal.
In Los Angeles officials of a consortium including the Perini Corp.
the firm of Daniel Mann Johnson Mendenhall and the HSST Corp.
insisted however that Caltrans had told them not to say how much their magnetic levitation rail system would cost or give other specific details.
The result was that when Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and other area officials appeared at a San Fernando Valley news conference to endorse what is the only Los Angeles County project being proposed they had to admit they were supporting it without being told what it would cost how much the fares would be or what freeway disruptions might result from the construction process.
These were the projects proposed Wednesday as described by the various firms under legislation enacted last year to facilitate privatization of road and rail projects to supplement publicly funded freeways and other transportation systems.
The Perini led consortium would build the magnetic rail line using Japanese magnetic levitation technology to Santa Clarita by 1997 and extend later to Palmdale and a possible connection with the proposed Anaheim to Las Vegas high speed magnetic line.
That line however is supposed to use German technology which would necessitate a change of trains in Palmdale.
Intermediate stops in the initial Santa Clarita phase would be at Jefferson Boulevard Wilshire Boulevard Victory Boulevard and Chatsworth Street.
The California Toll Road Development Group composed of Parsons Municipal Services Inc.
two French companies and an Australian company would build a 1.
2 billion 90 mile toll road from Fremont to Vacaville in Northern California.
Citicorp and several other firms would construct extra toll lanes for private vehicular traffic along the Riverside Freeway from the Riverside County line to the Route 55 interchange in Orange County.
would build a toll road in San Diego County from California 54 in southeast San Diego to California 905 close to the Mexican border through a region now being developed.
including Parsons Brinckerhoff Development Group Inc.
GIE Transroute of France and Prudential Bache Capital Funding has a competing proposal for a San Diego toll road but a spokesman for the group would not disclose exactly what route it would follow.
Caltrans indicated it would largely follow the route PrivaCAL wants to use.
The Perot Group Consortium composed of Greiner Engineering Inc.
and seven other companies would extend the 57 Freeway in Orange County in a toll road southwest along the Santa Ana River bed.
Lin International Morrison Knudsen Engineers Kidder Peabody Co.
and GTM International of France would build a two mile 125 million Embarcadero expressway in San Francisco either on the surface or below it to replace the earthquake damaged Embarcadero Freeway which is now closed.
Company officials said that unlike the other proposals theirs would not be a toll road.
Construction costs would be redeemed by selling airspace above the expressway.
and six other companies affiliated would build a toll road from California 126 at the Los Angeles County line running southwest in Ventura County to Tapo Canyon Road with a second phase to carry the project to the 118 Freeway west of the Simi Valley.
Caltrans Director Best said he wants to avoid as much as possible popular agitation for or against the proposals while his agency decides which four to accept.
He said that there would be plenty of time for public discussion later during environmental studies and that all projects would be subject to the later final approval of Caltrans.
Even before Best spoke in a telephone interview Mayor Bradley and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D Sylmar) tried to exert pressure on behalf of the Perini rail proposal through the San Fernando Valley declaring at the news conference that Caltrans should definitely accept the only project proposed from the state s most populous county.
Bradley proclaimed himself a big supporter of so called maglev technology under which a train runs on a cushion of air powered by electromagnetic currents.
He said he had seen it run on test tracks and viewed it as unique.
The original legislation sponsored by Assemblyman William P.
Baker (R Danville) requires Caltrans to select among the four approved projects at least one Northern California and one Southern California proposal.
MAGLEV FIRST PHASE COST PUT AT 1 BILLION.
magnetic levitation rail line from Los Angeles International Airport to Palmdale said Friday that the first phase of the line from the airport to Santa Clarita would cost The estimate from John E.
Chiaverini senior vice president of the Perini Corp.
represented a change from the consortium s refusal earlier to discuss the costs of the project the first phase of which could be completed by 1997.
The proposed "maglev" line must first receive the approval of Caltrans which is scheduled Sept.
14 to choose four of eight transportation projects proposed by private firms.
The projects would receive gifts from the state of right of way but all planning construction and operating costs would be paid with private funds.
The airport to Palmdale line is the only rail project among the eight proposed.
An outside expert had estimated this week that the rail line would cost in the neighborhood of 2 billion.
Chiaverini said the consortium of Perini the HSST Corp.
and the Daniel Mann Johnson Mendenhall firm had not yet developed in its detailed proposal to the state Department of Transportation any estimate of what fares would be along the first phase through the West Side and the San Fernando Valley into the Santa Clarita Valley.
But he said one part of the proposal suggests that some of the capital for the project could come from leasing or selling air space above the trains guideway.
It is expected that the guideway would be built mainly along the San Diego Freeway.
The proposal has won the endorsement of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley whose press secretary Bill Chandler said Friday that the mayor is not worried that fares will be too high.
Any private firm that hopes to make such a service pay for itself will have to keep fares low enough to attract large numbers of people Chandler said.
PLANNERS SEEK PUBLIC FUNDS FOR RAIL LINE.
THE GROUP UNDERESTIMATED RIDERSHIP AND NOW SAYS PRIVATE MONEY WON T BE ENOUGH FOR AN LAX PALMDALE HIGH SPEED TRAIN.
The consortium proposing to build a high speed rail line between Los Angeles International Airport and Palmdale a 1 billion project that was to be privately financed on Monday asked for financial support from Los Angeles County because ridership estimates have been reduced by almost half.
In response to a request from the consortium a panel of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission recommended consideration of public funding for the proposed 69 mile line.
One county official said the potential bill could reach 100 million a year.
The turnabout came after the project s backers reduced ridership projections for the line s first segment the 36 miles from LAX to Santa Clarita from 100 000 riders a day to about 55 000 with a corresponding drop in expected revenues county officials said.
Chiaverini a spokesman for the consortium acknowledged that there had been a reduction in ridership estimates although he could not confirm the precise numbers.
The consortium apparently had earlier overestimated the number of bus riders who might make connections with the train said Linda Bohlinger director of capital planning and programming for the county commission.
The county transportation panel s meeting Monday produced the first public indication that the proposed rail line which would use futuristic magnetic levitation technology to reach speeds up to 100 m.
Its backers are seeking approval for the project under an experimental state privatization program for transit projects.
However consortium and county officials said the project could still go forward with local public funding because the state requires only that no state or federal funds be used.
State officials in mid September are to choose up to four such projects out of eight submitted statewide.
Bohlinger said county officials are willing to consider local funding for the project.
Based on preliminary projections the public s obligation could approach 100 million a year for up to 15 years she said.
Bohlinger said the consortium s own projections showed that public funding for the line could amount to one third to one half of its total operating and construction costs for its first 15 years.
Only at that point she said was the line projected to become self supporting.
The commission s Finance and Programming Committee voted 5 to 0 Monday to explore public funding options including possible contributions from the commission the city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Department of Airports.
The full commission is set to consider the issue Aug.
Chiaverini a San Francisco based senior vice president of the Perini Corp.
the company leading the consortium proposing the train confirmed that lowered ridership projections forced the search for possible public funding.
Chiaverini said the consortium still is reviewing the line s ridership estimates and thus its estimated finances could change.
But he added Bohlinger said one scenario could have the consortium build the line but then have the commission take control upon its opening in 1997.
The commission and other public agencies would pay for the construction and for operating costs not covered by fares and revenue from related development.
The commission itself is already 300 million short of the money it needs for its 10 year 9.
That includes many other projects including Metro Rail.
But Bohlinger said the commission still might be able to arrange public funding for the LAX Palmdale line.
BECHTEL GETS NOD FOR RAIL LINE TO VEGAS.
TRAIN WOULD USE MAGNETIC LEVITATION SYSTEM AND AVERAGE 212 M.
was designated Tuesday as the franchisee to build a privately funded 265 mile high speed magnetic levitation rail line that would carry passengers between Anaheim and Las Vegas at an average speed of 212 m.
The unanimous vote by the California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission is subject to at least a two month negotiation of a formal franchise agreement.
That would be followed by an extensive Bechtel financial feasibility study a lengthy environmental impact review and formal votes by both the California and Nevada legislatures.
Even if everything goes according to plan the line would not be ready until 1997.
It would apparently still be the first long distance "maglev" line in service in the world and perhaps the precursor to a new system of surface transportation with worldwide applications.
In a magnetic levitation system trains riding on a slight cushion of air are propelled along a guideway by electromagnetic forces.
The technology to be used in this system has been developed by Transrapid of West Germany and is being tested on a 20 mile looping German track.
According to specifications released Tuesday by commission Executive Director Paul Taylor the eight car 800 passenger trains envisioned for the Anaheim Las Vegas service would have a design speed of 310 m.
Through urban portions of the route mainly in Orange County the train would go about 180 m.
This works out to a 75 minute nonstop one way trip or a 91 minute trip should the train make three stops.
Proposed alternative routes would pass through Corona Ontario Victor Valley and Barstow or Riverside and Colton in place of Ontario.
It is not expected that the train would make all possible stops in any single run.
According to Taylor this would not be a major problem because of the high number of trains.
Taylor said that on peak days 52 trains would be scheduled and during some hours one train every 15 minutes.
Bechtel has been saying the system would cost 5 billion but Taylor s report indicated that as much as 7.
Possible future spurs are envisioned by Bechtel to Palm Springs Santa Ana and Palmdale.
A separate business group recently proposed a slower 80 m.
maglev service using Japanese technology connecting in Palmdale on to Los Angeles International Airport.
has indicated that it would need a public cash subsidy of up to 100 million a year.
The only government contribution the Bechtel group is asking for is a donation of rights of way generally along the Riverside Freeway and Interstate 15.
The Palmdale Los Angeles Airport line unlike the Anaheim Las Vegas line requires initial approval next month by the California Department of Transportation as part of a separate state program to encourage privately funded road and rail projects.
Caltrans can approve only four of the eight proposals submitted to it.
Taylor sounded a note of caution on the Las Vegas line saying that several consultants retained by the commission viewed the Bechtel proposal as vague in certain areas.
He expressed hope that it would be made much more specific by the time the franchise agreement is completed.
Taylor expressed concern that Bechtel had not described the exact state of present maglev technology and noted that West Germany had not yet certified it for passenger service.
Commission Chairman Arnie Adamsen of Las Vegas responded that he and two other commissioners had traveled to Germany last week and rode the train on an endurance run of 1 1 2 hours at speeds of 220 m.
Backers of the proposed LAX Palmdale rail line were told not to expect much public aid.
LAX PALMDALE MAGNETIC RAIL PLAN STUMBLES WITH CALTRANS.
THE AGENCY NAMES THE PROJECT AS AN ALTERNATE BEHIND TWO ORANGE COUNTY PROPOSALS.
KATZ CALLS THE REJECTION A POUR CONCRETE MENTALITY.
The proposed magnetic levitation rail line from Los Angeles International Airport to Palmdale which had excited dreams of a commuter service connecting the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys to the Los Angeles West Side by 1997 was left in limbo by Caltrans on Friday.
The state transportation agency named the project as an alternate to be selected only if one of two Orange County projects fails.
The agency instead chose highway proposals in Orange and San Diego counties and in Northern California to support under legislation authorizing free rights of way for a total of four private toll roads or railroads.
This left Los Angeles political leaders and transportation officials disappointed and unhappy that the state s largest and most congested metropolitan area had been left without an endorsed project.
They vowed to seek legislation that might authorize Caltrans to support additional projects later.
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D Sylmar) chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee said angrily.
Best said at a Sacramento news conference that one reason the maglev line ranked lower than the projects chosen was that Caltrans had been told operating costs might have to be subsidized by the government.
Therefore he said it was uncertain whether it truly would be a private project.
Chiaverini senior vice president of the Perini Corp.
said however he still hopes Caltrans will eventually decide to support it.
Perini leads the consortium which includes the firm of Daniel Mann Johnson Mendenhall and the HSST Corp.
In a magnetic levitation system trains are propelled by electromagnetic forces on a slight cushion of air.
The lack of friction between the guideway and the train allows high speeds at comparatively low energy expense.
Chiaverini said the Perini consortium will not decide what to do next until it confers with the California Department of Transportation.
Consortium spokesmen have said the first 36 mile stage of the line from the airport to Santa Clarita would cost a little over 1 billion with fares of about 10.
Even so they acknowledged a public operating subsidy might be required for the first 15 years.
Later county officials said they understood the subsidy could run 100 million a year.
Chiaverini said Friday that officials of the consortium had told Caltrans that it should still support the project because all construction costs would be private and public funds subsidize most railway operations anyway.
Meanwhile Linda Bohlinger director of capital planning and programming for the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission said local officials still think she said.
Bohlinger said that the projects chosen must work out franchise agreements with Caltrans by December and there could be problems.
Katz said he understood substantial public opposition exists in Orange County to one of the proposals approved there extension of the Highway 57 freeway in a toll road down the bed of the Santa Ana River toward Newport Beach.
Even if one of the Orange County projects does not fall by the wayside there is always the possibility of persuading the Legislature to act on behalf of the maglev line Bohlinger said.
Katz however expressed concern that Perini may soon decide to drop its proposal.
A spokeswoman for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley Vallee Bunting said Maglev trains are the mode of public transportation for the future and will alleviate the congestion presently plaguing Southern California highways " she said.
RAIL PLAN MAY GET 2ND CHANCE.
COUNTY OFFICIALS ASK CALTRANS TO RECONSIDER A PROPOSED LAX TO PALMDALE LINE THAT HAS BEEN PASSED OVER.
Los Angeles County supervisors and other elected officials on Tuesday called for revival of a proposed magnetic levitation rail line from Los Angeles International Airport to Palmdale that was spurned by Caltrans last month.
The Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a motion urging the state transportation agency to continue studying the 125 m.
line which would be built by a private partnership on freeway shoulders or medians.
In addition Assemblyman Richard Katz (D Sylmar) who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee told a Lancaster civic gathering that the proposed elevated "maglev" line is He also vowed to Caltrans two weeks ago passed over the rail line in favor of four proposed toll highways two in Orange County one in San Diego County and one in Alameda County east of Oakland.
The four winners were among eight projects competing in a new state program that allows privately owned transportation projects on public land.
The LAX to Palmdale line on which trains would be propelled by electromagnetic force on a cushion of air was designated as an alternate to be selected only if one of the highway projects falters.
Recently Supervisor Mike Antonovich and Nikolas Patsaouras a member of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission have suggested that the commission might sponsor the futuristic line.
Patsaouras acknowledged Tuesday that the state controls the needed right of way but said He called it and said he has asked the commission staff to suggest ways for commissioners to sponsor the project.
A report is expected later this month said Patsaouras who also heads the Southern California Rapid Transit District Board of Directors.
The commission in 1980 designated the San Diego Freeway corridor from Sylmar to LAX as a part of the 150 mile rail system it is building with the proceeds of the extra half cent sales tax approved by county voters.
Although the corridor is expected to yield a high ridership all rail construction funds have been committed until at least 2002 planners say adding that it would be at least 15 years before the commission could build a rail line along that route.
Katz has said that if the maglev line does not win inclusion into the Caltrans privatization program by the end of the year he will introduce legislation to permit the medians and shoulders of the San Diego Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways to be used for the line.
But he acknowledged Tuesday that such special legislation might be difficult to get passed and that the easiest route to success is to pressure Caltrans to belatedly designate the line as part of its privatization program.
He again attacked Caltrans for passing over the project which he called In urging supervisors to approve his motion Tuesday Antonovich called the rail line a The maglev line was proposed by a consortium formed by Massachusetts based Perini Corp.
the Los Angeles engineering firm of Daniel Mann Johnson Mendenhall and the HSST Corp.
After construction the partnership would deed the project to the state then lease it back for 35 years.
Starting at LAX the line would travel the median of the San Diego Freeway stopping at the Marina Freeway Wilshire and Victory boulevards and the Simi Valley Freeway.
The line s 31 mile long first phase would end in Santa Clarita and would cost 1.
Rail planners say it would carry about 55 000 passengers daily most of them commuters.
Experts say that after being extended 38 more miles to Palmdale Airport the line would attract airport bound passengers as well as those bound for Las Vegas who could connect at Palmdale to a proposed high speed maglev line connecting the gambling mecca to Southern California.

LAS VEGAS MAGLEV RAIL PLAN ABANDONED.
ORGANIZERS SAY SOUTHLAND PROJECTS COULD BE HIT BY SIMILAR PROBLEMS.
A plan to build a mile long magnetic levitation rail line in downtown Las Vegas to demonstrate the utility of the new technology has been abandoned the victim of unexpectedly high costs and bureaucratic delay.
The demise of what would have been the first maglev line in the Far West comes as uncertainties are being expressed about the feasibility of much larger proposed maglev projects including a Las Vegas to Anaheim high speed line and one between Los Angeles International Airport and Palmdale.
Although the Las Vegas plan was not linked to those its organizers say they encountered many of the problems that could dog the larger efforts.
In a magnetic levitation system trains riding on a slight cushion of air are propelled along a guideway by electromagnetic forces.
on high speed lines but the maximum speed on the short Las Vegas line would have been about 45 m.
In a telephone interview this week from his offices in Pittsburgh John Kapala president of Magnetic Transit of America a subsidiary of AEG Westinghouse International said the decision to break off construction in Las Vegas leaving a few barren columns and a single nearly completed station was made by German entrepreneurs who recently bought into AEG.
Kapala said the cost originally was projected at 56 million.
He would not say what the projected cost was at the end but knowledgeable sources in Las Vegas said it was more than 100 million.
Just as with the proposed maglev projects in California the Las Vegas train was supposed to be funded entirely through the private sector with the government contributing only rights of way.
Recently some private promoters have said that because of the tight economy now is not the best time to solicit investments for largely untried new technologies.
But promoters say fast government approvals are needed to keep costs from soaring because of inflation.
Only two weeks ago at a meeting of the California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission which is charged with the Las Vegas Anaheim high speed train an official of the Bechtel Corp.
the franchisee designated to build that project warned that expedited legislative and other approvals are needed if that line is to secure investors.
Before Bechtel could go ahead approval of the California and Nevada legislatures would be necessary.
The company has been given about a year to study the feasibility of the Las Vegas Anaheim line.
Kapala said that Las Vegas city authorities were as helpful as possible to the would be builders of the one mile line but county officials and the business community on the Las Vegas Strip were less helpful.
A proposed eventual extension of the downtown line down the middle of the strip did not win support.
has proposed a larger local maglev project serving the strip and the McCarran Airport.
Most city officials declined comment on the downtown line.
Tom Graham the city s director of design and development said only.
ANAHEIM LAS VEGAS HIGH SPEED TRAIN LINE FACES DELAY.
The proposed Anaheim Las Vegas high speed magnetic levitation train line will be subject to delays that will put off its completion at least two more years to 1999 it was revealed here this week.
But that was not all the unsettling news delivered at a meeting of the California Nevada Super Speed Train Commission.
which was designated in August as the franchisee to build the project addressed the commission it became clear that many of the line s specifications including routes stops and ridership are far from complete.
Marlow II also revealed that German certification of the maglev technology to be used will not occur until April or May.
Marlow said that German transportation firms involved in testing the maglev train developed by the Trans Rapid International scientific group have been distracted by German reunification and by ambitious plans for a 58 billion modernization of the railroads in the former East Germany.
Consequently they have put off meetings with Bechtel until early next year.
Magnetic levitation uses electromagnetic force to lift trains above a fixed guideway and propel them at speeds up to 300 m.
The technology has been slow in coming on line and there are suggestions that the force levels may raise health concerns.
Although Marlow and other Bechtel officials emphasized their company s dedication to the Anaheim Las Vegas project they said that in addition to the technology many key operational details will not be settled until the end of 1992.
Marlow said that the final route of the proposed line has not been determined.
While the train will stop in Anaheim it may continue to other Southern California points to connect with other transportation systems or to attract investors.
He said the same is true with the site of the Las Vegas terminus.
Clark County supervisors have sought to locate the train station in Las Vegas near McCarran International Airport off the Strip.
But Marlow said it may be better to terminate the route at a downtown station.
Marlow explained that Bechtel is also closely watching plans for a commuter rail network in five Southern California urban counties.
Bechtel plans to commission an independent ridership study that will examine alternative routes and show would be investors that the project is financially feasible.
At the outset of Monday s meetings Marlow alarmed commissioners by telling them that Bechtel did not wish to enter into a final franchise agreement until after the completion of all feasibility studies about two years away.
In the afternoon he yielded to commission objections to the delay saying Bechtel would propose the terms of such an agreement setting forth its obligations by the commission s next meeting Feb.
Several commissioners expressed concern that so many details of the project remain up in the air.
said former Ontario Mayor Howard J.
Arnhym executive vice president of the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce said he was concerned at the message coming out of the meeting which he characterized as one of uncertainty.
Bechtel s manager of corporate communications Rick Laubscher responded that his company feels that when anyone questions the progress of the project Commission Chairman Don Roth an Orange County supervisor who has long been an optimist about the project said the delays Roth said the commission may have to seek further public funds to keep itself going or perhaps solicit private grants from foundations or businesses other than Bechtel.
FT 01 MAY 92 Survey of Building For Asia s Future (7).
IF Japan has a national goal for the 1990s it is to bridge the gap between its First World economy and Third World standard of living by focusing massive investment on a woefully inadequate social infrastructure.
A widely held view that average citizens have not benefited fully from the nation s rising affluence coupled with US pressure to drastically boost domestic demand prompted the government in June 1990 to pledge Y430 000bn in infrastructure spending over the next decade.
That total is equal to slightly more than last year s gross national product and should roughly double from the previous decade the annual growth rate of public investment to 6 7 per cent as it did in the first year of the programme which ended this March.
The government also decided in early April to front load the fiscal 1992 public works budget by spending 70 per cent in the first six months to jump start the sputtering economy.
This alone will not inject new revenues over the full year but a supplemental budget now appears likely.
Thirty per cent of construction activity is public works and 70 per cent private at most general construction and mid sized companies so public spending alone cannot offset private declines says Ms Akemi Toyonaga construction industry analyst for Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan).
Government spending shaped both by need and political considerations will be funneled into three broad areas.
residential infrastructure centering on housing sewers parks and traffic control.
public facilities such as airports harbours railways roads and erosion and flood control systems.
and industry related programmes focusing on waste and environmental management.
expanding average housing floor space over the decade from 89 square metres in 1988 to 95 sq m.
increasing the number of homes connected to sewerage systems to 60 per cent from 40 per cent over the same period.
and enlarging by half the trading vessel harbour space by 1995.
Twenty or 30 years ago big infrastructure projects involved the so called bottleneck programme for industry.
But from now on the main concentration will be on people s living standards says theJapan Development Bank.
The biggest uncertainty affecting the government s initiative is the price of land.
Reflation could mean using far more than the 15 per cent of the Y430 000bn budgeted for real estate purchases and lessen the impact says the bank.
An Economic Planning Agency committee is set to release an infrastructure policy review in May or June in which the most notable feature will be proposed user fees to help cover the enormous expense of the government s many initiatives he predicts.
In general the difference this spending makes is going to be felt on the micro level neighbourhood by neighbourhood and hopefully it will be followed by private investment especially in housing to improve people s immediate quality of life adds Mr Peter Sanborn senior analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
The large projects may attract attention from the media and contractors but in the end they are likely to be far less important to average Japanese.
Among the largest of high profile undertakings are new airports.
Faced with an acute capacity shortage the government is increasing total airport construction spending by nearly 70 per cent in fiscal 1991 95 from the previous five years to Y3 220bn (Dollars 24bn).
The flagship facility is the New Kansai International Airport off the coast of Osaka.
The Y1 430bn island terminal will be the cornerstone of the Kansai region s efforts to draw business to Osaka Kobe and Kyoto and will be Japan s first 24 hour air terminal.
The venture has run into problems including more sinking than expected of the man made island on which the airport sits and it is now set to open in mid 1994 about 15 months behind schedule.
The cost has also risen 40 per cent partly because of expanded terminal capacity says a spokeswoman for Kansai International Airport.
When completed the airport will be connected to the mainland by a road and rail bridge and accommodate nearly double the capacity of the area s current air terminal.
Big airport projects also are planned at several regional capitals while the Narita and Haneda airports serving Tokyo are also being significantly expanded.
Waterfront development is another big initiative area although much of the capital is private.
Along Japan s most congested waterfront the Trans Tokyo Bay Highway is scheduled in 1998 to connect Kawasaki just south west of the capital with Kisarazu on the relatively pristine Boso Peninsula site of the Kazusa Research Park and numerous tourist and resort developments.
The project now well under way involves building bridges tunnels and artificial islands at an estimated cost of Y1 150bn.
Another structure at the mouth of Tokyo Bay and the Akashi Straits Bridge on Seto Island will be the world s two longest suspension bridges.
The Tokyo Bay area is being transformed by numerous other large projects including several on artificial islands.
One of the biggest is the municipal government s Tokyo Teleport recently delayed two years and set to open in 1996 and the Tokyo International Convention Park.
Private consortiums also are developing large commercial and residential ventures in the area.
A new train line loop highway system and road extensions will provide access.
The Nihon Convention Centre (Makuhari Messe) and a monorail are already operating and construction is in progress of scores of related facilities.
In Yokohama the Y2 000bn Minato Mirai 21 project will house Japan s tallest building 75 stories high on reclaimed land.
It will join Yokohama Hall and two already completed museums and numerous private projects.
Japan s quasi public organisations are another source of heavy infrastructure spending.
For example the Japan Railways (JR) group plans to extend its bullet train lines.
The Railway Technical Research Institute a JR affiliate with national and local government support is conducting the more ambitious of Japan s two magnetic levitation (maglev) linear railway development projects.
If successful it will help revolutionise train travel and cut by two thirds the travelling time between Tokyo and Osaka to one hour.
The group is now building a Y340bn 27 mile track in Yamanashi Prefecture 80 miles from Tokyo to test full sized rail cars at speeds of up to 310mph.
Many technological hurdles are yet to be overcome including big advances in energy efficiency and the prevention of suspected health risks linked with exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
Commercialisation is not expected until at well into the next decade at least.
By some estimates the phenomenal cost of building a new line along the congested Tokyo Osaka corridor could delay it indefinitely.
HSST Corporation of Nagoya is separately promoting three schemes including an inter city maglev railway that would cruise at 186mph a commuter version and a downtown people mover.
The group includes Nagoya Railroad and Aichi Prefecture and it hopes full scale testing recently begun will attract national subsidies for a Nagoya commuter line.
Japan s now private telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph Telephone is also planning an aggressive infrastructure enhancement programme in the 1990s.
Combined with the JR it will add some Y25 000bn to infrastructure spending.
In addition the nation s 10 electric power companies will invest trillions of yen to increase generating capacity 16.
2 per cent in the next five years alone.
FT 16 JUL 92 Germany plans Pounds 170bn transport revolution.
THE German government yesterday set aside its money worries and committed itself to a DM493bn (Pounds 170bn) plan to reform and partially privatise the national transport system.
Only weeks after accepting a finance ministry proposal for a clamp on public spending the cabinet agreed to build 2 400km of roads and 2 200km of railway by 2010.
Centrepiece of the reform presented by Mr Gunter Krause transport minister is the privatisation of the railways.
Starting in 1994 the western Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn in the east will be bundled together in a shareholding group Deutsche Bahnen AG (DBAG).
Operations will be split into three independent companies under the DBAG umbrella responsible for passenger traffic freight and track management.
DBAG itself is to be dissolved after five years and its three components left to run their own affairs.
On incorporation the government will take over the railway s debt mountain which is expected to reach DM55bn this year.
However no decisions have yet been made on the financing of the reforms nor the nature and extent of the government s plans for privatisation.
Mr Krause claimed the scheme would have a neutral impact on the federal budget.
Mr Krause said one objective was to switch 10 per cent of road traffic back to the railways.
Although Mr Krause s initiative was widely welcomed the lack of detail on financing drew fire from business and industrial organisations while the road building schemes were attacked by environmentalists as dead end policies.
One potential source of funds is road tolls.
Germany was Europe s leading transit route Mr Krause said and foreign road users should share the costs.
Further cash would come from the sale of railway property.
Five of the new road projects including a tunnel under the Elbe in Hamburg are to be undertaken by private groups.
They will quote for and construct the roads and the government will pay by instalments.
Including stretches in need of rebuilding and widening and 1 000 by passes in eastern Germany the development plan involves 11 600km of concrete and asphalt and a total cost of DM191bn.
Improvements to the railways which include completion of a 3 200km high speed network will cost around DM194bn.
The cabinet also gave provisional blessing to track for the newly developed magnet hovertrain between Hamburg and Berlin and possibly to Bonn Bremen and Cologne.
THREE OF Germany s leading engineering groups Thyssen AEG and Siemens are to join forces to develop and build the whispering arrow magnetic hovertrain.
The companies said they would hold equal shares in a new company Magnetschnellbahn which intended to present a private or part private financing plan to the government in the autumn.
The pact follows a cabinet decision earlier this week to press on with a DM493bn (Dollars 324.
3bn) programme to restructure the national road and rail network which included approval for an initial stretch of elevated track for the 400kmph magnet train between Hamburg and Berlin.
6bn in research and development work over the past 24 years said it would not provide further funds.
The initial stretch of track plus locomotives and rolling stock would cost more than DM8bn according to transport ministry estimates.
The project officially called Transrapid received the technical all clear in January following exhaustive running trials on a test track in north Germany.
Mr Gunther Krause transport minister proposed then that the first line could be built by a consortium including industrial groups banks and Lufthansa the state owned airline.
The new company which must be approved by the supervisory boards of the three groups and the federal cartel office before incorporation will be led by Thyssen which has been most closely involved in development.
Mr Heinz Riesenhuber research minister and a firm champion of the new system said in the longer term the Transrapid service could be extended to link Bremen and Bonn with Hamburg.
While industry prepares its plans for the commercial launch the government is committed to pressing on with legal amendments and changes to the constitution needed before private participation in the rail network can be allowed.
Although the transport ministry believes the first stretch could be in service by the end of the century delays are almost certain.
The project has raised protests from environmentalists and strong local opposition is expected from communities along the proposed route.
ALUMINIUM is the most modern of the leading industrial metals and its fortunes since it first came on the scene just over a century ago have always been linked with technical progress in the manufacturing industries.
But if technology has provided the aluminium makers with a seemingly endless stream of opportunities it has also especially in recent years thrown up a series of strong competitors.
It is in meeting these challenges and in developing ways of extending its uses throughout the manufacturing sector that the future prosperity of the industry is seen to lie.
The latest challenge which is threatening aluminium s share of the lucrative aerospace market has come from so called composites such as carbon epoxy in which carbon fibres are embedded in toughened resins.
These provide a blend of strength and lightness exceeding those of the usual run of aluminium alloys and nowhere is this quality more prized than in the aerospace industry.
As is usual with advances in aerospace materials the new composites have been taken up with the greatest enthusiasm in the defence sector.
They also threaten to eat into aluminium s traditional dominance in the commercial aircraft sector but not as deeply as had been expected.
A year ago the company estimated that composites would account for about 10 per cent of the structural weight of the aircraft chiefly through their use in the vertical and horizontal tails the floor beams of the passenger cabin and the trailing edge flaps.
That would have helped to cut aluminium s contribution to the weight of the airframe to 55 60 per cent compared with 73 75 per cent in the Boeing 757 and 767.
More recent estimates suggest that aluminium will still contribute 67 per cent.
The aluminium producers are not taking even this more modest incursion into their territory lightly however.
New alloys involving titanium and lithium (the lightest of all metals) among others are being developed to achieve improved compression strength and corrosion resistance.
And the industry has come up with its own composites in the form of structural laminates such as Alcoa s Arall which combines aluminium with fibre reinforced epoxy layers to cut weight and improve fatigue life and damage tolerance.
Already Arall is being used in the cargo door of the McDonnel Douglas C 17 military transport.
Another composite Duralcan MMC an aluminium based metal ceramic material developed by Alcan of Canada is expected to have important uses in aerospace motor and energy.
Alcan claims it is lighter and stronger than steel or titanium and can be made more corrosion resistant.
In the electrical industry aluminium tends to be a challenger rather than a mere reactor to challenges.
Alcan of Canada through its Alupower subsidiary claims to be the leader in the field of aluminium based electric power sources.
These systems which offer much reduced volume and weight compared with conventional batteries are making significant inroads into the markets for standby batteries for the telecommunications industry propulsion power for underwater vehicles and range extenders for road vehicles all areas where weight saving is at a premium.
The extended use of electricity for public transport is also providing opportunities for aluminium.
Guide rails for rapid transport systems is one example and higher up the technological ladder comes the construction of guideways for high speed rail lines such as the Maglev (magnetic levitation) system used already at Orlando and Las Vegas in the US.
Such systems are also obvious outlets for light aluminium rail cars.
The motor industry has traditionally used a lot of aluminium but there is always room for progress.
Amax has high hopes for its semi solid forging (SSF) technology in this area.
This uses specially processed aluminium billets for forging at one stroke into high quality car components needing little if any further finishing.
SSF also has possibilities in the aerospace sector says Amax and in the manufacture of domestic appliances.
For most people the kitchen is the place they are likely to come into contact with the greatest variety of aluminium uses in cooking foil food packaging appliances such as refrigerators cookers and food processors and of course in the casing of the now ubiquitous microwave oven.
The inside of the microwave is still widely regarded as a no go area for aluminium however and that is something the producers of aluminium foil and containers are anxious to change.
Early microwaves had glass covered magnetrons which could be damaged by energy waves reflected from metal so the manufacturers warned against its use in them.
Microwave technology has improved since then and the new protected ceramic magnetrons can cope with aluminium providing a few simple rules are followed it is claimed moreover that in tests arcing is extremely rare even if the container is placed hard against the oven s wall.
Mr Nick Kendal managing director of Alcan Ekco Packaging says a growing number of manufacturers have been persuaded by test results that their initial strictures against the use of aluminium in their microwaves are out of date and have included instructions for the use of foil containers in later editions of their manuals.
At its Montreal headquarters Alcan has developed Micromatch an aluminium microwave tray allowing selective heating for the various components of a pre prepared meal even no heating at all for individual components if required.
That sort of advantage could help to overcome prejudice in the convenience food sector and once microwave meals are appearing in aluminium packaging on supermarket shelves the consumers resistance will surely begin to evaporate.
FT 08 DEC 93 Transrapid rail venture set for the green light.
The German government is set to give tentative approval today to the revolutionary Transrapid magnetic hovertrain intended to travel between Hamburg and Berlin at 400km an hour.
New proposals submitted by the private sector consortium backing the project involving Thyssen Siemens and AEG will increase private participation and reduce the public sector risk exposure.
A final decision by the government on its backing for the project will be taken only next year according to Mr Matthias Wissmann transport minister and an enthusiastic supporter.
By then it will have to meet with the approval of Mr Theo Waigel finance minister who has criticised previous proposals as too risky.
The plan to be presented to the cabinet today involves a private arrangement to run the Transrapid operations but public sector financing for the rail line.
The new trains nicknamed the whispering arrow are intended to run every 10 minutes between the two cities and reduce the current 3 1 2 hour journey time to just one hour.
The aim is to begin construction in 1996 and start running test trains by 2003.

The project has widespread backing among politicians as a vital project to confirm Germany s leadership in transport technology.
Government and opposition remain divided however on its economic viability.
Mr Uwe Jens economic spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats yesterday gave the scheme his blessing for its contribution to research and development.
However the party s transport spokesman Mr Klaus Daubertshauser warned that it could be an incalculable financial risk.

A private consortium involving AEG Siemens and Thyssen Industrie the three initial project partners as well as Lufthansa the national airline and the German railways will borrow DM3.
Mr Matthias Wissmann transport minister said the plan would give Germany a clear technological advantage over its international rivals in Japan and the US.
Germany urgently needs economic and technological symbols like the Transrapid.
We cannot allow it to happen as so often in the past that technology developed in Germany is undermined by the doubters in the republic.
Environmental groups have criticised the system as intrusive and far from silent urging the government instead to develop traditional rail technology.
Transport analysts have argued that the passenger forecasts of up to 14.
5m a year eight times the present number travelling by rail between Berlin and Hamburg are grossly optimistic.
Mr Wissmann yesterday dismissed the doubters saying that the project would create 10 000 new jobs.
He insisted that the state was not providing any financial guarantees to the private sector investors.
The maglev train is based on technology originally developed in Germany and granted a patent in 1933.
A new push to make the technology viable has been financed with government grants since 1977.
The trains are intended to run every 10 minutes between the two cities and would be held on a magnetic cushion above the monorail.
It would make less noise than a Volkswagen minibus supporters said.
NEW YORK While the New York City press remains unsure whether last Tuesday s shooting of four young orthodox Jews on Brooklyn Bridge was a ploy by an Arab terrorist to undermine the PLO Israeli peace talks or simply an opportunist s attempt to gain revenge for the Hebron massacre the newspapers have agreed on one thing.
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has earned the city s respect for his skilled handling of the affair.
Within hours of the shooting the mayor and the police department created a sense of control that gave the public a reason to feel confident in their government said an editorial in The New York Times.
Under the headline Giuliani Had Right Stuff Newsday reported that the mayor s calm assured performance in the immediate aftermath of the shooting when it was feared that the attack might trigger unrest between the city s Jewish and Arab populations won widespread praise.
Other papers including The Daily News noted how the praise for Mr Giuliani contrasted with the criticism that was aimed at the failure of his predecessor Mr David Dinkins to react quickly to an outbreak of violence between orthodox Jews and blacks in Brooklyn two years ago.
Mr Giuliani clearly wants to capitalise on all this goodwill for Newsday reported that he is keen to arrange a summit between New York s Jewish and Arab leaders.
While praising the mayor and the police for their quick work in arresting a suspect in the case the city s press has also followed Mr Giuliani s advice not to jump to too many conclusions about what motivated an Arab man to fire on a mini van full of orthodox Jews.
With four Arab New Yorkers having just been convicted of conspiracy in the World Trade Center bombing caution was called for.
If the attack was the act of one mad individual it needs to be divorced from the broader tension between Arabs and Jews.
And if it was a larger political act there is all the more reason to demonstrate as the mayor emphasised that most people in this city of immigrants are not terrorists.
GERMANY The German government s decision last week to press ahead with the Transrapid super fast magnetic levitation train by building a line from Berlin to Hamburg was presented as a technological triumph by its supporters.
Mr Matthias Wissmann the transport minister warned against the familiar doubters in the federal republic who might try to hold it up.
Even Handelsblatt the conservative daily newspaper for the business community is not convinced it will really happen.
It is not just the vociferous environmental lobby which is already whipping up a campaign against the 400 km hour monorail train the newspaper said.
Many of the opponents of the project argue from a high level of expertise not least the transport ministry s own panel of scientific advisers.
Their main objection the newspaper s commentator Eberhard Krummheuer pointed out was over the private sector s financial and operating plans for the Transrapid.
They questioned the traffic forecasts and the likely level of federal finance required.
They warned it could all prove much more expensive for the national exchequer than the present plans imply.
Industry is all for it Handelsblatt admits but mainly because of the lack of export success of the high speed ICE train against the French built TGV.
Yet Transrapid s export prospects remain for the time being no more than wishful thinking.
Moreover any big export contracts as in the case of high speed trains will depend on a very high proportion of local content.
Munich s Suddeutsche Zeitung fears the whole scheme will be a multi billion flop.
The fact is that industry and the politicians are beavering away to prevent the multi billion risks of the project coming out into the open it says.
As for the Frankfurter Rundschau a traditional supporter of the opposition Social Democrats the whole decision is financially indefensible senseless in transportation terms and questionable from the point of view of industry.
Everyone else in Europe is pressing ahead with high speed trains it says.
And Bonn simply has not got the cash in the public kitty to go it alone.
If the doubters in the press are to be believed Mr Wissmann may still be proved wrong and Germany may yet go through years of further debate before it launches the next generation of rail technology.
JAPAN The sport of lambasting the prime minister s character and political judgment in the national press has taken on in a big way in Japan over the past week.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa Japanese prime minister has received a drubbing almost as merciless as that meted out in recent months to his British counterpart for his last minute decision to abort a much publicised cabinet reshuffle and failure to avert US threats of trade sanctions.
The worst insult came from the Asahi Shimbun Japan s second largest newspaper which likened Mr Hosokawa to an unsuccessful sumo wrestler who refuses to accept the rules of the game and keeps climbing back into the ring after he has been defeated.
This is typical of the second generation salaryman the Asahi mysteriously comments.
The prime minister brings up serious matters one after the other and subsequently retracts them in confusion says the Asahi referring to Mr Hosokawa s recent U turn on tax reform.
Mr Hosokawa s personal authority has been diminished as a result of the reshuffle row said the Yomiuri Shimbun Japan s largest daily.
However it cited as a mitigating factor that running a coalition government was understandably difficult given that this was a new experience for Japan.
Mr Hosokawa s problem is that he belongs to the shinjinrui (generation of new human beings ) which gave him high ratings in the opinion polls but a weak sense of policy direction alleged the Mainichi Shimbun.
Some people say that Mr Hosokawa s political ideas and policies are hard to discern wrote Mr Yoshihisa Inoue a Mainichi commentator.
The Japan Times joined in the chorus warning that the weakness of Mr Hosokawa s leadership would jeopardise Japan s ability to resolve its trade dispute with the US.

All aboard the bullet The 160 mph train is coming down the track.
There are few more potent symbols of advanced technology in the 1990s than the high speed train.
The fast rail networks being developed throughout Europe promise a remarkable reversal of the steady decline of train travel which has been under way since the end of the Second World War.
High speed rail services have their origins in the Japanese bullet train or Shinkansen which first went into service between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964.
But it has been in Europe with its scattered centres of population and its crowded transport routes that the idea has taken off.
A growing awareness of the the potential of rail travel prompted the European Commission in 1990 to launch a programme to bring together national initiatives.
Detailed studies are being carried out by a high speed task force while the scope of the programme has recently been extended to include the countries of eastern Europe.
The programme which envisages the creation of a European network of high speed lines by 2010 involves the construction of 5 600 miles of new track the upgrading of a further 9 400 miles of track and the creation of 750 miles of linking tracks.
The new lines are to take trains running at 160 miles per hour and more while the upgraded lines will handle speeds of about 125 mph.
The aim is to make rail an attractive option for business and leisure travel on journeys of between 125 miles and 625 miles.
Even longer journeys would be realistic overnight.
Journey times across Europe would roughly be halved with Brussels to Madrid falling to just over eight hours from nearly 16 1 2 hours.
Brussels to Milan to five hours 15 minutes from 10 hours 20 minutes and Brussels to Berlin to six hours 15 minutes from nine hours.
The benefits of high speed train travel over airplanes and cars are that it delivers passengers into city centres it can handle large volumes of traffic is less polluting than other means of transport and makes more efficient use of energy.
In addition high speed trains boost passenger numbers on connecting slower inter city and suburban lines increasing the financial return to the entire network.
They also make an important contribution to regional and economic policies improving links with peripheral regions.
Choked European airports crowded skies and congested motorways have combined to make fast rail travel a viable alternative for many travellers.
The costs of creating a pan European high speed rail network have been estimated at more than Pounds 60bn though it is thought that it could lead to a quadrupling of passenger mileage travelled.
Passenger growth coupled with improved productivity could lead to the rail companies achieving a 10 per cent rate of return on the project it has been calculated.
It is France where high speed trains have made the biggest impact and where the most comprehensive network has been established although Germany too is creating an ambitious network of high speed services.
The French railways began operating its first high speed trains trains a grande vitesse (TGV) at up to 170 mph between Paris and Lyon in September 1981 halving the journey time to just two hours and doubling the volume of passengers using this route.
The TGV Atlantique followed in 1989 linking Paris with Bordeaux Biarritz Toulouse and Brittany at speeds of up to 185 mph.
The imminent opening of the Channel Tunnel led to the construction of high speed lines north from Paris to Lille and Calais while work is also under way on a section to the east of Paris linking the northern and southern routes.
Germany began developing a high speed network of InterCity Express (ICE) trains in 1988 and now has three routes in service including a link with Berlin.
The ICE trains are built by a consortium headed by Siemens while French high speed technology has been developed by the Anglo French company GEC Alsthom.
Both Spain and Italy are working on ambitious plans to establish high speed networks but both currently run just single lines.
The Spanish AVE high speed train built by GEC Alsthom came into service in 1992 on 270 miles of specially built track between Madrid and Seville.
In Italy the Direttissima service runs between Rome and Florence although plans for a larger network have been stalled for several years.
However a consortium of international banks and the Italian railways is now putting together proposals for a vastly expanded network linking Turin Venice Milan and Naples.
At present no high speed service crosses a national border though this will change once Eurostar trains which are a modified form of TGV start running between London Paris and Brussels.
But it will not be before about 2002 that high speed services will be available on the British side of the tunnel because of delays in beginning work on a high speed line through Kent to London.
The main barrier to cross border links is the varying technologies used by the different national railways.
The Eurostar trains have been designed to take account of three different electricity networks and four signalling systems (including the one in the Channel Tunnel).
Track gauges the distance between the rails are not a problem in most of Europe though Spain Portugal Ireland and Russia differ from the standard gauge.
A problem for Britain is its smaller loading gauge which means continental European locomotives and rolling stock are too broad and high to fit between British station platforms or under many bridges.
Technical harmonisation is one of the biggest tasks of the task force working on the high speed pan European network.
A priority is to create a unified command and control system combining the latest developments in electronics computing telecommunications and avionics to replace the incompatible national systems.
A potentially worrying development for the European task force is the development by Germany of magnetic levitation technology whereby trains run on a magnetic cushion above a monorail.
The German government gave its approval two months ago for the world s first commercial maglev train to run between Berlin and Hamburg at speeds of up to 250 mph.
Maglev technology has yet to prove itself in large scale commercial use but it does raise the prospect of a competing system which cannot be fitted into the continental network.
Elsewhere in the world conventional wheels on rail technology is being used for the development of high speed links.
The South Korean government last month gave the go ahead for the construction of a high speed line between Seoul and the port of Pusan by a consortium headed by GEC Alsthom.
Taiwan has plans for a high speed line between Taipei and the southern city of Kao Hsiung.
In North America meanwhile European manufacturers are attempting to win contracts for high speed lines in Texas and between the cities of eastern Canada.
To date high speed rail links have made their biggest impact in Europe but they clearly have the potential to revolutionise medium distance travel around the world.
Magnetic attraction Swiss plans for an underground rail system will take engineers into unexplored territory.
The Swiss are not known for wild leaps into the frontiers of technology so it came as a surprise last year when the federal government and 80 Swiss companies put up SFr14m (Pounds 6.
8m) to finance a feasibility study for an underground high speed magnetic levitation (maglev) train system.
Called Swissmetro the project initially proposed in the 1970s by a Lausanne engineer proposes the construction of 315km of dual tunnels from Geneva to St Gallen and from Basle to Bellinzona.
The atmospheric pressure in the 5m diameter tunnels would be substantially lowered so that air resistance to the trains movement would be reduced.
The trains 200m long vehicles would then have to be pressurised they are like aeroplanes without wings and tails according to one engineer to support human life.
Theoretically the maglev trains driven by linear motors could reach speeds of 500kmh although the planners foresee a constant speed of about 380kmh.
At that speed the trip from Geneva to Zurich could be reduced to 57 minutes compared with the current three hour train journey.
This sounds appealing not least because the entire infrastructure would be several tens of metres underground minimising environmental impacts.
Swissmetro backers knew there would be no chance of winning approval for additional surface infrastructure on Switzerland s densely populated northern plateau.
By having the trains run within tunnels in a partial vacuum Swissmetro would substantially avoid the problems of air resistance that bedevil all very high speed transport.
In Switzerland these problems would be magnified because of the need to have frequent tunnels due to the mountainous terrain.
The project plan calls for reducing air pressure in the tunnels to between 1 per cent and 10 per cent of normal atmospheric pressure the equivalent of the atmosphere at between 20 000m and 40 000m above the earth.
The consequent reduction in resistance is also expected to bring significant energy savings.
The plan proposes twin tunnels not only to eliminate the risk of head on collisions but also to avoid the air pressure effects pressure change and vibration when trains pass each other in a tunnel.
Maglev trains hover only 20mm above the track so even minor jolting could cause problems.
Maglev technology is fairly well established with Germany and Japan the most active developers.
In March the German government approved construction of the world s first commercial maglev train to run from Berlin to Hamburg in less than one hour.
In Japan a Japan Railways experimental maglev train achieved a speed of 423kmh on a test track in February although plans for a prototype line near Tokyo have been delayed by difficulties in obtaining land.
All projects and experiments so far have been aimed at developing above ground open air systems.
The Swiss project by going completely underground moves into unexplored territory and raises questions in at least three important areas.
Air tightness of a very large tunnel structure.
Swiss scientists say it could be achieved with a steel tube but at a very high price.
They are working on solutions using concrete with various chemical coatings.
Yves Trottet co ordinator of the project at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne says there are no answers to these questions at the moment.
No one has ever attempted a project of this scale with these characteristics.
All these elements also have implications for operational safety including for example how to deal with a loss of pressurisation in the train and how to evacuate a train in an emergency.
The present thinking is that a train must be able to advance to the next station under its own power if necessary.
As part of the feasibility process the scientists in Lausanne and a sister institute in Zurich together with the relevant Swiss industrial companies will be studying these issues as well as those related to maglev over the next three years.
Trottet says computer simulations can provide some answers but physical testing will also be necessary.
Later this year the Lausanne institute intends to build a scale model tunnel for tests.
The preliminary study published last year estimated that the Geneva St Gallen line would cost SFr13.
Feasibility claims were based in part on assumptions of large numbers of people abandoning conventional trains and their cars in favour of Swissmetro.
FT 26 SEP 94 Fast train project approved.
The German parliament has approved the Transrapid magnetic levitation train between Berlin and Hamburg after a long dispute which threatened to scupper the project.
With a maximum speed of 450kph (280mph) the Transrapid will race between the two city centres providing an alternative to air travel according to Thyssen Industrie the company which has developed the system.
3bn) to build the track cities and a private consortium will operate the service.
Total costs are expected to reach DM10bn and the service is expected to open by 2005.
