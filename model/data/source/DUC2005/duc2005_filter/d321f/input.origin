19920203000000000	FT  03 FEB 92 / Ballot box conundrum: The merits of proportional representation. Mr Paddy Ashdown favours it. Mr John Major doesn't. Mr Neil Kinnock is thinking about it - but agreed to it for Scotland and London last week. Every other country in the European Community except France has it. All the emerging democracies in eastern Europe have chosen it. 'It' is proportional representation (PR) as the system for electing political representatives, and the debate on its pros and cons is intensifying in the UK as the election looms. Mr Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have a vested interest in a proportional voting system. As a third party with support spread across the country, the first-past-the-post system serves them ill: the Liberal Democrats and their predecessors have never won more than 23 seats (out of up to 650) in a general election since the second world war, despite gaining up to 26 per cent of the vote. With strict proportionality, they would have been entitled to about 150 seats in 1987, and held the balance of power. However, the growing interest in electoral reform is due not to the Liberal Democrats alone, but to the possibility of a hung parliament after the election. Mr Major has ruled out trading PR in a deal with Mr Ashdown. But Mr Kinnock, whose Labour party last won an election nearly 18 years ago, is already moving towards electoral reform. Last week, Labour agreed to PR for elections to the Scottish Assembly and the Greater London Authority it plans to set up. It is also likely to introduce PR for elections to the European Parliament, where the UK's adherence to first-past-the-post has produced extreme distortion, affecting the overall party balance at Strasbourg. It might not be too difficult for Mr Kinnock to go the whole hog and introduce PR for the House of Commons should Labour require Liberal Democrat votes to oust the Tories in a hung parliament - provided there can be some agreement on which system to adopt. The variety of PR systems has been an obstacle to wider discussion of electoral reform - first-past-the-post at least has the merit of familiarity. The detailed working of Ireland's system of single transferable vote are understood by few, and even sophisticated German voters have difficulty in grasping their additional member system. Yet in reality, there is little complex about the options, which can be reduced to five broad choices (see illustration). The decision about which voting system is to be chosen depends on the weight to be given to five factors: Fairness. The traditional raison d'etre for supporters of PR is that it is fairer - the number of MPs would correspond more closely to the popular vote than under first-past-the-post. The degree of fairness can be measured using the index of proportionality devised by Professor Richard Rose of Strathclyde University. This widely-accepted measure is based on the sum of the differences between each party's share of seats and its share of the vote, divided by two and subtracted from 100. The higher the index, the greater the degree of proportionality. The UK index has fallen from a peak of 97 in 1951 to 80 in the 1987 general election, as the rise in popularity of the Liberal Democrats and their predecessors has failed to be reflected in the Commons. It is now well below the range of 87 to 99 for PR systems used in other countries. However, comparisons between different countries show that some countries which use first-past-the-post do produce proportional results. In the US, for example, first-past-the-post elections to the House of Representatives gave an index of 94 in 1988 - with only two serious parties, there are fewer 'wasted votes'. In Spain and Greece, both of which use list systems, the index of proportionality is less than 90 because voting is based on regions and there are rules to exclude small parties. Whether any PR system is more or less proportional than first-past-the-post, therefore, could depend on the rules of the game and national party systems. Coalition government. The chief argument of opponents of electoral reform is that it militates against 'effective government'. First-past-the-post in the UK usually gives the party with the most votes a majority of seats in the Commons. Under PR, outright parliamentary majorities for a single party are unlikely because smaller parties are encouraged. That means government by coalition, in which legislative programmes are assembled by horse-trading after elections, and where smaller parties can wield undue power by threatening to withdraw their support. The economic performance of different European countries, however, suggests that the identification of effective government with one-party rule is not convincing. Strong economies have flourished in countries such as Germany which have entrenched PR systems, while the UK's lack-lustre performance has been under a series of one-party governments. But the experience of Germany does illustrate one feature of PR which many opponents find hard to swallow: it often gives a pivotal role for centre parties such as the Liberal Democrats in any coalition. Germans joke that they can vote for any government so long as Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher of the liberal Free Democrats is foreign minister. Extremist parties. There is a danger in any system of proportional representation that being fairer to small parties may end up being less fair to larger parties - and to the majority of people who have voted for them. The Israeli list system, for example, provides seats in the Knesset for religious and extremist parties with 1 or 2 per cent of the popular vote. They can force the larger parties to implement policies for which there is no popular support as a condition for coalition. Elsewhere, extreme right-wing parties, such as Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, have achieved parliamentary representation under PR elections which has been denied to their UK equivalents under first-past-the-post. Most PR systems try to exclude small minorities, usually by some form of threshold which excludes parties which fail to win a minimum share of the popular vote. In Germany, the figure is 5 per cent, which has excluded small right-wing parties but allowed the Greens to enter the Bundestag. But such thresholds do mitigate the proportionality of the final result. Accountability to the electorate. One feature of the UK's first-past-the-post system is that there is a one-to-one link between MPs and their constituencies. Most proportional representation systems break this direct link to some degree. The list system does this most radically, by creating regional or even nationwide multi-member constituencies. It also puts more power in the hands of the party leaders who select the candidates for the list. Single transferable vote, the Liberal Democrats' favoured system, also creates multi-member constituencies - typically with three to five members. While this breaks the direct one-to-one link between constituency and MP, it may allow constituents to approach an MP from the party they voted for (assuming that MPs from more than one party are elected). Labour's strong desire to retain a direct constituency accountability for MPs means that the party is most likely to endorse the additional member system used in Germany. Half or more of the MPs are directly elected by constituencies, with the rest being allocated to ensure representation which matches the popular vote. Representation of minorities. The UK parliament does not fairly reflect the composition of British society - less than 7 per cent of MPs are women, and only five are from the black and Asian ethnic minorities. Clearly, this reflects the choice of candidates by parties, and could be changed if parties had the will to insist on it. But some PR systems make it easier to create a more representative legislature. For example, the list system can be used to promote greater representation by women and ethnic minorities simply by ensuring that they appear near the top of the parties' lists. Similarly, women and minority representatives can be used in the topping-up process which makes Germany's additional member system proportional. It would, however, be nave to think that weighing of such issues will determine the character of a reformed electoral system. At the end of the day, inter-party haggling will decide the issue - as it always has.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ELECTORAL SYSTEM - THE MAIN OPTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- First-past-the-post: The candidate with the highest number of votes in a   constituency is elected, even if he/she receives a minority of the   votes cast.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alternative vote: Voters number candidates in order of preference. If no   candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes, the second choices   appearing on the ballot for the candidate with the lowest umber of   votes are re-allocated until one candidate wins a majority of votes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- List system: Voters vote for party lists of candidates in multi-member   constituencies. Seats are divided between the parties in proportion to   the vote gained in the constituency and allocated to candidates from   the top of the list, working down.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Single transferable vote: Multi-member constituencies, with voters   numbering candidates in order of preference. Complex formula elects   candidates receiving more than a set quota of votes. Second and   subsequent preferences on votes in excess of the quota and those with   the lowest numbers of first preferences are redistributed until enough   candidates reach the quota.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional member system: At least half the seats are elected on a   first-past-the-post basis. The rest are allocated to parties on some   sort of list basis, so that the number of representatives reflects the   distribution of the popular vote.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
19920229000000000	FT  29 FEB 92 / Hurd hits at Labour plans for Scotland. MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday led a Tory offensive against opposition proposals for constitutional change in Scotland. He labelled Labour's plan for a devolved parliament as 'disingenuous and devious'. He also attacked the Scottish National party's proposal for an independent Scotland within the EC. His remarks came as serious divisions arose among supporters of a devolved parliament at the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The convention, composed mainly of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians, has been drawing up plans for a Scottish parliament. It proposes gender equality by placing parties under statutory obligation to put up equal numbers of men and women. Mr Christopher Mason was one of several Liberal Democrats, including women, who disagreed with the proposals. He said it was 'a democratic nonsense' that a person who received fewer votes might be elected in place of someone with more votes because of he was the 'wrong' sex. Mr Hurd, speaking at Renfrew near Glasgow, accused Labour of backing a devolved parliament in order to take power in Scotland. He said it was 'patently absurd and unfair' to 'strip the Westminster parliament of the right to legislate on most Scottish matters, but then let Scots MPs determine those same areas of policy for England, Wales and Northern Ireland'. As for the SNP's policy of independence in Europe, it was a fantasy that 'Scotland could slide out of the UK and slide simultaneously into the EC as an equal and independent state'. It would probably have to negotiate entry into the EC, he said. Editorial Comment, Page 6
19920328000000000	FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Few women MPs likely. FEWER THAN one in five of the main political parties' election candidates is a women, according to an Electoral Reform Society analysis carried out after the close of nominations. Although there has been a 250 per cent growth in the number of women candidates since 1979, only 10 per cent of MPs at most in the next parliament are likely to be women, the society says. Electoral reform - with either a single transferable vote and multi-member constituencies, or the German 'additional member' system - would be needed in order to change the imbalance in the sexes in parliament, the society concludes.
19920229000000000	FT  29 FEB 92 / Hurd attacks opposition proposals for Scotland. MR HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday led a Tory offensive against opposition proposals for constitutional change in Scotland, labelling Labour's plan for a devolved parliament as 'disingenuous and devious'. He also attacked the Scottish National party's proposal for an independent Scotland within the EC. His remarks came as serious divisions arose among supporters of a devolved Scottish parliament. In Edinburgh, disagreements emerged over the electoral system for a Scottish parliament at a public meeting of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The convention, composed mainly of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians, has been drawing up a blueprint for a Scottish parliament. The convention proposes that the parliament would have two members for each of the 72 Scottish constituencies elected by the first-past-the-post system. On top of those 144 MPs, between 36 and 50 members would be elected from party lists, bringing the total number of seats won by each party more closely into line with the votes cast. This would make a total of between 180 and 194 MPs. To ensure gender equality, parties would be under statutory obligation to put up equal numbers of men and women. The additional member system would be used to enforce the same principle. Mr Murray Elder, secretary of the Labour party in Scotland, confirmed that Labour accepted the abandonment of the first-past-the-post system to elect a minority of members of the Scottish parliament. However, he said, the total number of MPs being proposed was too big to be workable. Mr Christopher Mason was one of several Liberal Democrats, including a number of women, who disagreed with the proposals for gender equality. He said it was 'a democratic nonsense' that a person who received fewer votes might be elected in place of someone with more votes because of being the 'wrong' sex. Mr Hurd, speaking at Renfrew near Glasgow, accused Labour of backing a devolved parliament in order to take power in Scotland. It also intended to improve its chances of governing the UK by 'retaining arrangements at Westminster incompatible with devolution', he said. It was 'patently absurd and unfair' to 'strip the Westminster parliament of the right to legislate on most Scottish matters, but then let Scots MPs determine those same areas of policy for England, Wales and Northern Ireland'. As for the SNP's policy of independence in Europe, it was a fantasy that 'Scotland could slide out of the UK and slide simultaneously into the EC as an equal and independent state'. It would probably have to negotiate entry into the EC, he said. Editorial comment, Page 6 The Conservatives trail Labour by half a point in a Gallup opinion poll published in today's Daily Telegraph.

19920331000000000	FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Persuading parties to give up seats to women  -Radical changes would be needed to avoid male bias in proposed assemblies. WHEN TORY MP Mrs Teresa Gorman recently put forward a plan to stop the 'mother of parliaments' being composed overwhelmingly of fathers, she was met with derision. Her private member's bill, introduced in January, would have created new, bigger constituencies, each with one male MP and one female MP. But Mrs Gorman's fellow Conservative, Mr Patrick Cormack, said he had never heard 'a more silly proposition' in more than 20 years in the House. Colleagues around him indicated their agreement. Those plans for sex equality at Westminster were still-born, although Labour has pledged that its proposed Scottish parliament and Greater London Authority would have equal numbers of men and women. The changes could be radical. New voting systems would have to ensure sex equality and proportional representation for all parties. As chairman of a Labour working party on electoral reform, Professor Raymond Plant, from Southampton university, has been wrestling with the complexities. His brief includes elections to the European parliament, the proposed elected second chamber and the proposed new assemblies for Scotland, London and the English regions. Labour has already decided on the 'additional member' form of proportional representation for Scotland. The electoral system for London has yet to be agreed, but could be along similar lines. Prof Plant concedes that it will be difficult to combine the commitment to PR with a system that guarantees equal male and female representation. The additional member system could work by giving each elector two votes - one for a constituency member and one for a political party. The constituency MP would be elected on a first-past-the-post basis, as now. Additional members would be drawn from lists provided by the parties and allocated to each party so that its total number of seats is proportionate to its vote. In effect, there would be two types of representative - directly-elected constituency members and party appointees. Labour intends to use the 'additional member' to balance the sexes. PR list systems normally require parties to list candidates in order of preference, so all the top names would have to be female, or male names would have to be skipped - in effect, de-selected - until the required number of women had been appointed. There would be a political row if a government instructed parties to submit women-only lists, so Labour's plan may have to be modified. . A Labour government may have to hope that PR would, of itself, improve women's chances. At the same time, it could exhort other parties to improve their selection policies, and do much itself to improve Labour's practices. If the Liberal Democrats were to wield influence in a hung parliament, the Labour plan would be dead. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, says weighting in favour of women would interfere with the democratic process, and could turn the proposed Scottish parliament into an 'object of ridicule'. Baroness Sally Hamwee, Liberal Democrat leader on the London Planning Advisory Committee, is equally scathing. Quotas have the effect of marginalising women, she argues; an objection she also raises against Labour's proposed ministry for women's affairs.
19920220000000000	FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties battle over women candidates - General election. LABOUR and the Liberal Democrats vied with each other yesterday over which party would field the most women candidates at the general election. Mrs Ray Michie, the only Liberal Democrat woman MP, announced that her party would have 135 female candidates. At least three, apart from herself, are in constituencies the party hopes to win. However, with the main parties realising that the male domination of the Commons is becoming unattractive to voters, Labour responded by releasing a list of 134 female candidates. Party officials hinted strongly that two or three more would be in place before the election. Ms Jo Richardson, shadow minister for women, said Labour would end up fielding most female candidates and was the only party 'that will put more women in the House of Commons - not only on the backbenches but in the cabinet'. The Conservatives have 61 female candidates. Of those, 16 are already MPs, a few of whom are likely to lose their seats. But six others are candidates in seats now held by male Tories and likely to be retained by the party. The Liberal Democrat claims coincided with a Westminster rally of 70 of the party's women candidates addressed by Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. He said the votes of women may determine the outcome of the election. Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats backed child care vouchers, which could be used at private or state nurseries or at workplace creches, to increase employment flexibility. The party's proposals for electoral reform would mean more women in parliament. Liberal Democrat womens' best chances at the election are in Rochdale, where the Liberal Democrat MP is standing down, and the Tory marginals of Richmond and Barnes, and Falmouth and Camborne.
19920326000000000	FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Reading between party battle-lines from left to right - The likely social breakdown of the MPs in the next parliament. THE candidates that the parties are fielding in the constituencies they think they will win reveals much about each party, its values and the interests it represents. Mr Neil Kinnock, troubled in the early 1980s by leftwing activists choosing candidates in their own image, was strong enough by 1987 to change Labour's selection rules. He introduced one member, one vote, mobilising the local membership to neutralise activists. The effect has been to reduce significantly the number of leftwingers getting through the net; no rightwing MPs have been deselected, whereas of 14 MPs dropped between 1981 and 1985 most were from the party's moderate wing. The new process has, however, greatly localised candidate selection, favouring aspirants known to the widened local electorate. Hence the selection of prominent local-government leaders: in the 28 seats where Labour MPs announced their retirement between 1987 and 1992, at least 10 selected local worthies of this sort. Retention in the selection process of 40 per cent of the votes for unions has added to this localising trend, with the unions securing seats for their own, often local, officials. Long gone are the days when Labour could parachute into its safe seats London-based dons, barristers and journalists. The party's heartland is increasingly occupied by non-metropolitan party and union apparatchiks. The pattern in Conservative seats is similar in one respect and different in another. A number of potential Tory MPs are also likely to be drawn from the ranks of full-time politicians and party insiders, but the vast majority of the 60 candidates chosen to replace retiring MPs are London-based professionals. If local Conservative associations have a reputation for autonomy, they still show signs of favouring metropolitan professionals over locals. There are also contrasts between the political characteristics of the new candidates, with Labour moving away from the left but the Conservatives remaining on the right. The great majority of new Labour MPs will be soft-left Kinnockites. In a likely new intake of about 100 MPs (assuming a Commons in which both parties have about 300 seats), fewer than a dozen will have hard-left histories, from which most of them appear to have mellowed. A Kinnockite parliamentary Labour party (PLP) will, however, face a Conservative party reduced in size but not in fervour. In place of MPs defeated in marginal seats - many of whom are staunch Thatcherites - the party will have a significant infusion of new Thatcherite blood in safe seats where MPs have retired. In occupational terms, superficially the parties have long been on convergent paths, to the extent of Labour becoming more 'white-collar'. Conservative MPs have traditionally been drawn from business and professional backgrounds in equal proportions. Labour, on the other hand, had a large minority of manual workers, comprising in 1951 almost two-fifths of the PLP. After the election the proportion is likely to be reduced to about 20 per cent. The proportion of Labour MPs with business backgrounds has always been very low and is set to fall below 5 per cent. In place of these categories is Labour's expanded 'middle-class' base but it is drawn almost exclusively from the public sector, notably teaching and local administration. In contrast the Conservative middle-class MP is a private-sector professional - most typically a lawyer. Additionally, a significantly expanding proportion of Labour's white-collar MPs are party and union officials. In educational terms, while Labour has an increased number of graduate MPs and candidates, the Conservatives have fewer MPs with a public-school-and-Oxbridge pedigree. In 1974 50 per cent of all Conservative MPs were of such an educational  - and, by implication, social - background. After the election, in a Conservative party reduced to 300 seats, the proportion will have fallen to nearer one third. It was said that as Mrs Thatcher rose, so the social status of the party declined. The total of Conservative Etonians is set to fall to an all-time low of 30 MPs (10 per cent of the total compared with 25 per cent in 1951). Some advance has been made in the representation of women. The Conservatives have - surprisingly, given the party's reputation for female activists who will not choose women as candidates - picked women for six safe seats. But with defeats expected for MPs of the last parliament such as Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, the party is unlikely to end up with many more women MPs. Labour has, with the help of mandatory shortlisting of women, put women into a quarter of the 100 key marginals and is likely see its number of women MPs rise from 24 to 40 in a 300-strong PLP. Neither party has done much for aspirants who are black or of Asian origin, even if the Conservatives have selected two for the Tory-held seats of Cheltenham and Brentford and Isleworth. Given the level of prejudice about black candidates, the difficulty for the Conservatives is the lack of Tory-held seats with a significant proportion of black and Asian voters. Labour has far more seats with ethnic-minority electorates, and four of them elected black candidates in 1987. The problem for aspiring black Labour candidates is that most of the remaining seats with high proportions of ethnic-minority voters are already occupied by high-profile white incumbents such as Mr Roy Hattersley, Ms Clare Short and Ms Joan Ruddock. In a party where the women's lobby is well-organised, deselection of one of the few women MPs is unthinkable. Thus one minority serves to hold back another. Labour's teachers and lecturers, local administrators and union officials confirm it as the party of public-sector defence. The growing number of party and union organisers, however, also implies a party of power-seeking professionals and arguably one of pragmatists. The Tories, while retaining a mix of business and the professions, will also include more power-focused party functionaries. Ideologically, with an influx of rightwingers, they would be well-prepared for a populist assault on a weak Labour government facing considerable political and economic challenges.

19920428000000000	FT  28 APR 92 / The other Pennsylvania primary: A political race that is capturing the imagination. THERE really is a presidential primary in the fifth largest state of the union today, but you would need sharp eyes and ears to know it. For Pennsylvania has somebody else on its electoral mind and the name is not George Bush, or Bill Clinton or Ross Perot but a 50-year-old woman who has never run for political office before called Lynn Yeakel. Last November the state elected as its senator a previously unregarded Democrat by the name of Mr Harris Wofford, who defeated Mr Richard Thornburgh, the former US attorney-general, two-time governor and presidential intimate. If this November it returns Ms Yeakel at the expense of another senior Republican incumbent, then something quite remarkable will have happened. And the effects will be felt far beyond the boundaries of the state. Interest in Ms Yeakel's fate in the Democratic senate primary election today far outstrips the concurrent presidential contests, which have been mundane affairs with predictable outcomes. President Bush will win all the Republican delegates and Governor Clinton more Democrats than anyone else. Mr Jerry Brown, his only active opponent, seems suddenly to have lost steam. This has left Mr Clinton free to raise his sights against Mr Bush and even Mr Perot, the prospective independent candidate, but it has also meant he has been unable to generate the sort of enthusiasm he will need in the autumn to win back a state which has voted Republican in the last three presidential elections. Anything less than a very easy victory today will reinforce all the aired doubts about his electability. Ms Yeakel had been thinking about getting elected to something for some time but her mind was instantly made up six months ago when she watched Mr Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican senator, grilling Professor Anita Hill in the course of the hearings to confirm Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. So insulted was she by the nature of Mr Specter's attack on Ms Hill's integrity and character that she took it on herself to get him out of office. Ms Yeakel is not without a reputation in the state as the head of Women's Way, a group which promotes women's self-help in education, housing and the social services. But this initially appeared to count for little since her principal opponent in the Democratic primary was Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel, the overwhelming party favourite son to take on Mr Specter. But, on the eve of the primary, she seems to have come from nowhere in a bitter and often vicious campaign to be running level with Mr Singel. She has done this in part by borrowing from the Wofford manual, portraying herself as the outsider versus the insider and placing great emphasis on education, health and welfare problems, of which Pennsylvania has more than its share. But, in a year when women's issues may be a potent political factor, she has done it mostly by playing the women's card. This has already turned up one trump last month in Illinois, when Ms Carol Mosely Braun defeated the incumbent Democratic Senator Alan Dixon as much as anything else on the strength of the opposition of blacks and white women to Mr Dixon's vote to confirm Judge Thomas to the Supreme Court. Working against Ms Yeakel, both against Mr Singel today and, hypothetically, against Mr Specter in November, is the fact that Pennsylvania rarely elects women to state-wide office. Until Mr Wofford's victory last year, it had not sent a Democratic senator to Washington in 30 years. On the other hand, there is a growing national sense that there ought to be more women in the US Senate (there are at present only two, Ms Barbara Mikulski, the Democrat from Maryland, and Ms Nancy Kassebaum, the Republican from Kansas) and in higher office generally. Ms Anne Richards, the current governor of Texas, may even be on Mr Clinton's short-list of vice-presidential candidates. Thus, a Specter-Yeakel race, if it materialises, would be seen as a classic confrontation between an experienced (and male) old hand and a woman with a message. With most primaries for state office still to be held across the country, a Yeakel victory today might well boost the cause of women candidates elsewhere. This prospect engages Pennsylvania far more than anything on the presidential front.
19920411000000000	FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Party professionals come of age in new intake  -A close look at the make-up of the Commons, which will reconvene on April 27. THE NEW intake of MPs provides stark proof that politics has become less a job done by Conservative lawyers or Labour teachers than by political full-timers who have spent their adult lives on their party's payroll. Five are past or present members of Labour's Walworth Road staff: Peter Mandelson (Hartlepool), Jean Corston (Bristol E), Mike Capes (Ilford S), Gordon Prentice (Pendle) and Janet Anderson (Rossendale and Darwen). The same trend appears in the new Conservative intake, with John Wittingdale (Colchester S & Maldon) Judith Chaplin (Newbury) and Hartley Booth (Finchley) all from No. 10 Downing Street; David Faber (Westbury) from Central Office; and David Willetts (Havant) from the Centre for Policy Studies. Such professional politicians are mainly pragmatists anxious to secure and retain office, and thus are important ballast for their leaderships. Union links. A significant proportion (14 per cent) of the new Labour intake has built careers on union payrolls, notably Keith Hill (Streatham), Rachael Squire (Dunfermline W), Angela Eagle (Wallasey), George Mudie (Leeds E), Richard Burden (Birmingham Northfield), John Spellar (Warley W) and Roger Codsiff (Birmingham Small Heath). The new parliamentary Labour party comprises 138 union-sponsored MPs, roughly the same proportion as in the last Commons. This underscoring of Labour's union links implies less a radical reversal of Conservative trade union legislation than a defence of the public sector, in which a large number of the sponsored MPs' unions are active. Richard Burden's union (the local government union Nalgo), for example, took full-page advertisements in newspapers during the campaign to attack Conservative health and education policies. Equally, however, union insiders such as Keith Hill are the sort of ambitious pragmatists whose defence of the public sector (in Mr Hill's case, the railways) will be tempered by a broader view of their party's longer-term interests. Ambitious politicians in marginal Labour seats have an interest in breaking the historic pattern of short periods of Labour rule interrupted by four-term Conservative governments. Local government leaders. The large number of new Labour MPs from local government underlines Labour's involvement in defence of the local authority infrastructure. Many of Labour's new intake are senior local government figures with long experience of running municipal authorities: George Mudie (Leeds E), Jamie Cann (Ipswich), John Gunnell (Leeds S & Morley), Neil Gerrard (Walthamstow), John Heppell (Nottingham E), Clive Betts (Sheffield Attercliffe) and John Austin-Walker (Woolwich). The only equivalents in the new Tory intake are those from 'flagship' Conservative councils: Wandsworth's Sir Paul Beresford (Croydon C) and Bradford's Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar). Political families. The decline of the old-Etonian contingent to 33 MPs (31 Conservatives, two Labour) confirms the demise of the political dynasties, reduced now to the Churchills, Guinnesses (Channons and Lennox-Boyds), Benns, Hoggs, Hurds, and Emma Nicholson's family, which has provided many MPs in an unbroken line since the 1890s. But the continuing importance of family is reflected in the election of Lady Olga Maitland (Sutton & Cheam) and Bernard Jenkin (Colchester N), both children of former MPs, David Faber (Westbury), grandson of Harold Macmillan, and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cirencester & Tewkesbury), whose family has provided five MPs this century. Labour's new intake brings a husband and wife to the Commons - Bridget Prentice (Lewisham E) and Gordon Prentice (Pendle) - to rival the Conservative couples, the Bottomleys and the Wintertons. The election of Helen Jackson (Sheffield Hillsborough) brings to the House the sister of a former MP, Chris Price. Retreads. The new intake includes 16 former MPs, nine Conservative, three Labour and one Liberal Democrat. Conservatives in this bracket are Derek Spencer (Brighton Pavilion), Richard Ottaway (Croydon S), Gerry Malone (Winchester), Michael Ancram (Devizes), Piers Merchant (Beckenham), Warren Hawksley (Halesowen & Stourbridge), Mark Robinson (Somerton & Frome), Iain Sproat (Harwich) and John Horam, whose parliamentary career includes periods as first a Labour and then an SDP MP, and who now sits as Conservative member for Orpington. Labour's retreads are Bryan Davies (Oldham C & Royton), John Spellar (Warley W) and Nick Raynsford (Greenwich). The Liberal Democrats returned Paul Tyler (Cornwall N). Three MEPs - all Labour  - have affirmed their faith in the importance of Westminster over Strasbourg by entering the Commons: Llew Smith (Blaenau Gwent), Geoff Hoon (Ashfield) and George Stevenson (Stoke S). Two other past or present MEPs (Richard Balfe, Labour, and Andrew Pearce, Conservative) failed to make the reverse Channel crossing. Women. The new House contains a record 57 women MPs, up from 44 in the last parliament. Labour, in spite of the failure of half its women candidates to secure election in key marginals, supplies 34 of the new total, including Tessa Jowell (Dulwich), Glenda Jackson (Hampstead & Highgate) and Barbara Roche (Hornsey and Wood Green). Because of the selection of six new women for safe seats - such as Cheryl Gillan (Chesham & Amersham) and Angela Browning (Tiverton) - the Tories have ensured that, in spite of the defeat of women such as Lynda Chalker in marginal seats, the government benches contain 20 women, an increase of three on the last parliament. Elizabeth Lynne's election at Rochdale means the Liberal Democrats have two women MPs. Ethnic minorities. The new House has two new Asian MPs, joining the three black and one Asian MPs (all Labour) elected in 1987. Piara Khabra retained Southall for Labour in spite of the rebel candidacy of the deselected MP Syd Bidwell. Tory attempts to bring black MPs on to their benches succeeded at Brentford & Isleworth, where Nirj Deva retained the seat. But at Cheltenham, the resistance to the imposition of black barrister John Taylor almost certainly eased the way for the Liberal Democrats. Age. In the tough world of contemporary politics, few MPs stay on after 70. Edward Heath (Old Bexley & Sidcup) and his Conservative colleague Sir Trevor Skeet (North Bedfordshire) are the only remaining septuagenarians. Six Labour MPs were born in 1923; the oldest is Andrew Faulds (Warley E). Mr Heath and Mr Tony Benn are the only survivors of the 1950 parliament. The youngest MP remains the re-elected Liberal Democrat, Matthew Taylor (Truro), born 1963. Political trends. How leftwing is the new parliamentary Labour party? No more than a handful of the new MPs are likely to identify with the hard-left Campaign group, which had some 30 members in the last House. Michael Connarty (Falkirk E), John Simpson (Nottingham S) and John Denham (Southampton Itchen) were noted for their hard left attitudes in the early 1980s, but all are said to have mellowed. It remains to be seen whether the frustration of national defeat prompts dissent from the more hardline MPs. The Tories' attempt to focus on MPs who have dropped or concealed their unilateralist credentials savours a little of flogging a dead horse. Nor does Europe carry such divisive potential, with many leftwingers reconciled to the European Commission's social policy. With Mr Kinnock's leadership in the balance, however, it is unclear whether the broad consensus will remain. Many of the new Conservative intake were selected during Mrs Thatcher's reign and reflect its orthodoxies. Men such as Liam Fox and Charles Hendry (High Peak) were teenagers when she won the leadership and came of age politically during her premiership. These 'Thatcher's children' may be expected to carry their political nostrums with them through their parliamentary careers as did the One Nation generation of retiring MPs such as Sir Ian Gilmour and Sir Paul Dean, whose seats they have inherited. Others of the new intake are explicitly identified with Thatcherite positions, notably John Wittingdale (Colchester S), Sir Paul Beresford (Croydon C), Iain Sproat (Harwich) and Warren Hawksley (Halesowen & Stourbridge). A new intake heavily weighted by such people has a potential for embarassing a government with a relatively small majority. The author is a senior lecturer in politics at Aberdeen university.
19920404000000000	FT  04 APR 92 / Election 92: The strategists fail to locate the majority of voters - Women's issues have been given little airing in the campaign. WOMEN constitute the biggest minority in British politics. Indeed, they are actually a majority of the electorate. But whether there is such a thing as 'the women's vote' is another matter. The fact that women voters outnumber men is duly recognised in the main parties' manifestos, yet women's issues have been given little airing. The politicians may dream of capturing the female vote, but their strategists cannot seem to locate it. Surveys suggest that women do think differently about political issues at voting time - and the 'War of Jennifer's Ear' seems to have driven them towards the Liberal Democrats in recent days. However, history shows that the difference does not give any party a clear advantage: psephologically speaking, women's concerns cancel out. There was a small but visible gender gap 20-30 years ago, according to Dr Anthony Heath of Nuffield College, Oxford, co-director of the British Election Survey. 'But I haven't seen much sign of one now.' What was a pronounced bias in favour of the Conservatives has been dwindling since 1974, and disappears altogether if adjustment is made for the biological fact of women's longevity. Dr Heath suggests there may be sub-categories where political choices are more marked: among young, highly- educated women, for example. But he has not detected any macro-effect. When asked by the pollsters to list their priorities, women unfailingly put 'caring' concerns at the top: they want more tax relief for looking after old people, more investment in the health service, more nursery school places or subsidised child care, followed by more part-time job opportunities. These demands would seem to give Labour or Liberal Democrats the edge; yet on the other side of the scale weigh issues such as law and order - the urban woman's fear of attack is hard to overstate - which are natural Tory territory. Perhaps this self-correcting bias in the 'women's vote' explains why party leaders are insouciant about another feature of women's political behaviour before polling day: the large percentage who are 'don't knows'. For example, Gallup's first poll of the campaign for the Daily Telegraph found far more women than men uncommitted on all but three of 45 questions put. Professor Anthony King, of Essex University, has suggested that men feel more bound to express a view. Many men who claim to have opinions may be 'merely showing off'. Mr Heath thinks women may be generally less interested than men in politics. 'Perhaps men only worry about things they cannot control while women are the opposite.' The sex of candidates and ministers makes little difference to the voters, for all the inter-party rivalry about whose gender record is better. A recent NOP poll for The Independent found that 83 per cent of women were indifferent to the sex of their candidates (compared with 90 per cent of men). A smaller majority - 58 per cent of both sexes - said Britain would be no better or worse governed if women had half the seats in the House of Commons and in the cabinet. The toppling of Mrs Margaret Thatcher as Conservative party leader has, however, made more of an impression on women than on men. Broadly, they are happier with Mr John Major. The Tories are making little of the women's vote. They have a spokesperson on women's issues - Mrs Angela Rumbold, junior Home Office minister - but she is not sure there is a women's vote. 'Everybody says that child care is what women want,' she says. 'But for every woman who asks for child care, there is another who may resent the idea.' The Tories think that to offer more than they already have - tax relief on child-minding provided by an employer - would be expensive and of dubious electoral benefit among their older female supporters. Instead, Mrs Rumbold attacks Labour's promise of a statutory minimum wage (which Labour thinks will be especially popular with women) as a threat to the part-time jobs that many working wives depend upon. The Conservatives are trying to convey a positive image while fighting shy of anything that smacks of tokenism. So they have proposed a 'special unit' inside the Department of Employment to monitor women's opportunities, while dismissing Labour's proposed ministry for women as patronising and unworkable. Ms Jo Richardson, who would probably become Labour's first minister for women, agrees that there is 'no such thing as a woman's issue separate from a man's issue.' But she claims the idea of a separate ministry or reserved cabinet seat is popular, even with men, in Labour's private polling and has proved its worth in other countries, such as France, Germany Austria, Jamaica, Zimbabwe and New Zealand. 'We have had 13 years with no women's voice in the cabinet and no real woman's voice: I don't count Mrs Thatcher as a woman's voice,' Ms Richardson says. Labour says it will persuade local authorities to provide nursery schooling for three and four-year-olds, and child minding for mothers who want it. Ms Richardson hopes to steal the Tories' clothes on law and order, too. 'We want to see more policemen on the beat and better street lighting. We are very much going down that road.' The Liberal Democrats' champion is Ms Ray Michie, their sole woman MP, who represents the farmers and fishermen of Argyll and Bute. The party promises child care vouchers worth up to Pounds 75 a week and a bigger say for women at Westminster (and in the proposed Scottish assembly) through proportional representation. But Ms Michie dismisses a women's ministry as 'almost tokenistic'.
19920630000000000	FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour women to flex poll muscle. LABOUR'S women MPs are planning to use their muscle for a collective assault in the forthcoming elections to the shadow cabinet. With their numbers up from 21 in the last parliament to 37 today, the newly energised women's committee believes that careful strategic voting might even double female representation in the parliamentary leadership. There are at present just four women occupants - Mrs Margaret Beckett, Ms Ann Clwyd, Ms Ann Taylor and Ms Jo Richardson - of the 18 shadow cabinet seats elected each year. But at a Commons meeting of the committee last week, an outline plan was agreed to try to secure six or more places when the votes are counted next month. Under Labour's rules - aimed at improving the gender balance - ballot papers for shadow Cabinet positions are only valid when MPs have included at least three votes for women. With 271 Labour MPs, that guarantees 813 votes for women candidates. The plan now being discussed by the group is to create a 'recommended' list of women candidates and to ensure that others who might not normally be expected to win enough votes are given substantial support by their female colleagues. Labour's women MPs were wary of discussing the plan in detail yesterday, and one prominent member of the women's committee insisted it was too early to talk of a formal 'slate' being drawn up. That would suggest specific candidates were being picked out, she said. Instead, women would merely be asked to ensure that they included more than three votes for group members. Beneficiaries might include Ms Harriet Harman, Ms Clare Short, Ms Marjorie Mowlam and Ms Hilary Armstrong.
19920630000000000	FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour women flex poll muscle. LABOUR'S women MPs want to use their new muscle in Westminster for a collective assault in the forthcoming shadow cabinet elections. With their numbers up from 21 in the last parliament to 37 today, some members of the parliamentary women's committee believe strategic voting could double female representation in the leadership. Currently there are just four women occupants of the 18 elected shadow cabinet seats, but several now say that the group could secure six or more places if it voted strategically in next month's ballot. A plan now being discussed informally is to create a recommended list of women candidates. This would aim to ensure that those who might not normally be expected to win enough votes are given substantial support by their female colleagues.
19920724000000000	FT  24 JUL 92 / Smith's new team has younger image. THE SHADOW cabinet assumes a more youthful image after yesterday's election of five new faces to serve under Mr John Smith and his deputy Ms Margaret Beckett on Labour's 18-strong frontbench team. Four of the five newcomers are in their early forties. The changes reflect the meritocratic, as opposed to ideological, nature of Labour's 69 new MPs whose votes played a critical role in the three-month election process. Two of the newcomers - Ms Harriet Harman and Ms Marjorie Mowlam - were women, bringing to five the overall female representation on the body. This is the highest number ever. Ms Harman, MP for Peckham, and Mr Chris Smith, MP for Islington South and Finsbury, also bring an injection of southern blood into a party increasingly identified with Scotland, Wales and the north of England. The other two newcomers, Mr David Blunkett, a former leader of Sheffield council, and Mr Tom Clarke, the Scottish junior health spokesman, will prove popular choices among more traditional Labour supporters. By contrast, the outgoing shadow cabinet members who contested the poll  - Mr Barry Jones and Ms Jo Richardson - are widely identified with an increasingly old-fashioned image of the party. Top of the poll were Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair. Each is expected to be rewarded with a top job, with Mr Brown thought certain to be named shadow chancellor and Mr Blair set to be home affairs spokesman. The full list of shadow cabinet appointments is expected to be published today. Senior portfolios are expected to go to Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary and Mr Smith's campaign manager, and Mr Jack Cunningham, until now campaigns co-ordinator. They are expected to contest the role of shadow foreign affairs spokesman vacated by Mr Gerald Kaufman. Welcoming the appointments yesterday, Mr Smith singled out the success of his cabinet's female members. 'The Labour party now has more women in senior positions than any British political party in history,' he said. Other successful candidates pledged to start working immediately towards ensuring that the party wins the next general election. 'Now we have a new leadership in place, we will be able to roll up our sleeves and get stuck into the government,' said an ebullient Mr Chris Smith. Shadow cabinet line-up, Page 6
19920711000000000	FT  11 JUL 92 / Poland names new premier. POLAND'S five-week government crisis ended yesterday as parliament approved Ms Hanna Suchocka, a 46-year-old lawyer, as prime minister of a seven-party coalition government. Ms Suchocka, who is from the pro-free enterprise Democratic Union (UD) party, won a 233-vote majority in the 460-seat lower house (the Sejm). The coalition which sustains the government is made up of parties which share a common past in the anti-communist Solidarity movement, which fractured after the collapse of communist power in 1989. At its heart is an alliance between the UD, the largest of the ex-Solidarity parties, the pro-free market Liberal Democratic Congress, the right-wing catholic nationalist (ZChN) party and Solidarity farmers' groups. The new government will be opposed by the former Communist party with 60 seats and the right-wing populist Confederation for an Independent Poland with 49 seats. But President Lech Walesa has assented to the new government, which can also count on the votes or benevolent neutrality of several smaller parties in the fractured parliament of 29 parties which emerged from last October's general elections. Ms Suchocka, Poland's first female prime minister, told parliament her government's priorities would be to overcome the crisis in public finances, speed privatisation, raise efficiency in the state sector of the economy and modernise the farming sector. She also presented her coalition cabinet, which parliament is expected to vote on today after the candidates have been vetted by parliamentary committees.
19920710000000000	FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour 'runners' line up. THE starting gun for Labour's shadow cabinet elections was formally fired yesterday amid expectations that a record field of up to 60 candidates for 18 places might let several dark horses through to serve in Mr John Smith's administration. In fact, the race began almost as soon as the new parliament was sworn in, as candidates jostled for support from the 271 Labour MPs, who form what was once dubbed the world's 'most sophisticated electorate'. With Mr Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett now universally expected to win the leadership and deputy leadership, two positions will automatically become vacant. A further space comes from Mr Gerald Kaufman's decision not to run. Many MPs also believe that Ms Jo Richardson, the veteran champion of women's causes, is highly vulnerable, having come bottom in last year's poll with 107 votes. Among those frequently cited as potential winners are Ms Harriet Harman, the party's voice on health, Mr David Blunkett, local government spokesman, and Ms Marjorie Mowlam, voice on City affairs. Campaigners calculate that the larger number of candidates and MPs this year means that between 95 and 105 votes should prove sufficient to guarantee a place. As rules require that at least three votes must be cast for women, there is some speculation that women's representation might rise from the present four places to six or more. Nominations opened yesterday and close next Thursday with the issue of ballot papers. The election itself will be completed, however, only on July 23 - a full five days after the winners of the leadership and deputy leadership are known. Meanwhile, the race for the chairmanship of the parliamentary Labour party looks set to be a photo-finish. In the second round of the exhaustive ballot, Mr Doug Hoyle, widely deemed the anti-establishment candidate, scored 93 votes against 72 for Mr Ernie Ross. Mr Allan Rogers and Mrs Gwyneth Dunwoody have been eliminated, leaving a run-off next week. Another vacancy is in the Lords, where Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos has announced he is stepping down from leadership of the Labour group.
19920918000000000	FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (12): Near the bottom of the world table  -Human Development. PAKISTAN'S economic growth rates, though at times impressive, have not helped to improve the quality of life of many of the country's 117m people. It was the world's fifth fastest growing country during the 1980s. But it came 120th among 160 countries in the UNDP's human development index. Some of the individual indicators for human develop- ment are depressing. The government estimates that: only 34 per cent of adults are literate; public expenditure on education was 2.3 per cent of GNP last year, significantly below the 3.7 per cent average for developing countries; only 40 per cent of children of primary school age are enrolled in schools; 52 per cent of children suffer from malnutrition and only 55 per cent of the population has access to medical care. Conditions for women are worse than for men. This has been a particular source of concern for foreign aid donors and development experts. To counter this, the federal and provincial governments have committed Rs53bn (Pounds 1.15bn) over the next three years to a Social Action Programme to improve the indicators. 'We feel that we need to have an accelerated programme so that lost time can be made up', says Mr Sardar Asseff Ahmed Ali, minister of state for economic affairs. Under the programme's tar- gets, literacy is projected to rise to 50 per cent from the present 34 per cent. In addition, there should be improve- ments in nutrition, primary health care, family planning, rural water supply and sanit- ation. 'This will be the biggest quantum jump in Pakistan's history in the social sector', says Mr Ali. Despite the programme, there is still concern at some of the obstacles in the way of improving social welfare, especially the high population growth. The present 3 per cent growth rate is among the highest in the developing world. In addition, some developmental experts are concerned that initiatives for improving the status of women can only succeed if more women hold public office. At present, there are only two women members (Benazir Bhutto and her mother) in Pak- istan's 217 seat lower house of parliament and one among the 87 upper house legislators. Prime minister Nawaz Sharif's government plans to introduce a special constitutional amendment which will reserve 20 seats for women in the lower house, Mr Ali says. Some developmental experts argue that more women members in the parliament may in turn strengthen the women's rights lobby, putting more pressure on the government to give closer attention to their development. On this and other areas of social programmes, the next three years will be an important test of Pakistan's ability to match its quality of economic growth with the quality of life for its people.
19920812000000000	FT  12 AUG 92 / Management: Madonnas in retreat - Opportunities for women are shrinking fast in cash-strapped Japan. Three years ago, the success of the Iron Butterfly, Miss Takako Doi, the Socialist Party leader, created a 'Madonna Boom' in Japanese politics, with parties rushing to enlist women candidates and the country debating when the first woman prime minister would be appointed. Corporate Japan had its own Madonna Boom, as image-conscious companies commissioned advertisements that portrayed strong women talking on cellular phones or putting in overtime long after the men had left for their karaoke bars and their water-weakened whiskies. In the meantime, Miss Doi has resigned, the number of new women candidates at last month's Upper House fell by half, and cash-strapped Japanese companies have begun a back-to-basics campaign which includes trimming the intake of new women and the opportunities for women already on the career path. Companies are remarkably blunt about their intentions. Toyota Motor will reduce its intake this year of young male high school graduates by 7.4 per cent to 1,580, while the number of women graduates is to fall by 25.6 per cent to 570. Nomura Securities will halve its annual intake of women from last year's 800, and the total number of women workers is likely to fall to 3,000 in 1997 from the present 5,000. There are two career tracks for women in Japan: the 'ippanshoku', which involves general administrative work and carries no promise of promotion; and the 'sogoshoku', which is supposed to provide women with promotion opportunities equal to those of the mainstream men. Women on both tracks are having to pay the price for bad management decisions made in the late 1980s, the easy money era, when firms rapidly expanded their workforces. For example, securities industry personnel increased by 41.6 per cent in the four years until the peaking of the stock market in December 1989. The collapse of the stock market and the economic slowdown have shown that while Japanese women are making incremental gains in the workplace, the impression of equal opportunity was as exaggerated as the Nikkei market average in 1989. At that time, the labour shortage and the need for more women managers were urgent themes in the Japanese financial press, and it seemed women would inevitably take places at the top corporate tables. However, a study by Recruit Research of graduates' job opportunities has shown that not only are opportunities for women severely limited at the top end of management, but that there is a striking imbalance at the entry end, even for graduates of the more prestigious universities. University background is important, as about 45 per cent of the bureaucratic elite come annually from Tokyo and Kyoto universities. Recruit found that the ratio of new job offers to male graduates last year was 2.72:1, but that for the present year, the figure fell to 2.22. For women graduates, including those from two-year specialist courses, the job offer ratio was a meagre 1.30 last year and had declined to 0.93, meaning that there are more applicants than jobs for the first time in eight years. A section manager at one of Japan's Big Four securities houses suggested that women have suffered most because they were hired simply to sell stocks  -and the market collapse had made them redundant. A second role in corporate identity campaigns has also evaporated - companies were once keen to attract publicity by hiring more women, he said, but this image-enhancing drive has been scaled down. For example, securities companies were particularly keen to impress foreign clients, and made a point of dispatching women to their offices in London and New York. A Japanese house had sent four women to its London office, but, to save money, recently cut back to just one. one. Personnel managers generally argue that women are unable to make the commitment necessary to justify the expense of training them for management positions. Without that commitment, there will be no promotion goes the argument, though the research by Recruit suggests there are fewer opportunities regardless of the commitment. Companies are continuing 'experiments' with women managers, in that they are allowed to do what male graduates of the same age would do. In one test case, a 27-year-old woman at a Japanese commercial bank was recently sent from Tokyo head office to a suburban branch to work as a loans officer, enabling her to gather the experience necessary for further promotion. The bank found that some proprietors of smaller businesses were offended when their account was given to a woman, so she has concentrated on less prejudiced proprietors, as well as foreign businesses and the more liberal-minded of the larger Japanese companies. Her work schedule is tough, with 13-hour days the norm, and she fears that somewhere down the career track, the male-dominated system may reject her. But she is determined to succeed: 'The personnel department is always checking on me, ringing the branch manager to ask about my work. But I feel that I have to stay. If I stop, it will be more difficult for other women.'
19921021000000000	FT  21 OCT 92 / Republicans struggle to woo women voters: Contentious issues are being played down. PRESIDENT George Bush, trailing badly in the polls, is faring even worse among women voters. As a result the Republicans have been struggling to recast their appeal to women - or, some say, repair the damage they have already done. Not only do women constitute the majority of the population but they vote in greater numbers - up to 10m more, by some estimates. Mr Bush was at pains in Monday night's final presidential debate to rebut charges that he, along with his presidential rivals, surrounded himself with white men. 'We've a good record of appointing women in high positions and positions of trust and I'm not defensive at all about it.' His running mate, Vice-President Dan Quayle, has also found a new coyness on the divisive issue of abortion, and backed away from the more strident 'family values' rhetoric so much a feature of the Republican convention in August. It was, he said last month, 'a very complex issue' and his concern was 'to get more of a national reflection on the tragedy of abortion'. Even some of Mr Bush's supporters concede that the Democrats have appeared more responsive to women's concerns. Ms Linda DiVall, the Republican pollster, says 'women tend to look to the government to take a more active role in solving the problems in their lives'. She cites issues such as health care, day care, parental leave and the fight against job and pay discrimination as areas where the more interventionist Democratic approach appeals. In many respects women have borne the brunt of current US economic problems, the central focus of the Democratic campaign. Of families headed by single women, 45 per cent live in poverty; nearly two-thirds of workers on the minimum wage are women. A recent survey of women's attitudes showed that the economic security of their families was the overriding concern. It also indicated that financial pressures have pushed more women into the workforce - 57 per cent of the total population - but that working mothers still feel they are mainly responsible for keeping their families together. The early emphasis on 'family values' seemed at times wildly out of touch with these realities. 'I believe the message to working women that came out of the Republican convention was enormously harmful,' said Ms Page Gardner, who handles women's issues for the campaign of Governor Bill Clinton. 'What women want is something that will make it easier for them to juggle work and family.' Mrs Marilyn Quayle, the vice-president's wife, took to the pages of the New York Times to remedy the impression left by her assertion at the convention that 'most women do not want to be liberated from their essential nature as women'. She wrote that, far from attacking working women, she believed that 'making choices concerning work and family has become a constant in women's lives'. It is not only in the context of family values that women's role and status in society have been widely discussed. A series of scandals has drawn attention to the problem of sexual abuse in the armed services. More significantly, last year's confirmation hearings for Judge Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court nominee - and the all-male Senate judiciary committee's aggressive questioning of Prof Anita Hill, who accused him of sexual harassment - continue to cast a long shadow. This spectacle, reinforcing the perception that Washington's institutions are old-fashioned and insensitive, gave impetus to the record number of women running this year for high office. Eleven women (10 Democrats) have been nominated for the Senate, which has now only three women members, of whom one is a temporary stand-in. These include strong Democratic contenders in California, Illinois and Pennsylvania, important battleground states in the presidential election. Analysts believe the female candidates will help draw women into the Democratic camp in these states. Ms Harriet Woods, a women's rights activist, notes that Mr Clinton has made an effort to associate himself publicly with them - both at the Democratic convention and on the campaign stump. The Republicans, in contrast, have tended to use surrogates, such as Ms Lynn Martin, the labour secretary, or the candidates' wives. The question of abortion is a wild card in the election. The Supreme Court recently upheld its guarantee of abortion rights by the narrowest of margins, indicating that another Republican justice could tip the balance against it. Under the influence of the right wing the Republican platform in Houston included a strong anti-abortion position, which still dogs the attempts of Mr Bush and his running mate to play down its significance. Polls show economic issues rating higher than abortion with women voters - but strategists from both parties believe the issue has hidden force. It is clearly a factor for many upper-middle class Republican women, who may be deserting the party in significant numbers. Ms Woods points out that the threat to legalised abortion may reinforce financial concerns. Ms DiVall argues that Mr Bush can regain women's votes, but only if he confronts this concern by redefining the debate over economic opportunities. 'He must make it clear that an activist government is, in fact, the enemy of choice,' she says.
19921016000000000	FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Bush election cruise sails perilously near the rocks - Why lack of strategy helped to undermine the President's re-election battle. TWELVE months ago, it did not appear that President George Bush would need much strategy to win re-election. Riding high in the opinion polls after the military and diplomatic triumphs of the Gulf War, with reasonable predictions of economic recovery for 1992, and with the leading lights of the Democratic Party unwilling to take him on, he could have been excused for anticipating a leisure cruise to a second term. When things first began to go awry - the Senate by-election loss in Pennsylvania last November, the disastrous trip to Japan in January and the general emergence from the warm Gulf hangover - Mr Bush and his advisers still seemed more puzzled than worried. Then along came Mr Pat Buchanan and his right-wing insurgency. Mr Bush seemed torn between a compulsion to compete with Mr Buchanan for President Reagan's right-wing cohorts, who had helped him to victory in 1988, and treating the polemicist with presidential disdain while proclaiming the virtues of the middle ground. Though never a real threat for the Republican nomination, Mr Buchanan succeeded in preventing Mr Bush from staking out any kind of early strategic position beyond proclamation of his experience. In contrast, Governor Bill Clinton's long run always had a consistent strategic purpose. Still pinned to the board in his Little Rock war-room is the slogan 'the economy, stupid' - an admonition to the candidate and his campaign never to swerve from this central issue. From the very beginning, there was a proliferation of position papers on every known social and economic policy subject. Mr Paul Tsongas, with some temporary success, was equally explicit. The second string was an equally clear determination to rid the Democratic Party of its left-wing baggage to make it more acceptable to the white and suburban vote that had gone Republican in droves during the last three elections. This meant not only winning primaries but also handling the traditional party power bases, organised labour and the Rev Jesse Jackson, the black leader, in such a way as to make it clear that the candidate was beholden to neither. Simultaneously, as Mr Bush's team of advisers was increasingly seen bickering - with Mr Sam Skinner making a hash of the pivotal post of White House chief of staff - the Clinton core was toughened and united by the adversity of all the stories about the candidate's private life. Amid the debate over Vice-President Dan Quayle's presence on the Republican ticket, Mr Clinton defied the conventional wisdom by choosing Senator Al Gore, a man of his own age and beliefs and from the same part of the country. Consistency was successfully portrayed as a virtue and the Democratic convention in New York in July was a display case for the candidate's centrism, run with an efficiency once typical of Republicans. Mr Ross Perot streaked across the springtime political sky, potentially upsetting all political calculations. But he disappeared abruptly in July, only to resurface with a month to go. An eye-catching performance in the first debate has reignited interest in his independent candidacy, but almost certainly not to the point that he could win the White House. The sudden surge from last to first by Mr Clinton in July put the Bush campaign very much on the strategic spot, not least because Mr Clinton refused to sit on his new lead. The immensely successful post-convention bus tours of the mid-west and the farm belt preserved momentum at precisely the time four years before that Mr Michael Dukakis took a holiday and squandered his. If New York in July was Mr Clinton's apex, Houston in August was Mr Bush's nadir. Patently needing to reclaim the middle ground, his campaign allowed the far right to dominate the convention with its exclusionary dogma. Mr Bush may actually have given a better acceptance address than Mr Clinton a month before, but the messages from Houston were dominated by the apocalyptic warnings of religious, social and cultural wars pouring from the mouths of Mr Buchanan, the Rev Pat Robertson and Mrs Marilyn Quayle. Deprived of a convention 'bounce,' Mr James Baker, back in the White House saddle, was left pretty much devising strategy from scratch. Initially, this involved some serious attempts to differentiate the president's economic philosophies from Mr Clinton's but, as this too failed to take hold, the approach became progressively negative, first with assaults on Mr Clinton's record in Arkansas and later with the scarcely veiled suggestions that he was unpatriotic and even a coward. Even some traditional Republican advantages - such as finance - became less overwhelming. Both candidates receive equal federal funding (about Dollars 55m each), but the Democrats normally find it harder to raise money from individual and corporate contributions. However, they raised Dollars 43.5m from July to September, and the Republicans only Dollars 26.7m. This still left the Republicans with a cumulative edge of Dollars 96.2m to Dollars 69.8m, but it means Mr Clinton has not been short of funds in the home stretch, where it matters. The electoral map has also begun to look less lopsided. The last three Republican victories were based on dominance south of the Mason-Dixon line and west of the Mississippi, with a reasonable split elsewhere. The Democratic choice of Mr Clinton, a border southerner, threw down a gauntlet in the Republican heartland. Mr Bush has never been very popular in California, carrying it only narrowly in 1988. Now it seems long gone, Texas and the deep south look fragile and the mountain states, with their own brand of rugged independence, are unpredictable. Thus, Mr Bush must do much better than he had any reason to hope in the industrial mid-west in order to have a chance. That is a part of the country where, as in California, the recession has bitten most deeply. The US is now a very fragmented electoral market and endorsements matter much less than they used to. Voter participation remains low, especially among minorities, which tends to help Republicans. This year only Mr Perot can be said to have generated real enthusiasm, but, with the possible exception of the Christian right, it is the Democrats who have been conducting the more effective registration drives. Also, while holding on to liberal Democratic constituencies, Mr Clinton has secured some transfers of allegiance from the traditionally solid Republican corporate sector on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Powerful lobbies, such as the National Rifle Association and the various ex-servicemen's groups, have been less public in support of Mr Bush than is usual. One, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, made the firing of a cabinet member a condition for its backing. Mr Bush's refusal to go the last mile in supporting the Brady bill, controlling hand-gun sales, led to a very belated and lukewarm endorsement from the leading police officers' association. There is a widespread assumption that the largest single voting bloc - women  -has sharply turned against the president, because of his opposition to abortion, family leave and other issues of importance to women, not least the provision of economic opportunity. It is not a coincidence that, of the record number of 11 women running for the Senate this year, 10 are Democrats. Mr Clinton's identification with local Democratic candidates seems much closer than Mr Bush's to Republicans. In states like California and Illinois, with popular women Senate candidates, the benefit to Mr Clinton may be considerable. In general, the prevalent anti-incumbent mood does not now seem to threaten Democratic control of Congress and Mr Bush's attempt to blame everything on the those running the legislature simply has not taken hold. With 57 current Senate seats, the Democrats are now openly talking of ending up with at least 60, which happens to be the majority needed to invoke 'cloture' and push legislation through. There will be many new faces in Congress - perhaps more than in any post-war election - but their party loyalties and their legislative agendas remain obscure. The ultimate Republican tactical weapon has been to try and repeat the success wrought by negative advertising in 1988. Mr Clinton is, on personal grounds, an unusually vulnerable presidential candidate. But what worked four years ago has been less effective this year. The Conservative Party's campaign tactics in Britain this spring have been the model for the Bush Republicans, but it is not always automatic that political tactics import easily. In particular the absence of the late Mr Lee Atwater has deprived Mr Bush's effort of an instinct for the jugular. In the last analysis, however, the strategic and tactical factors cannot by themselves win an election if the country has lost sympathy with the character of a candidate, incumbent or otherwise, or if the great common denominator, the economy, has turned sour. This was the great lesson of 1980, which 1992 in many respects now resembles.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BATTLE FOR ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The West  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clinton leads not only in traditionally Democratic states like Washington and Oregon, and in more marginal Colorado, but even in the Republican stronghold of Arizona, which gave Bush more than 60 per cent of its votes in 1988. Most importantly, the economic recession in California appears to have given Clinton an unassailable lead in this state with the most electoral weight in the US.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clinton leads Washington           11 Oregon                7 California           54 Colorado              8 Clinton inclined Arizona               8 New Mexico            5 Montana               3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bush leads Utah                  5 Bush inclined Wyoming               3 Nevada                4 Idaho                 4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clinton leads        80 Clinton inclined     16 Bush leads            5 Bush inclined        11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Midwest  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bush campaigners have all but given up hope in Illinois, and Clinton also appears comfortably ahead in the Great Lakes industrial states of Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In conservative Indiana, and out on the praries of Nebraska, Bush retains a lead, but even Kansas, so heavily Republican that it is usually left out of presidential calculations, is leaning to Clinton.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clinton leads Minnesota            10 Missouri             11 Illinois             22 Michigan             18 Ohio                 21 Clinton inclined South Dakota          3 Kansas                6 Wisconsin            11 Iowa                  7 Indiana              12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bush leads            0 Bush inclined Nebraska              5 North Dakota (3) - too close to predict  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clinton leads        82 Clinton inclined     39 Bush leads            0 Bush inclined         5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The South  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- While the South continues to vote Democratic in congressional elections, its presidential votes have been solidly Republican in recent years.

This would translate into a landslide in terms of the 538 electoral college votes. Excludes Florida, Oklahoma & N. Dakota as too close to predict.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
19921001000000000	FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Block vote for unions cut to 70%. LABOUR yesterday agreed the first significant cut for 70 years in the trade unions' ability to control conference, reducing the controversial block vote from nearly 90 per cent to 70 per cent of the total. The chief beneficiaries of the change are individual party members in the constituency parties, who will see their voting power next year rise from 12 per cent to 30 per cent. But the hopes of a reformist faction to push through a one-member, one-vote system for the selection of MPs and the election of the party leader will have to await a review. After a rare outbreak of passionate debate, which also saw the first heckling of the week, the conference voted by an overwhelming majority to let a national executive committee working party draw up its own proposals. Speaking for the NEC, Mr Richard Rosser made clear that the leadership's policy continued to favour the one-member, one-vote system for parliamentary selections and an end to the process being obligatory. However, opposition in the hall suggested that some unions will continue to resist the change, which would end their rights to participate through electoral colleges. In a lengthy and often confused debate, which included pressure for all-women selection lists to raise the number of female MPs, delegate after delegate reaffirmed their faith in the links between the unions and the party they formed nearly a century ago. There were also clear differences between those who wish to see no significant reforms and those who would like to make the relationship with the unions informal, with their powers replaced in the organisation by a party controlled by individual members. Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, steered a delicate path between the two camps by drumming up support for the review group. He said the working party would 'modernise' the relationship, legitimise the union role in the minds of the public at large, remove abuses and help to win the statutory political fund ballots. He argued that the unions, both through funding and as a force for stability, tempering extremism, had kept Labour 'in touch with reality'. Traditionalists were more vocal, with one delegate warning that the consequences of a party based purely on individual membership would be to turn Labour into 'a middle-class pressure group'. Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU transport union, argued for the working party, but made clear that he believed reforms should be limited, insisting that there was no evidence the issue had any bearing on Labour's election defeat. The modernisers disagreed, saying the public display of union influence in Mr John Smith's election as leader had damaged the party's image. One, Mr Mohammed Afzal, once involved in a fierce dispute with the electricians' union over his attempt to become a party candidate, claimed that he would be appearing as an MP had the unions not intervened. A series of card votes meant that final decisions on the motions will not be known until conference resumes today. However, there are few doubts that, with the help of the union block vote, the NEC's positions will be upheld.
19921105000000000	FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (The Results): Invading the gentlemen's club. CALIFORNIAN voters have broken ground by electing two women to the US Senate, the first time that any state has done so. 'Washington, ready or not, here we come]' declared Mrs Dianne Feinstein, pictured above (right), at a joint victory rally in San Francisco with fellow-Democratic Senator-elect Barbara Boxer. In all, women won six seats in the Senate, often derided as 'the most exclusive men's club in the world'. Ms Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois became the first black woman to win a Senate seat, and only the third black person to serve there. She had faced controversy in the final weeks of her campaign over alleged financial irregularities, but overcame them to beat her Republican opponent Mr Rich Williamson. Democrat Ms Patty Murray, a self-styled 'mom in tennis shoes', won a Senate seat from Washington State. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland was re-elected. Ms Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, whose seat was not at stake, remains the only Republican woman senator. 'We will be the Cagney and Lacey one-two punch for the state of California,' Mrs Feinstein said, referring to the two female detectives in a popular TV show. Mrs Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, unseated Mr John Seymour, the Republican picked by Governor Pete Wilson to fill out the rest of his term in the US Senate. With just two years to run in this partial term, she will face re-election in 1994. Well known throughout the state following her failed 1990 campaign for governor, Mrs Feinstein, 59, won 54 per cent of votes against 37 per cent for her opponent. Mrs Boxer, a five-term member of the House of Representatives, narrowly defeated right-wing Republican Bruce Herschensohn. She won renown for blowing the whistle on Pentagon spending on overpriced toilet seats and coffee pots. However, she was rated the biggest spender in Congress by the National Taxpayers Union. In one of the bitterest fights, Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, two-term Republican from New York who spent millions of dollars on negative television commercials, won a narrow re-election victory over Mr Robert Abrams, his Democratic challenger. Mr D'Amato took 51 per cent of the vote against 49 per cent for Mr Abrams. The plain-spoken Mr D'Amato's favourite campaign greeting was: 'How are ya doin', Big Guy]' When he gave his victory speech at 1.20 in the morning, the senator told his supporters: 'I'm not a diplomat. I'm your advocate. I'm a fighter.' Mr Abrams, a traditional New York liberal Democrat who is the state's attorney-general, made much of the repeated investigations into alleged ethics violations by Mr D'Amato. In exchange, the senator accused Mr Abrams of not paying his taxes on a country home.
19921105000000000	FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (The Results): Congress incumbents hang on but many terms are limited. ASK American voters what they think of Congress members in general and they will boo; ask them what they think about their own member in particular and they will cheer. Campaign strategists and political pundits agreed that this conventional wisdom would be turned on its head this year by a wave of anger against incumbents. In fact, incumbents fought back, often against damaging personal accusations and strong challengers, to win re-election. Voters still booed incumbents in general, by voting overwhelmingly to limit the number of terms that can be served by elected officials in each of 14 states that had such a proposition on the ballot. But, for the most part, they cheered their own representatives, re-electing most of the incumbents who had seemed at risk. Many members of Congress saw their electoral majorities reduced, and two dozen incumbents were defeated in the House of Representatives - a substantial figure, but a far cry from the dire predictions. Prominent victims included Mr Richard Ray of Georgia's third Congressional district, an important voice on defence issues, and Mr Thomas Downey of New York, a member of the House Ways and Means committee who, only 43, had served 18 years in the House and built a reputation as a substantial author of legislation. Public outrage over the abuse of the generous overdraft facilities for members by the House's private bank continued to wreak havoc. Among its victims were Ms Mary Rose Oakar and Mr Bob McEwen, both of Ohio, while Mr Nicholas Mavroules in Massachusetts and Mr Albert Bustamante in Texas were laid low by broader accusations of financial misdeeds. In the Senate, North Carolina voters were deterred from re-electing Mr Terry Sanford by his recent heart surgery, while Wisconsin's electorate spurned Senator Bob Kasten in favour of Mr Russ Feingold. Mr John Seymour, as expected, failed to hold the Senate seat to which Mr Pete Wilson appointed him when he himself left the Senate to become governor of California. Yet endangered incumbents from both parties, such as Republican Newt Gingrich in Georgia and Democrat Romano Mazzoli in Kentucky shook off their challengers. None of the senior House leaders who had been tipped as possible upsets, such as Speaker Tom Foley, Ways and Means committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, or Armed Services committee chairman Les Aspin, was defeated. In the upper chamber, too, Senator John Glenn survived in Ohio, although his involvement with Mr Charles Keating, head of a collapsed savings and loan body, stripped him of some of his space hero's aura. The new House of Representatives is expected to have 105 new members, nearly a quarter of its 435 total. The 100-member Senate, which elects a third of its members for six-year terms in every two-yearly election, will see 11 new members. Overall, the Congress will wear a different face, with greatly increased representation for women, Hispanics and African-Americans. This is particularly true for the Senate. Ms Barbara Mikulski, one of only two women in the Senate, easily won re-election in Maryland. She will be joined by two newly elected Democratic women from California - Ms Dianne Feinstein and Ms Barbara Boxer - as well as by Ms Patty Murray from Washington state and Ms Carol Moseley Braun from Illinois. Ms Braun will be the first black woman US senator. For all this change, and despite the election of a Democrat to the White House for the first time in 12 years, the new Congress may be prone to the gridlock that agitated voters during the campaign. The Democrats will retain solid control of the House. With a few seats still outstanding, their majority was expected to shrink to from 266 to 259, with Republican representation growing from 166 to 175. There is also one independent, Mr Bernard Sanders, the socialist member for Vermont. In the Senate, the Democrats have, so far, a net gain of one seat. That could be negated, however, for Senator Wyche Fowler of Georgia narrowly failed to win an outright majority, and must proceed to a run-off against Mr Paul Coverdell. In any event, the Democrats have failed to achieve the 60-member majority needed to override filibusters. This failure could put a brake on their ability to push through a sweeping legislative agenda. Democrats won eight of the 12 governorships up for election on Tuesday, picking up North Carolina, Missouri and Delaware from the Republicans, but losing North Dakota.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CLINTON'S ELECTORAL ROMP PAST BUSH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE WEST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Governor Clinton, as             ELECTORAL expected, swept California,      COLLEGE which President Bush had         VOTES            CLINTON      BUSH given up for lost.

19930304000000000	FT  04 MAR 93 / Swiss MPs reject woman as minister. IT WAS no big surprise yesterday when a majority of (male) Swiss parliamentarians voted down the nomination of Mrs Christiane Brunner to join the country's seven-person Federal Council (cabinet). Women have made little headway in Switzerland's senior government and business circles. The new cabinet minister this time had to be, like the outgoing foreign minister, Mr Rene Felber, a Social Democratic party MP from the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Mrs Brunner, 46, and a trade union leader, was one of only two MPs to fit this profile and agreed to be a candidate. She would have been only the second woman minister in Swiss history. In spite of being an MP for only 15 months, she won her party's endorsement, partly because she was a woman and partly because she came from Geneva, a canton which has not been represented in the cabinet for more than 70 years. (Geneva was ready to declare a school holiday if she had won.) But her casual manner and taste in clothes raised eyebrows in the male-dominated political establishment, as did the fact that she has had three husbands. After her rejection, women's groups gathered in front of parliament, threw paint bombs and vowed to continue the tough battle for equality. Mrs Brunner herself was in no doubt about the meaning of the vote. 'I am disappointed not for myself, but for all women in Switzerland.'
19930506000000000	FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (6): 'We can give an example to Europe' - Interview with the president. IAN RODGER talks to Adolf Ogi, transport minister and this year's president of the Swiss Confederation. QUESTION: In spite of the rejection by the Swiss people in a referendum last December 6 of the government's proposal to join the European Economic Area, you are maintaining your policy of seeking closer links with the European Community. What paths can you follow and what problems will you face? ANSWER: Our main goals now are to avoid isolation and possible discrimination arising from our non-participation in the EEA. That means we must pursue bilateral relations with the EC with a view to concluding certain agreements. We are fully aware that we cannot get bilaterally what we have rejected multilaterally. Nonetheless, we are not going on our knees. We have a range of assets which are of interest to the EC. For example, they need fast 'just in time' transportation systems through the Swiss Alps. I also think we can give an example to the new Europe of how to function if you accept certain rules. We are a country with four languages, four cultures and 26 cantons. We know that it is not normal that a country like ours can live in peace and freedom. We know that we have to work every day so that this construction, Confoederatio Helvetica, can go on and become stronger. So we think we have something to offer to Europe, and that Europe has absolutely no interest in putting us in a corner. So far, the EC appears to be proving reluctant to negotiate a bilateral air agreement. Is there anything Switzerland can do to accelerate the process? We have a new transit agreement with the EC. Under it, we are going to build two new tunnels through the Alps which will be beneficial mainly to our EC neighbours, but we did not ask them for money. (In return, the EC agreed to negotiate a bilateral air agreement with Switzerland.) We have no doubt that the EC will honour its commitments. How soon and under what conditions do you think it would be sensible to seek the approval of the Swiss people for a renewed approach to joining the EEA or the EC itself? We have to be very careful. We do not want to produce another 'No' before Austria, Sweden and Finland have their referendums on joining the EC. Referendums have become important signals in Europe. The one in Liechtenstein - which had a positive result - made the front pages of newspapers. So if there is a second try, we must be sure we can get it through. It is not possible at this time to give a schedule. Things in Europe change so quickly these days. The economy could have an influence, what Denmark and Britain do - everything is interrelated. There is an initiative (petition campaign for a referendum) under way. If it gets a lot of signatures, that could change the situation. But it will definitely not be this year. Has Switzerland's refusal to join the EEA had any concrete impact on the economy? We have both positive and negative signs, but it isn't yet possible to analyse it. And, after all, the EEA isn't yet in force. Since the EEA rejection, the government has launched initiatives to liberalise the Swiss economy unilaterally, in particular a so called Swisslex package of 27 laws. Will these get bogged down or watered down because of pressures from vested interests? Our view is that we have to be economically at least as liberalised as the EC. We had everything going for us for such a long time. Nearly everybody was rich. When you are rich, you do not work as hard as you should. We needed a sort of big bang. We did not need a 'No' to the EEA, but it will wake us up. The government is convinced that if we want to realise the necessary changes, the package aspect is essential. So far, the various parliamentary committees have agreed with us. In a month's time, there will be one referendum on the purchase of new fighter aircraft for the Swiss airforce and another on how much land should be made available to the army for training. Do Switzerland's neighbours need to worry about the country retaining its ability and will to maintain security at this crossroads of the continent? We are the only country where the people can vote on such matters. We had a referendum four years ago on abolishing the army and the great majority voted in favour of keeping it. Tell me another country that would have had such a vote and where the people would have voted yes. I am persuaded that we can win these referendums. We have a well trained and well equipped army. Under our new policy - Army 95 - we are going to make it smaller, but it will be better. We have responsible and well brought up young people. Only a very few do not want to enter the armed services. Do not worry. You will be able to count on Switzerland in the future to look after security at this crossroads of Europe. The EEA vote and the tensions in January and February over the election of a new member to the Cabinet revealed some strong divisions in internal Swiss politics. Do you think that the governing coalition will continue to withstand these strains? The European issue did not lead to extraordinary strains inside the government coalition, but the tensions it produced are much deeper than those during the Cabinet election. We have differences between the French-speaking part and the German-speaking part, between old and young, between those who live in towns and those in the countryside. As president, I have to help get our peoples together again. Differing opinions among the four coalition partners are frequent. We have a very free coalition - there is no written agreement among them - and so we have no precise government programme. Also, we always have changing alliances within the governing coalition. Sometimes, where you come from is more important than your party. The battle over the Cabinet post arose largely because a woman was proposed for the vacancy. Are Swiss women going to remain militant? Yes. We need more women in politics, but I am against quotas. I think it has to develop normally. You have seen this in cantonal elections in recent weeks. In Neuchatel, twice as many women candidates were elected. The Swiss government has been running large deficits in recent years. Are the Swiss becoming like citizens in other countries, wanting more government services but not wanting to pay the taxes to finance them? In my view, the deficit is one of our most important problems, but compared with our European neighbours, we're still doing fairly well. I think we are overcoming the situation. It isn't that we are better than others, but we are still in control of the problem. The deficits are mainly due to the economic slowdown, but a mentality has developed because we were a bit spoiled. Now we are taking off our jackets, rolling up our sleeves and going back to work. But it will take some time before we have a result.
19930417000000000	FT  17 APR 93 / Spring rite keeps Swiss woman in her place at home / A look at obstacles to women having a role in national life. ON MONDAY afternoon, a strange annual spring tribal rite will be played out on the streets of Zurich. According to a 650-year-old tradition, the (male) pillars of the city's business establishment will dress up in medieval garb and, having had slap up lunches in the halls of their various guilds (zunfts), will parade down the streets of the old city on foot or on horseback. The procession ends in a city park where a symbolic figure of winter, known as Boogg and capable of being pronounced only by Swiss, is put to the torch. The strangest part of this ritual is the audience. Lining the streets will be mainly the men's wives, mistresses, secretaries and other female friends and acquaintances, many of whom will have been dragooned into being there. Their role is to throw flowers at their preening menfolk. The man who accumulates the most flowers by the end of the parade acquires new prestige. He is easily identifiable because he will have acquired a woman assistant along the way to help carry his load of flowers. Whatever else may be said about this festival, called Sechselauten, it is an example of male domination in Swiss society. This is the country, after all, where women have had the right to vote only since 1971, and that only at the federal level. The tiny half canton of Appenzell Inner Rhodes (population 13,600) was finally forced by a federal court just three years ago to give their women the vote in local matters. Swiss women are still not permitted to work night shifts in factories and they have so far made little headway in senior business circles. Moreover, strong social and logistical pressures force them to stay home and look after their children. Primary school schedules, for example, are perversely arbitrary. A mother of two may find that one child must attend school for two hours early in the morning and two hours late in the afternoon, while the other has different hours. She is thus in effect prevented from taking a regular job. Swiss women soldiers have only been allowed to carry firearms since 1991 - just pistols for self protection. The army is undoubtedly one of the main clues to the strong strain of misogyny in Switzerland. The Swiss army is a militia force in which every able-bodied male must serve for an average of three weeks every two years until he is 50. While on army service, men from Switzerland's many different social and cultural backgrounds rub shoulders and assess each other thoroughly in trying circumstances. They then take the contacts and assessments back and apply them in their civilian lives with a confidence that they could never extend to women. Meanwhile, women's main role in the country's defence is to stay home, look after the children and do their menfolk's laundry which is sent back regularly from the front by special free post. There are signs Swiss leaders have finally recognised that they must change their ways. A few leading companies have appointed a token woman to their board. The army held its first mixed 17-week training course for recruits in March. The air force will begin training its first women pilots in May. But Swiss women are also growing more impatient, as was demonstrated three months ago when a woman, Ms Christiane Brunner, was put up for election to the federal cabinet. The overwhelmingly male parliament, which had only once before agreed to put a woman in the country's supreme governing council, bristled. Ms Brunner was attacked for her militant feminism, her casual dress habits and her past - she has had three husbands. To the surprise of the parliamentarians, women throughout the country stood up and protested against this muck-raking. In the end Ms Brunner was not elected, but the parliamentarians felt obliged to vote in another woman, Ms Ruth Dreyfuss. Ms Dreyfuss made clear that her views were identical to those of Ms Brunner, notably on the idea that some day women should be in the majority in the cabinet. If that ever happened, their first move might be to outlaw Sechselauten.
19930617000000000	FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs turn down vote change. LABOUR MPs yesterday rejected proposals to reform the system for electing party's chief whip. A meeting of the parliamentary party voted to keep separate elections for the chief whip and his deputy. The PLP backed a proposal to increase from three to four the number of women that Labour MPs must vote for in shadow cabinet elections.
19930615000000000	FT  15 JUN 93 / Women's advance reflects a fast-changing Turkey: John Murray Brown puts the Moslem country's first female prime minister in her place. THE ELECTION by Turkey's largest party of Mrs Tansu Ciller as party leader and the country's first woman prime minister was explained in one Ankara newspaper by the story that wives of the men who voted had threatened a collective withdrawal of conjugal rights if she did not win. Mischievous perhaps - the newspaper or the wives, depending on the truth - but the story illustrates the point that there is a growing group of Turkish women asserting themselves in ways which to the outsider may seem at odds with Turkey's image as a conservative Moslem country. And Mrs Ciller is one such woman. She is unlikely to be quite as forthright as one of Turkey's most eminent woman professors who told a recent conference that 'women's equality must start in bed'. But her advocacy of women's rights seems certain to occupy a high priority in her policy agenda as she starts her first day as Turkey's new leader. The 47-year-old US-trained economist, is already well-known for having a husband who took her maiden name. Drop into her office in the new prime ministry and you are as likely to find a group of Turkish girl guides lobbying her support, as a moustachioed male adviser on the economy. Turkey is changing dramatically, and women offer dramatic illustration of those changes. Sociologists point out that the Turks were historically a matriarchal society. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the country's founder, enshrined women's equal rights, gave them the vote in 1932 before much of Europe, banned the Moslem 'chador' or veil, saw women elected to the new parliament, even sent a women's team to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Women account for two in 5 physicists and chemists; one in six lawyers, judges and public prosecutors; one in six doctors; one in 10 government administrators and one in 30 managers of private corporations. In 1991, Turkey appointed its first woman provincial governor. Previously the feeble reason given to exclude women from the post was that governors were required to travel on horseback - something which was deemed unseemly and quite possibly dangerous for a woman official. By law women need their husbands' permission to work. Women are not allowed to remarry within a year after a divorce. A number of municipalities have established safe houses to treat women battered by their husbands, still a widespread phenomenon. But it is among the less-educated and particularly in rural areas where women face the greater uphill struggle for their rights. According to a study by the World Bank and the Erzurum University, women account for a 59 per cent of the labour force, a statistic reinforced by the briefest of contacts with the Turkish countryside where the sight of one man 'herding' a team of women in a field of chickpeas is not unusual. Mrs Semra Ozal,wife of the late president Mr Turgut Ozal, did much to raise the profile of women. Her Daisies foundation travelled the countryside converting thousands of religious marriages into civil contracts, giving women equal rights in inheritance and claims on children in a divorce. The junior partners in the coalition, the Social Democrats have suggested a quota system in parliament to ensure an even hand for women. People point out that there were more women in parliament in Ataturk's time than today where there are just eight deputies in the 450-member chamber. The strongest female representation is in the right-wing Motherland party, with four women members. Mrs Ciller's True Path party has two. In the old coalition, Mrs Ciller was one of just two women ministers. Her former ministerial colleague, Mrs Guler Ileri, a Social Democrat, was forced to resign, the only casualty of the coalition government, over allegations she purloined state funds allocated for a children's orphanage. Today the only thing anyone remembers about Mrs Ileri is that she succeeded in having a coiffure for women opened in the parliament building.
19930701000000000	FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to repay Pounds 11,000 donation. LABOUR'S National Executive Committee yesterday agreed unanimously to repay Pounds 11,000 donated by a Greek Cypriot businessman at the centre of a fraud investigation. The cash, donated by Mr Charilaos Costa, a clothing manufacturer, will be immediately withdrawn from Labour's account and put aside while receivers for Mr Costa's business are contacted. The NEC also yesterday approved plans for all-women shortlists for the selection of candidates in half the constituencies where the sitting Labour MP is retiring or where there is a good chance of defeating another party.
19930930000000000	FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Arm-twisting allies win the day in late show. MR JOHN PRESCOTT, the Labour traditionalist's traditionalist, and the left-wing MSF white-collar union were the unlikely heroes of Mr John Smith's victory. A barnstorming speech by Mr Prescott, fast becoming the Labour conference's Michael Heseltine in his ability to appeal to the party's grassroots, ended in an urgent appeal to delegates. He contrasted the modernisers within the party who blamed the unions for the election defeat with the way Mr Smith had 'put his head on the block by saying, 'I fervently believe in a strong relationship between the trade unions and the Labour party'.' His speech was the outward sign of frantic behind-the-scenes and last-minute efforts by the leadership to win over as many delegates as possible by arm-twisting and persuasion. MPs with local parties against the change were told to ring their general management committees back in the constituencies and put pressure on them, while those with 'sound' constituency parties were told to talk to other local parties or to the smaller unions. The National Communications Union delegation met seven times and was repeatedly lobbied by senior party members, including Mr Neil Kinnock, the former party leader, before deciding that they would persist in their opposition to the rule changes. Mr Kinnock was among the most active figures, seeing delegates and putting the argument for change loyally and effectively in a series of television and radio interviews. Mr John Major must envy Mr Smith his predecessor. But as late as lunchtime - after Mr Smith had made his speech - his aides were saying that up to 250 constituency parties were undecided or proving hard to pin down. Then came the turning points, with the decision for Mr Prescott to wind up the debate, and with a meeting of the MSF - which was already committed to vote for the TGWU motion which the leadership opposed. Away from the conference hall, at the supposedly secret location of the Brighthelm community and civic centre, the delegation met and decided by just two votes - 19 to 17 - not to cast their 4.5 per cent of the conference vote against the rule change, but to abstain. Ms Hilary Armstrong, Mr Smith's parliamentary aide and an MP sponsored by the MSF, is credited with finding the way out for the leadership by highlighting how the changes to parliamentary selection procedures would affect women. The MSF's opposition to the change in the role of the unions, was cancelled out by their support for its moves to increase the number of women candidates. It worked, but anger at the way in which the two issues had been linked showed through in some of the speeches from delegates who felt outmanoeuvred. At the end of the debate, Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, could only watch as Mr Prescott won his second standing ovation of the conference. She had lost any chance she might have had of making that speech by virtue of her less than enthusiastic support for Mr Smith earlier in the week. Talk in the corridors and bars turned quickly to speculation that Mr Prescott would and should run for the deputy leadership next year. Just before 6pm, after a day of impassioned argument, two voting procedures and six different coloured ballot papers, to cheers and applause from most - but not all - sections of the audience, the conference heard that the rule change had been passed. Mr Smith's margin of victory on the key vote was below 3.5 per cent - less than the size of the MSF vote. It had been about an additional payment for union political levy payers of just Pounds 3 a year, but it had also been about the leadership of the party.
19930930000000000	FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Rigid seat quotas for women are rejected. A MOTION calling on the party leadership to adopt a more rigid system of quotas, with women-only shortlists in every Labour seat falling vacant, was defeated. But a resolution backing women-only shortlists in 50 per cent of seats becoming vacant was carried. Mr John Spellar, MP for Warley West, provoked an angry reaction from some delegates when he spoke against quotas. He said such a system would lead to the imposition of candidates on constituencies by Labour headquarters, and warned the proposals would lead to 'massive resentments and demoralisation in local parties.'
19930930000000000	FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: NEC backs quota system for women. THE leadership yesterday appealed to the party to back plans to boost the number of women MPs. Ms Brenda Etchells of the national executive committee put proposals to delegates for a system whereby all-woman shortlists for parliamentary candidates should be drawn up in 50 per cent of all winnable seats, and 50 per cent of those that become vacant when a sitting MP retires.
