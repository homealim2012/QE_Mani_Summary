The Breakup of Czechoslovakia Discuss the events leading to the breakup of Czechoslovakia the formation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the outlook for these nations after one year.
When Mr Helmut Kohl the German chancellor arrives in Czechoslovakia at the end of this month he will sign a treaty of friendship aimed at healing wounds that have festered since German forces divided the country during the Second World War.
New political forces arising from the collapse of the Soviet bloc together with the deep rooted Slovak nationalism are threatening to split the country again into its Czech and Slovak components.
In the two years since the collapse of the communist government in Prague the Czech and Slovak republics have been unable to agree a political basis for their future coexistence in one country.
General elections in June are likely to see advocates of greater autonomy win a majority in the Slovakian parliament further increasing pressure on the country s fragile federal structure.
As in the republics of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia the lifting of communist rule has shown up latent divisions.
The federal government in Prague will be hoping that it can reach agreement on a new federal structure without the upheavals suffered elsewhere in eastern Europe.
Tension has been exacerbated by growing nationalism in Slovakia the smaller and poorer republic which is home to a third of the country s 15m population.
A powerful faction within the Christian Democrats the biggest party in the republic s coalition government is calling for greater autonomy as is the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by the demagogic Mr Vladimir Meciar.
Such calls are resisted by the Czech dominated federal government.
While Czech politicians and the federal government have accepted the need for negotiations on the country s political structure they resist a weakening in the existing powers of the central government.
For the federal government and for pro federation politicians in Slovakia Mr Meciar poses a growing threat.
Recent polls indicate that 27 per cent of Slovak voters support him.
While stopping short of demanding independence he is seeking increased powers for the Slovak parliament.
He also wants the federal government to slow the pace of its economic reform.
Slovakian nationalists such as Mr Meciar are capitalising on a revived sense of Slovak identity.
Or as Ms Zuzana Weberova a young factory worker in central Slovakia puts it.
He makes us feel like we are born again like we can suddenly speak out again.
Slovakia has always felt like a poor relation of the Czech republic.
Besides a short spell when a pro Nazi regime declared its independence during the Second World War it has never exorcised its 19th century dream of nationhood says Mr Jan Morovic a university professor in Bratislava the Slovak capital.
Aspirations to nationhood are echoed by Mr Milan Knazko an adviser to Mr Meciar.
We must recreate a democratic nation incorporate it with the Czechs and then into the European Community.
Such ideas are heard frequently across the political spectrum in Slovakia.
Mr Jan Carnogursky the Slovak prime minister and leader of the Christian Democrats has thrown doubt on his party s commitment to the Czechoslovak federation.
He speaks of Slovakia s future star on the European Community flag.
Emerging Slovak nationalism has been fuelled by economic difficulties.
The collapse of the Soviet market which represented the principal source of demand for Slovakian industrial production has prompted a fall in output and a loss of jobs.
8 per cent by the end of 1991 twice the level in the Czech republic.
In some Slovak regions especially those which rely upon the defence industry unemployment has passed 20 per cent.
In particular the preponderance of inefficient Soviet plant and equipment has hampered adjustment to a more market based system.
Slovakia has attracted a mere 4 per cent of the estimated Dollars 800m of foreign investment which has flowed into Czechoslovakia in the past two years.
Slovak politicians believe the federal government does not have the republic s economic interests at heart.
They have criticised the decision to wind down and eventually phase out the country s production of arms the bulk of which is made in Slovakia.
Mr Meciar who promises to maintain the republic s defence industry also wants state subsidies to be kept in place for ailing enterprises as well as softer loans for industry.
The problem with the nationalists ill defined economic programme is that it would run against the radical reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund which were drawn up last year and are being implemented across the country.
The reforms include privatisation and anti inflationary measures such as a tight monetary policy and restrictions on government expenditure.
The danger for the federal government in Prague is that it will no longer be able to implement such policies in a more independence minded Slovakia.
As the two republics pursue their diverging paths pressures for a complete break will become harder to control.
FT 02 JUN 92 Master Slovak politician shakes the federalist foundation.
The word independence may be avoided but the rhetoric is unambiguous.
STANDING in the medieval square of the small town of Banska Stvianica in central Slovakia Mr Vladimir Meciar the most popular politician in the republic works the crowd with the well trained techniques he learned in his boxing career.
His large silhouette positioned beneath the statue of Saint Sebastian he answers written questions allegedly gathered from the crowd.
In well prepared verbal blows Mr Meciar displays his wit as he blends political slogans with well timed jokes about his enemies.
An expected winner in Friday s elections for the regional republic s parliament the Slovak National Council he knows when to strike.
Since joining the opposition in the assembly after a spell as regional prime minister a year ago his popularity increased in parallel with the growth of nationalism in Slovakia the smaller of the two republics in the Czechoslovak federation.
With an average 30 per cent support in the opinion polls for his party the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and support from other smaller parties he represents the greatest threat facing the federation since the demise of communism.
I told Mr Havel (the federal president) that we will no longer ask him what to do] The people of Banska Stvianica applaud enthusiastically.
The party s programme calls on the Slovak parliament to declare the republic s sovereignty.
He has also promised to push through a constitution which would take precedence over the federal one.
He says that a referendum would then be put if the Czechs and Slovaks continue to disagree.
Representatives of the Czech and Slovak governments have been unable to agree a post communist relationship.
As negotiations continued to fail and Slovakia s unemployment rate soared to three times that of neighbouring Czech lands nationalists fuelled the growing resentment against the federal government.
The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia receives between 25 and 34 per cent in the various opinion polls but his policies also have the backing of other parties with which he might be able to construct a parliamentary majority.
Moreover together they could put together a strong bloc in the federal parliament in partnership with the Czech republic s left wing parties.
Right wing politicians have warned in Prague that his victory could herald the end of a workable federal parliament.
Mr Meciar s calls for increased state subsidies for ailing enterprises has won the support of the Democratic Left Party the renamed communist party which while allegedly pro federation is calling for greater state intervention in the transition to a free market.
Led by a charismatic and relatively young man Mr Petr Weiss it gets about 12 per cent in the polls.
His party is also supported by smaller but equally nationalist parties in Slovakia such as the Slovak National Party the only party to call openly for independence.
It has an estimated 10 per cent support in the Slovak population.
Careful to avoid the word independence Mr Meciar talks about increased autonomy.
Polls show that only a small minority wants outright independence.
If we want to be the equal of other countries in Europe he told his Banska Stvianica rally we have to join it as separate state.
We must be able to take decisions by ourselves and with our own money.
President Havel after a recent meeting with Mr Meciar warned of dangerous ideas about the possibility of dissolving the common state from above and constituting fully independent republics.
Speaking at the opening of his own electoral campaign Mr Havel stressed that this would lead to nothing but a chaotic break up of the state.
Talks about dividing the two republics pervade the discourse of all political parties in both the republics as voting day approaches.
Faced with the possibility of an unworkable federal parliament Czech right wing parties which head the opinion polls in their republic have signalled an unwillingness to compromise.
I do not rule out the possibility of two countries emerging Mr Meciar told the crowd but it will be because the Czechs were unable to co operate with us.
The crowd applauds seeming to have forgotten entirely that it was his own party that opposed all tentative agreements between the republics.
FT 10 JUN 92 Prague seeks to escape deadlock.
THE newly elected leaders of the Czech and Slovak republics have agreed to try to form quickly an interim federal government despite deep differences over the future federal state revealed at their first meeting which ended early yesterday.
Mr Vaclav Klaus Czech leader of the Civic Democratic party (ODS) said the six hour meeting revealed completely different positions on the future of the 74 year old federation.
He said the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by Mr Vladimir Meciar was not interested in a common state.
They are for a vague economic and defence union a community of two sovereign states modelled more on the Visegrad Alliance (between Czechoslovakia Hungary and Poland) or a mini European Community than a federation he said.
We have no illusion about the chances for success and stability for such an unusual configuration At a press conference Mr Klaus reiterated that his party demanded what he called a working federation continuation of economic reforms and the re election of Mr Vaclav Havel as president as the basis for a reformed federal state.
The Slovak leader has publicly refused to support President Havel s candidature and declared his intention to proclaim a sovereign Slovakia with its own constitution and president.
He has also expressed radically different economic ideas including the demand for a Slovak central bank.
Mr Klaus said the two sides had not even started to discuss economic matters during their talks which will resume in Prague tomorrow.
However they agreed on the need to form an interim federal government as soon as possible and will discuss details of a skeleton administration at their next meeting.
Mr Klaus said that the first round of talks which took place in Brno the Moravian capital halfway between Prague and Bratislava took place in a calm and business like manner.
In spite of the depth of their disagreements neither wants to be seen as being responsible for a future Break up of the federal state.
FT 10 JUN 92 Republics caught in great divide.
THE CRISIS over Czechoslovakia s future as a federal state is taking place against the background of a political landscape which has already been transformed by last weekend s elections.
The anti communist intellectuals who kept passive resistance alive after the 1968 Soviet invasion and led the velvet revolution of November 1989 have been eclipsed.
Their movements the Civic Forum in the Czech lands and its Slovak version the former Public Against Violence were already gravely weakened by earlier splits.
Both failed to gain the 5 per cent of votes needed for seats in parliament.
The consequent departure of men like Mr Jiri Dienstbier the foreign minister and 12 other members of the outgoing 18 man federal government has weakened President Vaclav Havel.
He looks like an isolated monument from that brief period of euphoria when poets and philosophers replaced apparatchiks.
His re election next month has been threatened by the opposition of Slovak nationalists and former communists although he retains the affection of many ordinary Czechs and Slovaks.
But the polarisation of politics between left wing nationalists in Slovakia and right wing market reformers in the Czech lands which has put the federation at risk has also weakened other centrist parties like the former ruling Christian Democrats in Slovakia.
The erosion of the centre and the return to respectability of the communists especially in their reformed and renamed Slovak version under the young and personable Mr Peter Weiss has greatly narrowed the victors scope for coalition forming.
In Slovakia Mr Vladimir Meciar the former communist whose nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) just failed to win an overall majority in the Slovak National Council has to choose between Mr Jozef Prokes leader of the outright separatist Slovak National Party or the Democratic Left Party (DLS) of Mr Weiss.
First indications after talks with both leaders yesterday are that Mr Meciar is leaning towards the reform communists.
An alliance with the DLS would give Mr Meciar both more seats and more flexibility in talks on the federal future.
The choices open to Mr Vaclav Klaus whose Civic Democratic Movement won 80 out of 300 seats in the federal assembly are more limited.
The size of his electoral success squeezed out his naturally the Civiv Democratic Alliance (CDA) and his right hand man Mr Vladimir Dlouby the former federal economics minister.
The failure of the Civic Democratic Alliance to surmount the 5 per cent barrier means that Mr Klaus will need other allies than a handful of Czech and Slovak Christian Democrats.
In order to confront the Slovak nationalists and Czech and Slovak ex communists ranged against him in the federal parliament he needs a deal with the Social Democrats who up to now he has dismissed as unrealistc believers in a third way between capitalism and communism.
Ironically a decision to end the federation would greatly simplify politics in both republics.
Both Mr Meciar and Mr Klaus dominate their republican parliaments and would be able to implement policies which would move both halves of the present republic in opposite directions.
FT 11 JUN 92 Slovaks rule out talks with Havel.
THE prospects for successful talks on the future of the Czechoslovak federation faltered again yesterday as the Slovak nationalists ruled out a meeting with the Czechoslovak president Mr Vaclav Havel.
Mr Vladimir Meciar the newly elected leader in the Slovak republic and his Czech counterpart Mr Vaclav Klaus were to meet President Havel today in Prague to continue their attempts to agree on a reduced federal state which would bind the Czech and Slovak republics together.
Mr Havel s presidential re election could become the biggest stumbling bloc in negotiating a federal structure.
Mr Meciar has pledged to bloc the re election of Mr Havel in the federal parliament after the latter called on voters not to support candidates with dictatorial tendencies.
But the Czech side has refused to back down on its support for the president with Mr Klaus saying it was the basis for any further negotiations.
A first meeting between Mr Meciar and Mr Klaus on Monday night only revealed the extend to which both men disagree over the future of the country with Mr Klaus unambiguously rejecting the Slovak demands for some sort of economic and defence union.
Mr Klaus however called for the quick formation of a government before July 5 when the presidential election is due in the federal parliament.
But Mr Meciar told reporters this scenario was highly unlikely.
According to Mr Meciar any federal structure would be temporary until a referendum on independence is held in Slovakia possibly by the end of the year.
He also said that a referendum should be initiated by the Slovak parliament and not the federal parliament as the law currently stipulates.
The new Slovak parliament is likely to take a series of measures violating federal law.
Mr Meciar together with Mr Peter Weiss leader of the renamed communist party in Slovakia which came out second in last weekend s elections said they would immediately abolish in the republic the federal law which forbids former high ranking communist officials and secret police agents from holding public office for five years.
Mr Meciar is believed by his opponents to have removed in his short spell as Slovak interior minister after the revolution any incriminating evidence on his relations to the hated secret police.
The break up of Czechoslovakia would probably lead to a significant renegotiation of at least the trade elements of the country s association agreement with the European Community according to a senior Czechoslovak official writes Ian Rodger in Basle.
One party to the agreement would no longer exist so we would have to negotiate separate agreements or else find some modus vivendi Mr Zdenek Drabek of the federal economics ministry said.
Mr Drabek was attending a conference on problems in eastern Europe sponsored by the Institute for East West Studies.
FT 12 JUN 92 Prague talks end in deadlock.
A SECOND round of talks between the newly elected Czech and Slovak leaders on the future of the Czechoslovak federation ended in deadlock last night bringing closer the possibility of a formal split between the two republics.
After nine hours of talks Mr Vaclav Klaus Czech winner in the poll admitted no agreement had been reached with Mr Valdimir Meciar his Slovak counterpart.
We haven t made any progress not a single step forward and the Slovak side continues to refuse our deadline for forming a federal government he said.
Mr Klaus has urged that a new federal government be formed before July 5 when the re election of President Vaclav Havel is due in the federal parliament.
This re election is likely in itself to cause a Czech Slovak clash.
Mr Meciar has refused to support Mr Havel s candidacy while the Czechs have said they will not accept another candidate.
But the Slovak delegation said it could not commit itself to a deadline on forming a new federal structure.
So far it has agreed only to a temporary federal government until a referendum on independence is held in Slovakia towards the end of the year.
FT 15 JUN 92 Slovaks delay talks with Czechs.
Impatience over federation s future prompts call for interim government.
SLOVAK nationalists yesterday postponed negotiations on the future of the Czechoslovak federation with already impatient Czech partners further delaying chances that a federal government may soon be formed to head the country.
Mr Vladimir Meciar the newly elected Slovak leader is due to meet Mr Vaclav Klaus his Czech counterpart for a third round of negotiation over the fate of the contested federation in Prague on Wednesday.
Previous negotiations ended in a complete deadlock last week with Mr Klaus rejecting the demands of Slovaks for a economic and defence union of sovereign states which he termed the end of the common state.
Mr Klaus has instead called for the quick formation of an interim federal government to decide on the fate of the federation.
The Czech leader has insisted that a federal government be created before July 5 when President Vaclav Havel is due to be re elected in the federal parliament which Mr Meciar has pledged to block.
The Slovak leader s decision to delay the third round of negotiations confirmed the attempts by Slovaks to gain time before the first meeting of the federal parliament.
Mr Klaus Civic Democratic party which won 30 per cent of the vote of the Czech republic will have a hard time there as it faces opposition by left wing Czech parties willing to team up with Slovak nationalists.
We want a decision to be made as soon as possible and to know which way we are going but the Slovaks want a long erosion of the federation a member of Mr Klaus party said yesterday.
Mounting exasperation towards Slovak demands is increasingly dominating the Czech mood.
While Slovaks have in principle agreed on an interim federal government they insist that a referendum on a formal break up be held in Slovakia late this year.
But Mr Klaus retorted after the second round of negotiations in Prague on Thursday that the Czechs cannot afford to wait so long.
Meanwhile Czechs angered by the Slovak opposition to re electing Mr Havel have started a petition in Prague calling for a federation or nothing.
In Bratislava yesterday however 2 000 Slovak demonstrators started their own petition in favour of a federation.
Current polls indicate that the bulk of the Slovak population would not favour independence today but the nationalists who together won 45 per cent of the Slovak vote hope this attitude will change by the end of the year especially if they can manage to blame the impatience of the Czechs for breaking up the federation.
FT 20 JUN 92 Czechoslovaks agree to form two nations.
CZECH and Slovak leaders announced early today that they had agreed to prepare the splitting up of Czechoslovakia into two separate states Agencies report from Bratislava.
The announcement came after almost 14 hours of negotiations in Bratislava between teams headed by Mr Vaclav Klaus the Czech leader and his Slovak counterpart Mr Vladimir Meciar.
The planned orderly break up of the 74 year old Czechoslovak federation comes in the wake of elections two weeks ago.
In the poll Mr Meciar s nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) performed strongly in the Slovak region.
Mr Klaus who as finance minister carried through post communist reforms had a political victory in the Czech republic.
The two leaders said they had agreed on forming a new interim federal government and on its functions.
The new government would prepare if it is authorised conditions for a smooth functioning of two sovereign states with international status Mr Klaus said.
The two men said the regional Czech and Slovak parliaments would decide on how best to divide Czechoslovakia into two states.
The legislative process would begin in both parliaments on September 30.
Both victorious political parties consider as a common task to initiate by constitutional means a process that will lead by September 30 to an agreement between National Councils (regional parliaments) on the issue of the state set up.
Mr Meciar had wanted to transform Czechoslovakia into a confederation.
But Mr Klaus s Civic Democratic party (ODS) rejected this saying that if the present federation was to be so loosened it would be better to split.
The Slovak side also previously said it wanted a referendum on independence early next year postponing dissolution of the federation until the end of 1993.
But such demands are unacceptable to the Czechs who fear the crisis could delay integration with the west.
FT 22 JUN 92 A velvet divorce but a rough road to single life.
The Czech and Slovak republics will face difficult challenges after separation.
The federal parliament which convenes today in Prague will almost certainly be the last.
Only the unlikely prospect of a popular revolt against the decisions of its recently elected political leaders can now save the Czechoslovak federal state.
A new interim federal government to be made up of Czechs and Slovaks in equal measure will oversee the separation of the state which was formed in 1918.
Its function will be limited mainly to overseeing an orderly transition of federal powers to the Czech and Slovak national parliaments by September 30.
The dissolution of the post communist state of Czechoslovakia which was regarded as perhaps the most promising candidate for full European Community membership will have repercussions well beyond its borders.
It is further evidence that the fragmentation of Eastern Europe most tragically experienced by Yugoslavia is continuing.
The decision by the two republics to divorce taken in the early hours of Saturday morning comes only two weeks after general elections which revealed the strength of Slovak resentment against the government in Prague.
Rejecting arguments that Slovakia s future will be best assured by firm linkage to the Czech economic locomotive 60 per cent of the electorate voted for parties which were either nationalist or socialist or both.
That vote provided the mandate with which Mr Vladimir Meciar went into the talks.
The former boxer is the leader of the nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia which played on the resentments of Slovaks and emerged as the largest party in the republic.
But although Mr Meciar went into the post electoral talks on Czechoslovakia s future as spokesman for the aggrieved party the terms of the proposed divorce bear the strong imprint of the Czech leader Mr Vaclav Klaus.
Before the elections Mr Klaus the former federal finance minister whose Civic Democratic party (ODS) has become the dominant party in the Czech republic openly rejected any soft options such as a looser confederal structure.
At the first round of talks in Brno between Prague the Czech capital and Bratislava the Slovak capital he rejected Mr Meciar s proposed defence and foreign affairs community.
Having received a mandate in the Czech lands for tight monetary policy rapid privatisation and a market economy Mr Klaus turned a deaf ear to Slovak demands for its own central bank and requests for federal funds.
Mr Klaus argued that both sides should either agree on a smaller but more effective federal government dedicated to market orientated economic reforms or on a quick divorce.
After more than a thousand years of domination by Hungary followed by a six year interlude as a puppet state of the Axis powers during the second world war and Stalinist industrialisation after the war Slovakia is therefore faced with the challenge of independence.
It raises questions about the republic s political and economic future and its role in the new Europe.
There is a restive 600 000 strong Hungarian minority and smaller groups of ethnic Poles and Germans.
One of the principal demands made by Slovak nationalists is for Slovakia to enter the European Community as a sovereign state in its own right.
The likelihood is that the western Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia freed of the need to subsidise the economically weaker Slovakia will now move faster on economic and other reforms.
Such policies should allow them to fulfil the preconditions for membership of the EC while Slovakia with its inefficient heavy industries risks sliding backwards economically.
Mr Meciar s tight control over the media and jibes against the Hungarian minority during the election campaign are warning signs which have been noted by the Christian Democrat and other opposition parties during recent weeks.
The international implications of the division of Czechoslovakia into two sovereign internationally recognised states will affect all international treaties and agreements concluded by the Czechoslovak state including the recently signed association agreement with the EC and membership of the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The details of divorce will also require agreement on the division of responsibility for Czechoslovakia s Dollars 9.
1bn net foreign debt as well as the domestic debt and agreement on distributing assets.
At present for example over 80 per cent of Czechoslovakia s 12m tonne annual oil consumption is imported through the Druzhba pipeline which runs across Slovak territory from Russia.
An independent Slovakia will seek higher transit and refining fees from the Czech lands.
To lessen its dependence both on Soviet sources and Slovakia however the Czech republic has already made plans to build a new 3.
4m tonne capacity pipeline to bring oil from Trieste.
One of Bratislava s main economic complaints against Prague is that recent economic reform measures in particular freeing of prices have hit doubly hard in Slovakia.
Officials in the Slovak industry ministry say that because the republic is a supplier of components and semi finished steel to Czech factories and because the products from Slovak factories are in many cases still price controlled Czech factories receive artifically cheap Slovak products which they then sell for valuable hard currency.
The collapse in trade between the former Comecon states which followed the shift to dollar pricing provides a warning about what could happen if the political and economic links between the two republics are severed.
An independent Slovakia would be hard pressed to sell its products to the west except at extremely low prices made possible by a devalued currency.
But this is a dangerous part of the world in which to be small and poor.
The border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia was defined after the first world war by the Treaty of Trianon under which Hungary as part of the defeated Austro Hungarian empire was much diminished.
If they are made to feel second class citizens in an independent Slovakia the Hungarian minority may press Budapest to demand some form of protectorate or even a renegotiation of the borders which would bring them back into Hungary.
That could open a Pandora s box of similar claims from Poland and the Ukraine which would further destabilise a region already apprehensive about the future.
FT 06 JUL 92 Slovak ire seals Havel s fate.
THE failure of President Vaclav Havel one of the last advocates of a unified Czech and Slovak Federation to be re elected to the presidency has put another nail in the coffin of the fragile 74 year old federation.
In a casual atmosphere members of the federal parliament took just one hour on Friday to remove Mr Havel from office.
On the Slovak side of the parliament a handful of MPs managed to block the re election of a man whose popularity and international prestige are the envy of many world statesmen.
Mr Havel s position was compromised by the June 5 elections which brought Slovak nationalists to power in the smaller Slovak republic.
Mr Vladimir Meciar the leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the current Slovak premier then pledged to oust the man who called on voters not to support demagoguery a thinly veiled reference to Mr Meciar s populist campaign.
In the wake of the collapse of communism Slovaks slowly began asserting their identity and increased their calls on the federal authorities in Prague for greater economic and political autonomy.
By removing Mr Havel from office Slovak nationalists vented their frustrations at the man who became the symbol of Prague s inability to respond to their demands.
A moralist who wanted to remain above daily politics he saw his beliefs dashed by the growing antagonism between Czechs and Slovaks.
Limited by a 1968 constitution which gives little power to the presidency he warned well ahead of other politicians of a political development which he was unable to influence and which today threatens to split his country.
There may be another Czechoslovak president as the federal parliament will vote on yet unknown candidates in the next three months.
If he is not replaced by October 5 Mr Havel is due to hand over his powers to the parliament and the federal government.
But the new federal president if there is one might be only a ceremonial figure with little political impact unlike Mr Havel who still enjoys wide popularity in the Czech republic.
FT 24 JUL 92 Czechs and Slovaks take legal road to break up of federation.
CZECH and Slovak leaders will begin drafting a law on the break up of Czechoslovakia after agreeing the formal abolition of the 74 year old state early yesterday.
Meeting for the fifth time since June s elections Mr Vaclav Klaus the Czech prime minister and Mr Vladimir Meciar his Slovak counterpart agreed to propose to the federal parliament by September 30 a law on the federation s abolition and on settling the property and other related issues.
The draft law will offer several alternatives for deciding the country s break up.
These would include an agreement between the two republics parliaments a declaration by the federal assembly or a referendum.
It will offer more flexibility than the current federal constitution which allows a divorce between the two republics to be decided only by a referendum.
Yesterday s agreement emphasised the intention of both sides to ensure a constitutional and orderly break up of the country.
But unilateral steps such as the adoption of a Slovak constitution planned for late August could bring a de facto end to the federation sooner than expected.
Czech and Slovak leaders will remain faced with the difficult task of dividing the assets and liabilities of the federation.
Speaking to bankers in London this week Mr Vladimir Dlouhy the Czech Industry Minister said the Czech republic would be ready to assume the federation s entire Dollars 9.
According to Mr Klaus yesterday s negotiations also focused on the possibility of creating a customs union between the two republics based on free flow of capital labour and goods.
But no agreement was reached on the controversial issue of whether a common currency should be maintained.
It will be subject to further study and discussion Mr Klaus said.
According to an earlier post electoral agreement the two republics will have separate budgets from next January.
Slovakia hopes to pass a full constitution in August.
The Czech republic will follow suit and prepare its own Mr Klaus said on Wednesday.
FT 21 AUG 92 Czechs and Slovaks in agreement over split.
LEADERS of the Czech and Slovak regional parliaments took a further step towards the eventual liquidation of the Czechoslovak republic yesterday when they agreed that both regions would become successor states to the present federation Reuter reports from Prague.
We have agreed to that Mr Milan Uhde chairman of the Czech National Council said after a meeting with his Slovak counterpart Mr Ivan Gasparovic in Prague.
The two leaders discussed the work of commissions of the two assemblies which are drawing up draft proposals for future co operation after the Czechoslovak state is dissolved.
Agreement on the break up of the state has been one of the few points of consensus between the winners of June s general elections in Czechoslovakia the Civic Democratic party (ODS) in the Czech republic and the Slovak Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).
ODS leader Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir Meciar of the HZDS have agreed that both sides should conclude negotiations over the framework of future co operation between the two independent republics by the end of September.
The impending break up of the country is the result of divergent views on the future composition of the 74 year old Czechoslovak republic.
Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar are due to meet in Prague on August 26 to discuss further steps towards the split.
FT 05 OCT 92 Havel insists on a Czech state.
THE FORMER Czechoslovak president Mr Vaclav Havel urged at the weekend that preparations towards an independent Czech state be speeded up following a Slovak about face which dashed plans to dissolve the federal state by the end of the year.
Mr Havel was reacting to the initiative of Mr Vladimir Meciar the Slovak prime minister who with the Czech opposition parties succeeded on Thursday in having the federal parliament adopt a motion to draw up plans for a new union between the Czech and Slovak republics.
This union would link the two republics under a single president heading a government in charge of economic defence foreign social and environmental policies.
The move contradicts all post electoral agreements between Mr Meciar and Mr Vaclav Klaus the Czech prime minister which aimed to dissolve the federal state legally by January 1.
I fear this will lead to prolonged uncertainty Mr Havel said.
The Czech parliament should declare its intention to create an independent Czech state and adopt as soon as possible its own constitution.
Calls for a unilateral secession of the Czech republic from the federal state increased at the weekend among Czech officials angered by the Slovak U turn.
However such a move could only legally be achieved via a popular referendum.
Recent opinion polls show that fewer than half of all Czechs would vote to break up the federal state.
Mr Klaus who had pushed for a break up since Slovak nationalists won power in last June s election is due to meet Mr Meciar tomorrow.
FT 07 OCT 92 Czech and Slovak split back on course.
CZECH AND Slovak political leaders yesterday agreed to continue working toward the division of the Czechoslovak federal state defusing the political crisis brought about by the recent Slovak about face.
After eight hours of negotiations late last night Mr Vaclav Klaus the Czech prime minister and Mr Vladimir Meciar his Slovak counterpart issued a joint statement.
They confirmed earlier agreements which aim to create two independent Czech and Slovak republics by next January 1.
The statement calmed mounting fears that the country was heading toward political paralysis with both Czech and Slovak leaders standing at opposite ends as regards the fate of the federal state.
In a surprise move in the federal parliament last Thursday night Slovak nationalists had succeeded with the support of the Czech opposition parties in pushing through a motion to draw up plans for a new union between the Slovak and Czech republics.
Such a possibility has always been categorically rejected by Mr Klaus.
However Mr Meciar and his party the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) last night went back on its proposal for a union.
The HZDS respects the idea that it is impossible to transform the current federation into a confederation or a union the statement said.
Difficult compromises remain to be reached though over the practical aspects of the divorce.
So far no agreements have appeared over the methods to be used in dividing federal properties.
The Czech side is refusing to accept the financial compensations requested by Slovak negotiators.
East of Maastricht The Czecho Slovak duet is made even more discordant by efforts to stay in tune with the EC.
Mr Vaclav Klaus prime minister of the Czech Republic makes no secret of his admiration for Lady Thatch er the former UK prime minister.
It is not surprising to learn therefore that he is a Euro sceptic who regards the treaty of Maastricht as a nightmare and places more faith in bilateral relations with individual west European countries than in the EC as such.
So at least it is confidently asserted in diplomatic and political circles in Prague.
But Mr Klaus has yet to go public with this view even if he gave a broad hint when asked for his reaction to the French referendum result he said that a very narrow Yes was practically equivalent to a No.
First because Czechs in general and his own Civic Democratic party in particular are determined to return to Europe after the long years of communism which kept them away from what they regard as their natural home in the west.
Second because Mr Klaus himself has espoused a special relationship with Germany as the means to achieve this.
Both considerations make it impolitic to denounce Maastricht unless and until the west Europeans especially the Germans should decide to abandon the project.
Czechs do not wish to be thought of as half hearted or lukewarm Europeans.
Therefore so long as Maastricht is the official EC blueprint for what Europe will look like at the end of the century they feel the need to proclaim that it also defines their long term objectives and that they will be more than happy to accept its constraints.
When it comes to relations with the Slovaks however the Czechs find this argument cuts both ways.
On the one hand they fear that being yoked to the Slovaks may dilute their west European credentials and hold them back in their rush to embrace the capitalist way of life.
On the other hand it is hard to explain why they are opposed to a union or confederation with Slovakia when they claim to be in favour of a pan European union as defined by Maastricht.
Thus Mr Milos Zeman the Czech Social Democrat leading the opposition to the break up of Czechoslovakia made a shrewd move last week when he proposed to transform the present federation into a Czecho Slovak Union on the Maastricht model which would come to an end on the day that the Czech and Slovak republics join the European Union itself.
To Mr Klaus s fury the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly passed a resolution to draw up plans for such a union after his own proposal on the procedure for dissolving the federation agreed with his Slovak counterpart Mr Vladimir Meciar had fallen just short of the required three fifths majority.
The Klaus Meciar proposal was defeated by an alliance between the Czech left and the various opposition parties in Slovakia.
Christian Democrats ex communists and representatives of the Hungarian minority.
But most of Mr Meciar s supporters then switched sides and voted for Mr Zeman s union which sounds very like the confederation formerly proposed by Mr Meciar.
Mr Klaus has consistently rejected the idea of a confederation arguing that no halfway house is possible between the present federation and two fully independent states.
He does accept that the two should form a customs union but rejects any notion of joint institutions or shared sovereignty whether in the field of defence and foreign policy or of economic social and environmental affairs.
Even the single currency he would maintain only for a short transitional period.
Mr Klaus s overriding fear is evidently that the success of his bold free market policies in the Czech Republic would be endangered by the need to subsidise a more protectionist and interventionist Slovak government.
The radical economic strategy he adopted as federal finance minister in 1990 92 coinciding with the loss of cheap energy supplies and captive markets in the former Soviet bloc has had traumatic effects throughout the country.
Czechoslovak industrial output fell by 23 per cent in 1991 and a similar figure is projected for 1992.
Investment hampered by tight credit restrictions and high interest rates was cut in half in 1991 while consumer prices rose more than 50 per cent.
Admittedly this was a low rate of inflation by Russian or even Polish standards and this year it has fallen to less than 1 per cent per month.
But while many individual Czechs have taken to capitalism with gusto and are visibly affluent the incomes of the majority have not caught up with prices.
Thus even in the Czech Republic Mr Klaus s policy is fraught with social risk and political difficulty.
He needs both time and a favourable international climate for it to show dividends.
But Slovakia which had a high concentration of uneconomic heavy industries geared to the Soviet market and lacks the advantage of proximity to Germany is far worse placed to cope with the effects of such policies.
Unemployment especially has risen much more sharply in Slovakia and this has led many Slovaks to see Mr Klaus s policy as an anti Slovak conspiracy against which they need protection.
He promised to secure greater autonomy and to pursue an economic policy more suited to Slovak conditions.
He also offered emotional compensations to a people with an acute inferiority complex.
for 70 years the Slovaks have been alternately taken for granted or talked down to by the Czechs while the rest of the world has ignored them using Czech as an abbreviation for Czechoslovak.
The Slovaks may fairly be accused of wanting the best of both worlds.
the trappings of national sovereignty combined with the security of federation.
They seem likely to end up with an independence more complete and far more uncomfortable than they desired.
Unhappily it may have been President Vaclav Havel who gave Czechoslovakia the coup de grace with the televised address in which he solemnly warned the Slovaks against voting for people with dictatorial tendencies meaning quite clearly Mr Meciar.
This had the opposite of the effect intended drastically reducing his own popularity in Slovakia and boosting Mr Meciar s.
Not surprisingly Mr Meciar and his supporters responded after the election by blocking Mr Havel s re election as federal president.
Mr Havel for his part has not concealed his disillusionment with the Slovaks.
he even lamented publicly that 70 years of Czech efforts to civilise them and bring them to the west had been in vain thus perfectly illustrating the Czech attitude that Slovaks object to.
He is now pinning his hopes on being the first president of the Czech Republic for which he will need Mr Klaus s support.
He no longer insists that a referendum be held before the federation is dissolved.
and at a press conference last Saturday he poured scorn on the proposal for a union.
There was no case in history he said of a federation being replaced by a union.
and added in a curious but revealing non sequitur that Maastricht is really a federation.
Mr Havel is undoubtedly a more genuine enthusiast for European Union than Mr Klaus.
Indeed he proclaimed his belief that the process of European integration would in time bring the Czechs and the Slovaks together again.
Yet in order to toe the line that no halfway house is possible in the Czecho Slovak context he feels obliged to assert that none exists even in the European context.
FT 16 NOV 92 Czechs and Slovaks face the pain of breaking up.
The problems of dividing archives armed forces and buildings.
PITY the unfortunate officials at the Czechoslovak Defence Ministry.
They have been saddled with the task of dividing up as fairly as possible not just the country s armed forces and weapons but also its archives including important records from the second world war and the years of communist rule.
Worse they have to find a solution before the country divides into the republics of the Czech Lands and Slovakia on January 1 1993.
Apart from cutting everything in three and handing two pieces to the Czechs and one to the Slovaks to correspond to the population ratio they simply do not know how to begin dividing such historical material.
As an example of the problem that breaking up can bring the issue of the archives is not entirely trifling.
Slovakia s defence minister Mr Jozef Tuchyna has said that if there is no full agreement on defence between the two republics before January 1 Slovakia may not accept any others.
Defence agriculture and the division of federal property are the three crucial areas on which no consensus has yet been reached.
The federal property issue is proving particularly difficult and is unlikely to be resolved by January 1.
The main problem is that the federal parliament has been unable to muster the necessary three fifths majority to pass a bill authorising the division.
Both the Czech and Slovak national councils have threatened to pass a resolution forcing the parliament to act.
The federal cabinet meanwhile has agreed to set up a special commission of senior officials from both sides headed by the federal prime minister Mr Jan Strasky to get things moving.
Property will essentially be divided territorially and in proportion to population with special measures to compensate either republic in instances where most of the property of a federal institution is located in the other.
Not only are most government buildings for example in Prague the Czech capital but the Czechs also have most of the federal defence installations though the armaments industry is in Slovakia.
Despite these difficulties however progress has been made in other areas.
To date 22 agreements governing future relations between the Czech republic and Slovakia have been signed by the republics prime ministers Mr Vaclav Klaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar.
The most important is a customs union due to come into force on January 1 which provides for abolition of all trade restrictions between the two republics a single customs territory and common tariffs on trade with third countries.
Both sides have also agreed to continue with a single currency the koruna for up to six months after the split.
These achievements reflect areas with a broad element of consensus.
Western diplomats praise the businesslike manner adopted by both sides.
However one senior diplomat pointed out the importance of reaching some kind of definitive arrangement on the issue of federal property by the deadline otherwise it will drag on for years and will no longer be a priority.
This point was underlined this week by Mr Vladimir Dlouhy Czech republic trade and industry minister.
Returning from a trade mission to Italy he said the vagueness surrounding the split had affected business confidence in Czechoslovakia and politicians must spell out more clearly what has been achieved so far.
FT 18 NOV 92 Czechs and Slovaks vote on final split.
THE FINAL constitutional hurdle in the way of the smooth dissolution of the Czechoslovak federation was cleared yesterday.
The Czech and Slovak republican parliaments passed a joint resolution authorising the split into two independent republics from next January 1.
The passing of the resolution ends months of wrangling and uncertainty over how the federation should be dissolved with a majority of deputies in the federal parliament holding out for a referendum on the division of the federal state.
Yesterday s resolution is expected to be endorsed by the federal parliament however thus ruling out a referendum.
The resolution was passed by 106 67 in the Czech parliament and by 73 16 in the Slovak parliament.
Also yesterday Mr Vaclav Havel Czechoslovakia s former president confirmed that he would be a candidate for the post of president of the Czech republic after January 1.
I am aware of my responsibility for the political situation in this country and I want to influence it he said.
According to an opinion poll published earlier this month 57 per cent of Czechs would like Mr Havel to become their president after the split.
The next most popular politician Mr Vaclav Klaus prime minister polled only 5 per cent.
Mr Havel has so far said that he favours a direct presidential election in the Czech republic but members of the ruling Czech coalition have expressed their support for a parliamentary vote which could take place next spring.
The Czech parliament is currently discussing a draft constitution for the republic which would limit the presidential powers making the post largely ceremonial.
The Czechoslovak federal assembly yesterday passed a law authorising the constitutional dissolution of the federal state.
The vote ensures the legal break up of the 74 year old federation passing legislative powers to the Czech and Slovak republics Vincent Boland reports from Prague.
As Czechs and Slovaks separate their two states will be hard pressed to maintain their identities.
It all began with a war of words over a hyphen recalls Rudolf Filkus who will be Bratislava s first ambassador to Austria when the Czech Republic and Slovakia go their separate ways on Friday.
He was referring to the bitter debate over the name of post communist Czechoslovakia which followed the brief euphoria of the Velvet Revolution three years ago.
Czechs from the historic provinces of Bohemia and Moravia who make up two thirds of the dying federation s 15.
6m population thought it would be sufficient to drop the word socialist from the official title of the federal state and add a hyphen to create a simple Federal Republic of Czecho Slovakia.
Months of anguished debate later the hyphen idea was dropped and both sides finally approved a renamed Federal Republic of Czechs and Slovaks.
By then however no one could ignore the depth or at least the decibel level of Slovak resentment.
It is the bitter fruit of centuries of subservience to powerful Hungarians under the Habsburg empire only to be followed by seven decades of playing second fiddle as junior partner to the more populous richer ethnically closer but condescending Czechs.
It took the emergence of a stocky former boxer with a communist past to channel Slovak resentments into a nationalist movement the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which promised to make Slovaks master in their own house and respected abroad.
For Mr Vladimir Meciar the HZDS leader victory in last June s general election was seen as a mandate to negotiate a new and more equal relationship with the Czechs and to pay off old scores against Czechoslovakia s morally superior federal president the playwright Vaclav Havel.
But the general election which elevated Mr Meciar in Slovakia confirmed a very different kind of politician as leader of the neighbouring Czech lands.
Many Slovaks identify Mr Meciar as the personification of Janosik the rustic hero of Slovak folk history.
But no one could confuse Mr Vaclav Klaus the spiky punctilious economist who won the Czech elections with Good Soldier Sveik the obstinately dim witted but good natured scourge of Habsburg officialdom in whom many Czechs see aspects of themselves.
Over the past six months these two men have sealed the fate of Czechoslovakia.
With legalistic precision they and a handful of senior officials have worked out highly detailed divorce papers on 26 complex subjects ranging from the division of the federal army to apportioning the foreign debt.
They have also agreed to maintain a customs union and the free movement of goods and people after independence.
The two states will also have separate central banks and ultimately separate currencies after a probably brief initial period with a common currency.
Within months possibly weeks the old Czechoslovak crown will be split into Slovak and Czech crowns.
They will begin life with equal value but most observers expect a substantial devaluation of the Slovak crown within a few months.
The general principle followed in these talks has been a division of assets and liabilities on a 2.
Both sides appear proud of the unprecedentedly civilised manner of their divorce arrangements and both leaders have expressed nothing but mutual respect and esteem in public.
There is a nagging feeling however especially in Slovakia that the wily Mr Klaus caught the former Slovak pugilist off balance at their first meeting and retained the psychological advantage through subsequent sparring rounds.
From the start Mr Klaus made clear that the Czechs had no intention of bankrolling Slovak independence and would consider only a strengthened federation or a split.
Better a quick divorce than a messy marriage was the uncompromising message that Mr Meciar brought back from his first talks with Mr Klaus.
There was never any suggestion that Prague would emulate Belgrade which 18 months ago sent federal troops into Slovenia in a half hearted attempt to keep the small republic within the now defunct Yugoslav federation.
Economically there is little question that Slovakia s best hope for a prosperous future lay in remaining firmly attached to the powerful Czech locomotive.
A glance at the map of central Europe explains why.
Prague is 200km west of Vienna and the Czech lands were the most industrialised part of the Habsburg empire.
Between the wars Czech industry was as technically proficient as Germany s.
After the divorce the Czech republic will be firmly anchored in western Europe while Slovakia will retain only a narrow border with Austria and be hemmed in by Poland the Ukraine and Hungary.
The danger is that both halves of the soon to be divided federal state will be hard pressed to maintain their future identities.
So linked is the new Czech state with the German speaking core of Europe that some Czech wits suggest that their new state should be called East Germany.
Mr Klaus Kinkel the German foreign minister was reportedly not amused when a Czech journalist shared the joke with him at a recent Czech German summit meeting.
The spiritual fathers of the Czechoslovak state mainly Czech and Slovak emigres in Pittsburgh and other American industrial towns during the first world war sold the idea of the new dual nation to President Woodrow Wilson as a Slav bulwark to reduce German influence in postwar Europe.
Now the Czech republic risks ending up as little more than an extension to the German economy.
Northern Bohemia with its busy industrial towns like Teplice even looks like Germany with solid round turreted houses and sturdy factories.
Until 1945 this area was the German speaking Sudetenland whose 3m inhabitants were used by Hitler in 1938 to justify the first partition of prewar Czechoslovakia which when ratified by the infamous Munich Agreement sealed Czechoslovakia s fate for 50 years.
While the new Czech republic will be surrounded by prosperous Germanic Europe and working full out to fulfil the rising demand for cheap industrial goods produced by Bohemian workers at wages roughly 10 per cent of German levels Slovakia where unemployment at 12 per cent is already four times the Czech level will become Europe s new frontier with the east.
Nowhere is this uncomfortable reality clearer than at the Russian market on the outskirts of Kosice the principal city of eastern Slovakia.
Here on a frozen muddy field thousands of Ukrainian Russian and Vietnamese stand in the bitter wind to display their pathetic wares grubby underpants rusty deodorant spray cans used car parts plastic flowers cheap homemade alcohol.
Groups of Slav imitation Rambos indicate where for the equivalent of a few dollars pistols Kalashnikov rifles and ammunition are for sale.
The vulnerability of Slovakia to economic and political instability in the countries to its south and east can also be clearly seen at the east Slovakian Steel Works (VSZ) which is the main employer in Kosice and the surrounding area.
The Czech built plant s output of cheap high quality sheet steel has already attracted anti dumping measures from the European Community.
Now its entire output is threatened by a shortage of Russian supplied fuel in Ukraine.
VSZ depends on a regular supply of enriched iron pellets from Krivoi Rog in south eastern Ukraine and Russian gas supplied by pipeline under Ukrainian soil.
Now Krivoi Rog is short of diesel fuel and VSZ is having to send a fleet of diesel tankers on a 2 000km round trip shuttle service to the Ukrainian city so that trucks can load railwagons with pellets for VSZ.
Without these pellets much of the downstream manufacturing capacity of Slovakia would be crippled including the big tank and arms factories.
These were hobbled by the federal government s virtual ban on arms exports but have been given approval by Mr Meciar to compete for a 300 tank order from Pakistan and other potential deals in Africa and the Middle East.
Kosice with large Hungarian Ruthenian and Ukraine minorities is a city which has traditionally looked to Prague to counterbalance what it sees as the dangerous centralising tendencies of Bratislava and retain links with western Europe.
Mr Dusan Klinger publisher and chief editor of Slovensky Vychod the principal local newspaper in Eastern Slovakia was a dissident during the Communist regime.
He articulates the fears of many Kosice intellectuals that with independence severing these old ties democracy freedom of speech and prosperity will slip away from a region which voted heavily for Mr Meciar s opponents at the elections.
But the approach of independence is also being greeted nervously in the Slovak capital which with its complement of newly refurbished foreign embassies government buildings and parliament should be the main gainer from Slovakia s new sovereign status.
Bratislava s baroque old town dominated by its austere square castle overlooking the River Danube is less than 70km from Vienna and will soon be connected by improved road and rail links.
Until now Slovakia has attracted less than 10 per cent of the Dollars 1bn which has flowed into Czechoslovakia since 1990 and Volkswagen s new Audi station wagon assembly plant in the industrial suburbs is the main single foreign investment.
But joint ventures with Austrian companies are the most numerous and Mr Meciar s team hopes to build a Mexican style industrial free port close to the Austrian border to attract inward investment.
The hope is that future links with Vienna will prove more fruitful than the long and subservient connection with Budapest.
But it is hard to escape the conclusion that Slovakia with more than 600 000 ethnic Hungarians will need to build friendly relations with Hungary with whom it has been in a bitter dispute over the Gabcikovo dam on the Danube river as well as with the Czech republic itself.
Just before Christmas Poland Hungary and representatives of the future Czech and Slovak republics signed a free trade agreement linking the Visegrad 4.
This is the grouping named after the Hungarian town where two years ago the central European countries agreed to co ordinate their eventual entry into the EC.
Many Czechs and Slovaks hope that full membership of an enlarged EC by 2000 will allow both states to come back together still as sovereign countries but within the over arching compass of a wider EC whose eventual contours still have to be defined.
FT 02 JAN 93 Czechs and Slovaks vow to keep split amiable.
Prime ministers of both states shy away from predicting the exact course of future dealings.
MR Vladimir Meciar the first prime minister of newly independent Slovakia appealed yesterday to Slovaks of all ethnic origins to rally behind the new country and build a legal democratic and decentralised state.
In a televised address to the nation from the capital Bratislava he called on all Slovaks and Hungarian Czech Polish Ukrainian Ruthenian and Romany (gypsy) minorities all the citizens of the Slovak Republic to work together.
In Prague now the capital of the independent Czech Republic Mr Vaclav Klaus the prime minister pledged to maintain close ties with Slovakia formerly the junior partner in the 74 year old federal Czechoslovak state which was formally dissolved at midnight on December 31.
Mr Klaus said in a speech to political and religious leaders in Prague castle that there would be no Chinese wall along the common frontier.
He underlined that Slovakia s economic prosperity and the maintenance of political pluralism was also a political concern for the Czech Republic.
Mr Meciar acknowledged in a speech which implicitly recognised the fears and reservations that many Slovaks harbour about the ending of the link with the more prosperous Czech Republic that difficulties lay ahead for the smaller of the two new states.
He assured Slovaks that links with the Czech Republic would continue to be close and that Slovakia needed neither customs officers nor border crossings and other restrictions.
Both leaders underlined the difficulty of predicting the exact course of their future relationship.
Mr Meciar pledged to honour all obligations assumed during the six months the two states moved apart and to co operate at the highest possible level.
He and other leading Slovaks attended independence celebrations in Bratislava s central square which began with the hoisting of the new flag and the singing of the national anthem.
Thousands of people turned out to usher in both the new year and the new state.
Kiss me I m Slovak one of the throng caught the mood of the night.
She said it was a special moment for all Slovaks as people queued to smother her with kisses.
Then to the strains of The Blue Danube the singing and dancing continued into the night.
In his speech the Slovak leader stressed the importance of relations with Austria and underlined Slovakia s permanent and sincere interest in good relations with Hungary.
In a reference to the economic difficulties facing Slovakia whose heavy and arms related industries were built largely to serve the former Soviet and Comecon markets he warned there was a lot to learn.
Mr Meciar a former communist said it was necessary to draw a thick line between the present and the past.
While the velvet revolution of November 1989 had rejected a system that was bad we cannot reject the work of those who worked honestly under this bad system an indication that he will not permit a clean break with communist style methods favoured by the free market orientated Czech government.
How history kills in Bunkum an der Oder James Morgan studies rhetorical lessons of the past.
HISTORY said Henry Ford is bunk and there is a sense in which he was right.
He was not foolish enough to be a member of the End of history school of nonsense which emerged a few of years ago just in time for history to collapse on it like a tidal wave gushing from an ancient sewer.
When Ford talked of bunk he was using the familiar abbreviation of the word bunkum.
That in turn comes from Buncombe a county in North Carolina.
Its congressional representative in 1820 Felix Walker spoke at length because Buncombe expected it of him.
So bunkum is a mixture of anecdote tall stories and claptrap and as such provides the main constituent of what passes for political debate over much of Europe today.
The representatives of the Buncombe school of history are having the time of their lives and unlike Congressman Walker are able to influence events.
The Czecho Slovak divorce resulted from the overblown rhetoric of Slovak politicians.
They played on the popular feeling that Slovaks had been done out of their rights by the more numerous and domineering Czechs.
This merely ensured that they were full participants in the revival of that ancient Euro game of finding someone to resent.
And so of course they fell into the trap laid for them by the crafty Czech prime minister Vaclav Klaus.
When the split came the Bratislava papers were still trying to define what it meant to be Slovak while their headlines proclaimed the establishment of the frontier with Moravia implying that the Czech Republic would itself break up into its constituents Bohemia Moravia and Silesia.
In fact the determination of the Slovaks to believe that their neighbour will fall apart would be pathetic were it not for the malign assistance of the European Community.
By placing strict quotas on exports of the products of the north Moravian steel industry it has given a boost to local separatists.
Thus there is a revival of that theme of the 1930s when the newspapers of the Third Reich called Czechoslovakia the Mosaic state.
Then after the creation of independent Slovakia in 1938 Hungary took over the bit inhabited by its people and so today the lifeblood of the Budapest press has become stories of the hardships facing the Hungarians of Slovakia our Upper Land in Magyar.
Hungarian nostalgia for the Austro Hungarian empire is a natural result.
During the Yugoslav conference in London last August one unreported element was the way that every national minority the Balkans arrived in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre to have its say.
The Macedonian and the Montenegrin Albanians both began their press conferences with the dread words In 1878.
That reference unleashed a litany of grievances that left the audience of mainly west European reporters baffled and bored.
One inflamed Albanian was asked if his was the largest minority in wherever it was that it was a minority.
They are however subjected to the catalyst of paranoia that has already led to the construction of Buncombe cum Serbia whose present deplorable conduct is founded on a bizarre mixture of fact fantasy and epic distortion.
So it is that we have become familiar with Bunkum an der Oder as old East German communist youth leaders easily transform themselves into neo Nazi rabble rousers.
In Baincombes sur Aube politicians tell peasants that they have an absolute right to sell everything that they produce at no matter what cost because it is historic destiny and glorious vocation of la France profonde etcetera etcetera.
And in the bars of the south Antrim village of Ballybunkum either tears are shed or glasses raised in memory of the events of the late 17th century.
In England fortunately history has been theme parked into trivia.
In the Neighbours bar of the the Polystyrene Arms the villagers of Buncombe St Michael consume their microwaved chicken tandoori in a basket suck mouthfuls of Mexican lager through little bits of yellowing lime and argue whether they can really be at the heart of a European Community which threatens the future of prawn cocktail flavoured crisps.
This provides a haven from the historical correctness which has become the prevailing philosophy of east and central Europe.
Since reunification the German media have more than ever taken to using the old German names for Polish towns and cities.
Nothing wrong with that perhaps the English would never say Roma but in middle Europe these things sound different.
Last week however German sports editors faced a nasty problem.
The Polish team which qualified for the European ice hockey championships in Dusseldorf called Unia Oswiecim.
At the Yugoslav meeting last August the prime minister of the rump state and loser in the recent Serbian elections Milan Panic spoke at length of the damage wrought by historical obsessions in his part of the world and made a valuable suggestion.
Henry Ford may have been mistaken but he was not talking bunk.
James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.
Ready to go it alone After the velvet divorce from Slovakia the new republic is preparing to reform its economy restructure its industry and modernise its infrastructure.
THE CZECHS were always the most westerly of the Slav nations of Europe but for nearly 50 years their incorporation into the Soviet empire turned them reluctantly towards the east.
The collapse of communism and the divorce from Slovakia on January 1 have unshackled their drive to integrate into the hitherto exclusively western European Community as soon as possible.
Czech and Slovak negotiators managed to dissolve the Czechoslovak federal state in an orderly peaceful fashion without the violent ethnic conflicts which have accompanied the collapse of Yugoslavia.
But the speed with which the former common currency split and their formerly integrated economies started to diverge after the divorce bears witness to the strength of the forces now likely to widen their differences after 74 years of cohabitation.
Without Czech subsidies and free access to the Czech market Slovakia faces a period of economic and political stress which will require sympathetic handling not only by Prague but also by western governments including the US.
At least that is the message which senior Czech politicians left with the Clinton administration during a recent visit to Washington.
3m Czechs in the new republic admit to a sense of relief that they are no longer responsible for what happens in Slovakia.
But this is tinged with concern that Prague along with ethnic minorities such as Hungarians and gypsies may be among the scapegoats who will be blamed if independence does not bring the promised prosperity to independent Slovakia.
Those Slovaks who opposed the nationalist fervour whipped up before last June s elections and wanted to keep a modified federal relationship with Prague are now being joined by others who feel resentful that in the words of a senior Slovak diplomat Slovakia has been dumped by the Czechs.
In the short run the diminution in trade between the two republics will act as a drag on growth in both republics rather as the collapse of Comecon and the Warsaw Pact deepened the recession which accompanied the shift to market orientated reforms throughout central Europe.
The expectation in Prague however is that the increasingly privatised Czech economy will respond by building up already growing markets in the European Community especially Germany which surrounds the Czech Republic on two flanks and with Austria.
Such re orientation will be much more difficult for Slovakia which is saddled with a less flexible industrial base.
Even before the split the Czech Republic attracted around 90 per cent of the foreign investment flowing into the old federation.
The republic s medieval and baroque cities ski resorts and spas also earned the lion s share of tourist revenue a crucial factor keeping the Czech balance of payments in the black.
Last year the Czech Republic earned Dollars 1.
2bn officially from tourism and at least another Dollars 500m in unrecorded tourist payments.
This was roughly equivalent to the foreign capital inflow although total foreign investment including the transfer of plant and equipment was considerably higher.
German companies in particular attracted by a skilled labour force at around 10 per cent of German wage rates have been closing their German plants and transporting equipment together with a handful of key personnel to new sites in the Czech republic mainly just across the border in Bohemia the most westerly part of the country.
Stripped to essentials the combination of low wages and high skills is the main Czech draw card.
But wages rose 22 per cent between the first and third quarters of 1992 according to labour ministry figures reflecting the rising demand especially for skilled workers from foreign companies and the fast growing private sector.
Foreign investors are often impressed by the skills and willingness to learn of their Czech employees.
But three waves of emigration 50 years of totalitarian rule and the attempted destruction of bourgeois traditions by successive communist governments have left their mark on the older generation s willingness to accept responsibility and take decisions.
As elsewhere in the region decades of communist party rule also reduced the quality and effectiveness of local and state administration a problem which has been exacerbated by the loss of key personnel to the higher paying private sector.
The lack of an efficient administration has increased the burden on ministers and a handful of senior officials.
It has also contributed for example to long delays in finalising some large foreign investment privatisations such as the planned investment by Siemens of Germany in the Skoda Pilsen engineering group and the revised joint venture plans of Mercedes Benz for the Avia truck company.
Years of low investment or at least low innovation have also run down the former Czech industrial power house and left a legacy of often run down giant plants built to supply standardised products for Soviet bloc markets which can no longer pay for them.
The country faces a massive programme of industrial restructuring and infrastructure development including crucial areas for foreign investment such as telecommunications and modernisation of the banking system.
The centre right coalition government headed by Mr Vaclav Klaus which emerged after the elections is committed to retaining the historical role of the Czech lands (Bohemia Moravia and Silesia) as one of the most highly industrialised areas of Europe.
To ensure the rapid transformation of industry towards new markets and products it has sponsored the most extensive mass privatisation programme in central Europe and encouraged foreign investment with new laws and institutions modelled on EC practice.
Modernisation involves high costs and complex issues.
The communist imposed concentration on heavy industry for example has turned some of the oldest industrial towns into ecological disaster areas.
The worst pollution is to be found among the string of industrial and mining towns in northern Bohemia and Moravia fuelled by a chain of coal burning power stations.
Their smokestacks continue to spew out poisons which have led to infant mortality levels generally found in the third world and to shortened life spans.
The chemical laden smoke has destroyed nearby forests and contributed to the acid rain which has killed life in lakes as far away as Scandinavia.
Faced with this reality the government has opted to complete a 2 000MW Soviet designed nuclear power station at Temelin in southern Bohemia the construction of which was first ordered in 1977.
It will be equipped with fuel rods and safety equipment from Westinghouse of the US and will employ western contractors to ensure the complex complies with the highest safety standards when it comes on stream in the second half of the decade.
Once on stream the aim is to phase out the worst polluting coal fired stations in the north and equip the remainder with expensive anti pollution scrubbers.
But like so many of the hard choices facing resource starved governments throughout the region the nuclear option has been attacked by a vociferous anti nuclear lobby as another example of government arrogance while coal miners facing closure of pits have joined steelworkers and others facing unemployment in anti government protests.
For all the problems facing the new state however few would return to the stultifying atmosphere of the communist era with its humiliating insistence on outward conformity in exchange for a quiet life.
Like millions of other involuntary members of the Soviet empire Czechs lived without perspective or hope for change.
Over the past three years stagnation has been replaced by tumultuous change in all directions.
Since January 1 Czechs have regained the independence they first lost 370 years ago.
FT 12 AUG 93 Slovaks apply to relinquish citizenship.
AN ESTIMATED 100 000 ethnic Slovaks most of them living in the Czech Republic have applied to relinquish their citizenship since Czechoslovakia broke into separate states a Slovak official said yesterday Reuter reports from Bratislava.
Some 500 a day applied last month she said but the figure was now falling.
Under Czech regulations Slovaks with two years residence in the Czech Republic have until the end of this year to trade in their Slovak passports for Czech ones a swap that requires formally giving up their Slovak nationality.
Only a few hundred Czechs have applied for Slovak citizenship.
The Czech Republic has one of Europe s lowest unemployment rates 2.
Slovakia in contrast has slid further into decline since partition.
An amicable divorce Anthony Robinson traces the tortuous road to Slovak independence.
SLOVAKIA may be a state without a history but the grounds for its divorce from the Czech republic have deep historical roots.
The disintegration of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia mark in their very different ways the liquidation of the last multi ethnic compromises to survive the collapse of the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires 75 years ago.
In former Yugoslavia the principle of ethnic purity absurd and tragic given centuries of intermarriage is being pursued to its bloody end through the mass transfer of people accompanied by systematic rape and pillage.
The emergence of separate Czech and Slovak states by contrast came about through a negotiated divorce and legal division of state property.
The underlying historical and cultural differences between the Czech and Slovak peoples are almost as great or as small as those between Serbs and Croats.
The contrast is due principally to the total absence in the Czech and Slovak case of any tradition of violent conflict between two ethnically and linguistically linked peoples.
The re emergence of Serbia has revived memories of the medieval Serb kingdom subjugated by the Ottomans 500 years ago while the rebirth of the Czech republic has restored in essence the Kingdom of Bohemia.
The latter was assimilated into the Hapsburg Empire after the fateful battle of the White Mountain near Prague in 1618 at the outset of the Thirty Years War.
Slovakia and Croatia by contrast were both junior partners in their former federations and share a long history of domination by Hungary.
While Croatia enjoyed periods of semi independence however Slovakia was never a sovereign state except as a Nazi puppet during world war two.
Slovakia including its former large Jewish and gypsy minorities and smaller Ruthenian Saxon Ukrainian and other populations remained under Hungarian domination for almost a millennium.
Much of the sometimes almost hysterical tone of Slovak Hungarian relations is inexplicable without reference to this past relationship.
The Slovak leaders who took their country into the first Czechoslovak republic after the first world war did so because they felt too weak to survive on their own.
Even in 1919 they wanted Czechoslovakia to be a federal state in which Slovakia would have enjoyed considerable autonomy.
Only reluctantly did they accept the unitary state insisted on by Jan Masaryk and the Czech fathers of the republic rather than risk a return to Hungarian rule.
In contrast with the 19th century when millions of Slovaks had emigrated to America or sought work as masons and builders elsewhere in Europe the inter war years of this century enabled Slovaks to strengthen their economy and build up cultural and educational standards with assistance from Prague.
The Slovak search for recognition and cultural awareness took systematic form in 1863 with the creation of Matica Slovenska the Slovak cultural foundation.
But Slovaks found their nightmares come true in 1939 as Hungarian power moved back into eastern and southern Slovakia following Hitler s rape of Czechoslovakia.
Even Kosice the second biggest city in Slovakia passed back under the control of Hungary s crypto fascist regime while nominal autonomy over the rump of Slovakia was given to a clerico fascist regime led by Father Jozef Tiso.
The spectacle of Hungary s Admiral Miklos Horthy riding on a white horse in triumph through the streets of Kosice cheered on by its ethnic Hungarians is still remembered by older residents and recounted to their children.
More than 60 000 Slovak Jews were deported to concentration camps along with unknown thousands of gypsies during the Tiso regime.
Those who lived in the Hungarian occupied regions met the same fate in 1944 after Hitler seized power from Admiral Horthy and imposed direct rule on his former ally.
As Soviet forces advanced from the east a sometimes bloody settling of scores took place.
Thousands of ethnic Hungarians were deported from eastern and southern Slovakia mirroring the expulsion of 3m ethnic Germans from the Czech Sudetenland.
During the war the Nazis built up Slovakia as a powerful centre of arms production.
Central Slovakia in particular was out of range for allied bombers but conveniently close to the Russian front.
As the Cold War developed and Stalin tightened his hold on Czechoslovakia after the Prague Coup of February 1948 the tightly centralised communist regime continued to invest heavily in big arms factories.
In the 1960s the the East Slovakian Steel Works (VSZ) was built outside Kosice by Czech engineers with Czech equipment.
The completed plant used iron ore transported over 1 000kms from Krivoi Rog in Ukraine.
Its steel was needed for the arms industry and the other heavy engineering plants set up in what was still a largely rural country before the war.
The close integration of the Slovak economy with the Soviet military machine and the Comecon market was reinforced by construction of the Slovnaft oil refinery at Bratislava the main terminal of the Druzhba oil export pipeline.
Moscow s refusal to risk losing its strategic control lay behind the crushing of the Prague spring in 1968 and the humiliating removal from power of Alexander Dubcek the Slovak communist who endeared himself to Czechs and Slovaks alike by his espousal of socialism with a human face.
Vladimir Meciar the current prime minister was among those purged from the communist party in 1969 as the Slovak apparatchik Gustav Husak was appointed by Moscow to normalise Czechoslovakia and create a phoney federal state which gave greater autonomy but only on paper to Slovakia.
After 20 years of normalisation the loose anti communist coalition calling itself People against Violence celebrated the victory of the velvet revolution in Bratislava as its Czech counterpart the Civic Forum spearheaded by the writer Vaclav Havel celebrated the downfall of communism in the streets of Prague.
The superficial unity of both coalitions soon broke apart however accompanied by a bitter dispute over the economic impact in Slovakia of decisions made by high minded politicians in Prague and over the name to be given the newly democratic Czechoslovak state.
Was it enough as most Czechs argued to call the new state the Czecho Slovak Federal Republic or was it to be called the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.
Behind the war of words nationalist and separatist emotions were whipped up by new politicians in both countries who sought new ways to identify themselves and their movements or parties.
Czechs voted for rapid market reforms and integration into Europe under the leadership of Vaclav Klaus while Vladimir Meciar s ill defined nationalist populist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the avowedly separatist Slovak National Party won the elections in Slovakia.
Since that date the two nations have moved rapidly apart.
After six months of detailed top level negotiations between the Czech and Slovak leaders and their closest advisers the two nations formally divorced on January 1 1993.
Slovakia gained its sovereignty and independence under Mr Meciar whose espousal of Slovak nationalism only really took off in 1991 after he was removed as premier of the first elected post communist government.
Six weeks into independence the political divorce was followed by the division of the former common currency into separate Czech and Slovak crowns.
Six months later the once invisible border was clearly demarcated institutionalised and patrolled by armed border guards.
Suddenly and unintentionally Slovakia found itself on the wrong side of what has become in effect an East West border thanks to a deal worked out by Bonn with its immediate neighbours the Czech republic and Poland to help implement Germany s tougher new asylum laws.
It has been a rough start for the new Republic made worse by a collapse in bilateral trade with the Czech republic rising unemployment and recession in western markets.
But aware that there is no turning back Slovaks have to press ahead with building their new state into a viable member of a future enlarged European Community.
Odd man out with a will of steel Profile of Vladimir Meciar Pioneered Slovak statehood now he must make it work.
VLADIMIR MECIAR will take his place in the history books as the man who led Slovaks to independent statehood.
But 11 months after jubilant crowds ushered in the Slovak republic the stocky 51 year old Prime Minister s opinion poll rating is languishing as doubts accumulate over his ability to lead this nation of 5.
Last month in an ornate gilded room in the former Archbishop s palace which now functions as the seat of government Mr Meciar parried questions about his ability to retain loyal support and political allies his attitude to ethnic minorities and more powerful neighbours his prospects for the economy and his vision of Slovakia s future.
On the hustings he jabs the air with his finger cracks jokes and extracts belly laughs from the crowd.
In private he is extraordinarily immobile big but not tall with a strong handshake and expressionless face in which only his eyes seem to move.
During 90 minutes of conversation there were no flashes of inspiration no vivid phrases no clear vision of the future Slovakia.
guarantee the security of the state and ensure integration with the European Community.
Slovakia he adds is in transition from one system to another in the midst of a dangerous river and moving from one bank to another.
It might take five years to get to the other side he adds.
Buoyed up by the strong showing of the former communist era parties in the recent Polish elections the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) led by the youthful Mr Peter Weiss is pressing for early general elections and hoping to administer the coup de grace to the current prime minister and his demoralised HZDS.
If there are to be elections I will decide the timing and the results will not turn out as my opponents think.
The HZDS is a pragmatic non ideological party of the centre.
It is true we are under attack from left and right but we are a stabilising factor in Slovak politics.
At the last election my opponents accused me of being an StB and a KGB agent and a rapist of small children but my party went on to become the largest party with 38 per cent of the vote and we formed the government not them.
His reply revealed the kind of steely will to power which his various political opponents have underestimated at their peril before.
Mr Meciar has shown in the past that he is never more dangerous than when his back is against the wall.
A former close political aide describes him as a genius at outmanoeuvering his rivals a player without rules who cannot tolerate peers and is driven by his complex personality into a confrontational approach both at home and abroad.
Appointed as premier of the Slovak part of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic after the June 1990 elections he was deposed nine months later when he lost a vote of confidence in the Slovak parliament.
Behind the vote lay dislike of his authoritarian ways among the liberal and Christian Democratic members of Slovakia s People against Violence the anti communist equivalent to the Czech Civic Forum and disquiet in Prague at the increasingly separatist tone of his pronouncements.
Deprived of power Mr Meciar became an implacable foe of the new government led by Mr Jan Carnogursky and whipped up growing popular resentment against both the morally superior attitudes displayed by the federal President Mr Vaclav Havel and the Bratislava government which he portrayed as unable to stand up for Slovak economic and political interests.
As unemployment in the Slovak arms factories and other big plants dependent on Comecon trade soared to four times the Czech level the tireless Meciar barnstormed the country whipping up nationalist fervour and promising to raise Slovakia s status in the world complete the controversial Gabcikovo dam project on the River Danube and improve the economic and moral wellbeing of its people.
Portraying himself as a martyr sacrificed on the altar of Czech arrogance and Slovak government weakness the one time boxer and largely self educated enterprise lawyer reached a peak of popularity at the general elections of June 1992 after addressing packed crowds in pre electoral meetings.
After his first post election meeting with Mr Vaclav Klaus the victor in the Czech elections of the same date it became clear that the self assured fanatically pro market Czech leader preferred a quick divorce from Slovakia to endless recriminations and a loose confederal arrangement which would have left the Czech republic footing much of the bill for Slovakia s greater internal autonomy and higher profile abroad.
Whatever his private thoughts Mr Klaus has taken care never to criticise his Slovak counterpart in personal terms and makes it understood that whatever his reservations he fears that whoever comes after Mr Meciar could well be worse.
Mr Klaus who has a Slovak wife and campaigned for Slovak votes during the 1992 election campaign recognised that Mr Meciar faced a harder task with far fewer resources in building his new state.
The Slovak leader acknowledges that founding the new state brought many problems.
The Czechs started preparing the technical basis for the divorce in January 1991 but Slovakia only began from July 1992 While the Czechs inherited the federal institutions there were no equivalents to these Prague based institutions in Slovakia.
At the same time the divorce left the new Slovak state with a legacy of over sized arms heavy engineering and consumer goods factories orientated towards the defunct Comecon market.
Since January he points out the government has gained international recognition joined a raft of international institutions including the IMF World Bank and EBRD set up a new independent central bank created a separate national currency and forged a national army.
But after recounting the achievements of the last few months Mr Meciar complained that all this had been done against the background of what he described as a campaign of hatred against Slovakia and a wave of hostile propaganda which assaulted Slovakia and its official representatives.
When questioned about Slovakia s image however Slovak diplomats ruefully concede that in many cases the problem has been created by Mr Meciar s own abrasive style.
The issues which have provoked most international criticism include the unilateral decision to go ahead with completion of the Gabcikovo dam despite Hungarian objections and insensitivity to the human and other rights of ethnic Hungarian and gypsy minorities.
They cry out for quiet diplomacy and a search for reasonable compromise.
But subtle diplomacy and a desire for compromise are not easily associated with Mr Meciar s confrontational approach to political problems.
Like most of the grey men in his cabinet and Mrs Anna Nagyova his blonde special adviser on international as well as domestic issues Mr Meciar speaks no foreign languages apart from the closely related Czech and a smattering of Russian.
But he insists on representing Slovakia abroad whenever possible.
In an international setting he always looks the odd one out even among a gathering of fellow leaders from post communist Europe.
At this year s annual international get together in Davos Slovak diplomats watched in despair as the Mr Meciar and his group sat talking among themselves in Slovak as other leaders split into ever changing informal groups exchanging gossip and building informal ties.
At a recent summit meeting in Budapest of the Central European Initiative the 10 nation grouping which includes Italy and Austria as well as eight central European states the Slovak leader fiddled constantly with a recalcitrant translation machine as Mr Klaus the Czech leader replied to questions in fluentGerman and English.
On his return from Budapest Mr Meciar announced his intention to obtain new fighter aircraft from Russia to counter balance similar purchases by Hungary raising the prospect of a mini arms race between states with ethnic minorities on both sides of the border.
Mr Meciar does not compare well with the founders of the original Czechoslovak state.
Having led the move to independence he seems to lack the human and political skills needed to inspire Slovak citizens of all ethnic groups to make the best of their difficult inheritance.
What is more having won independence he seems to underate the importance of building bridges in this potentially dangerous region for a small country with suspicious neighbours.
THE victory in Poland of leftwing political parties with communist roots only four years after the collapse of communism throughout eastern Europe is leading to a reappraisal of political probabilities throughout the former communist world writes Anthony Robinson.
The Polish left s turnabout has aroused particular interest in Slovakia Poland s southern neighbour where the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) led by Mr Peter Weiss closely resembles Poland s Democratic Left Alliance guided by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski.
In Poland the election results were as much a defeat for the fragmented anti communist parties of the Solidarity era opposition as a victory for the re packaged communist era politicians.
There are similarities in Slovakia where the centre stage is tenuously held by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).
This movement a loose alliance bound together more by the personality of Mr Vladimir Meciar than any ideological cement was formed in 1991 after the disintegration of Slovakia s velvet revolution alliance called People Against Violence (VPN).
To its left the HZDS is challenged by the neo communists to its right by the Christian Democrat party (KDH) led by Mr Jan Carnogursky the Slovak National Party (SNS) led by Mr Ludovit Cernak and smaller parties representing ethnic Hungarians.
But the ability of the HZDS to command the centre ground has been undermined by the inability of the government to deliver the promised economic recovery and growing disillusionment with the suspicious combative personality of its leader.
The erosion of confidence in the HZDS and deep often personal animosities between leaders of the non communist parties has inevitably rebounded to the benefit of the former communist SLD.
Like their Polish counterparts Mr Weiss and key aides such as Mr Pavel Kanis the SLD deputy chairman have spent the last four years trying to shed the stigma of the Soviet imposed communist past and present themselves as a respectable democratic party eligible for membership in a future government coalition.
At the last elections in June 1992 the SLD already emerged as the second largest party with 28 seats in the 150 seat Narodna Rada the single chamber Slovak parliament.
The SLD was dwarfed by the HZDS which won 74 seats won but came out well ahead of the Slovak Nationalist Party (SNS) which was the only party to stand unambiguously in favour of Slovak independence.
The SNS won only 15 seats and agreed to become a junior coalition partner in the post election HZDS SNS government.
This government collapsed last March when Mr Ludovit Cernak the SNS leader took his party out of the coalition after attacking Mr Meciar for his alleged authoritarian style and his closeness to politicians such as the Defence and Culture Ministers with shady political antecedents and ties to Czechoslovakia s Moscow dominated past.
Last month however Mr Cernak agreed in principle to take his party back into the government mainly because his reluctance to risk early elections which the former communists might win proved stronger than personal and political antipathy to Mr Meciar.
A renewed HZDS SNS coalition still to be finalised at the time of writing would create a secure parliamentary majority and ensure passage of next year s budget.
It would give a reprieve to Mr Meciar whose shaky minority government has been dangerously weak since Mr Milan Knazko a former actor who was a popular idol of the VPN movement in 1989 was sacked as foreign minister five months ago.
Mr Knazko left the HZDS after fierce arguments with Mr Meciar over policy towards ethnic minorities and neighbouring states.
He has since formed his own breakaway party the Alliance of Independent Democrats with eight seats in parliament.
The new alliance patches up the government but does not reduce the underlying challenge from the former communist SLD or the risk of sharing the fate suffered by Poland s Solidarity era parties.
But Slovakia does not share Poland s deeper political culture or its self confidence as one of the historic nations of eastern Europe.
The reform communists who form the frontline of the Polish Democratic Left Alliance were committed to reformist politics before being swept from power in 1989 and have been able to attract support from the new business class which has since emerged.
The communists who ran Czechoslovakia in the Stalinist years and after the Soviet invasion of 1968 were almost to a man grey mediocrities who showed an insensitivity bred of ignorance to tradition and theenvironment.
Nowhere was the deliberate destruction of the creative and productive middle class more complete than in former Czechoslovakia which before the war together with its large German and Jewish minorities formed perhaps the most successful democracy in continental Europe.
And the Slovak part of the old republic singled out for investment in heavy industry suffered the most.
Given this history the risk of a return to power of parties with their roots in Slovakia s communist past is a sobering one.
The men who lead the party seem bright and intelligent.
But with Slovakia s slow record of reform to date many of the old nomenklatura bosses are still running the various bureaucracies the big state owned factories and the security forces.
Several former communists are already in the HZDS government.
It is difficult to escape the conclusion that once the reformed communists regained power in their own right it might be difficult to remove them.
Ironically the widespread sense that the former communists represent the most likely alternative to the HZDS together with the personal rivalries and relative inexperience of the non communist opposition parties are the main factors keeping Mr Meciar in power.
With him Slovak politics cannot be brought to the level needed to modernise the economy and society says Mr Igor Uhrik vicepresident of the SNS and one of a handful of expatriate Slovaks who have returned to contribute their skills and foreign experience to building up the new state.
But Mr Meciar is in charge and while he remains that way he will be the one to choose the timing of the next election to his greatest advantage.
Adventure in statehood Slovaks were wary when their 74 year old marriage with the Czechs ended peacefully at the start of 1993.
Now caution has been replaced by a quiet determination to succeed.
Anthony Robinson describes the new Republic s problems and prospects.
ON New Year s day 1993 Slovaks sloughed off a thousand year subservience to Hungary and seven decades as the junior partner in Czechoslovakia and celebrated the birth of a sovereign independent internationally recognised republic.
But only six months earlier most Slovaks went into the crucial general elections of June 1992 intending to negotiate a new and looser union with their richer and more numerous Czech cousins but not to be divorced from them.
Opinion polls showed that divorce was only sought by a small minority in both the Czech lands and Slovakia.
Many Slovaks were in favour of seeking greater political and cultural autonomy but fewer than 10 per cent voted for the openly separatist Slovak National Party (SNS).
The 600 000 ethnic Hungarian minority was virtually unanimous in opposition to breaking ties with Prague as were the less politically organised Gypsy Ukrainian Ruthenian and other minorities living mainly in the east and south of the country.
But the election results put political power into the hands of politicians with incompatible ideas about acceptable terms for cohabitation in a common state.
The Czech leader Mr Vaclav Klaus made clear from the outset that a clean divorce was preferable to a messy protracted squabble over the terms of cohabitation.
As the Czechs were the richest and the most populous members of the 74 year old Czechoslovak state Mr Klaus was able to determine the subsequent course of events.
Mr Vladimir Meciar the pugnacious Slovak leader who turned his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) into the dominant force in Slovak politics by his attacks on Czech arrogance and insensitivity to Slovakia s needs found himself with no alternative but to negotiate the best terms for divorce.
In contrast with Yugoslavia where the number of states nationalities and cultural and ethnic groups involved was much greater and where past violent conflicts over borders and between groups had left indelible scars the Czech and Slovak divorce negotiations were tough but amicable.
But a mere 10 months of separate existence have already brought about palpable changes in perspective.
On both sides of what is now an international border between the two states apprehension about the possible unforeseen consequences of separation has been largely replaced by a determination to make independence work.
Both states insist on their European vocation and their desire for the fastest possible integration into a suitably extended European Community and revamped Nato.
A young Slovak diplomat from the east of the country the part which was most opposed to the idea of rule from Bratislava and gave the lowest votes to Mr Meciar summed up the reaction of many of her generation.
We did not want to be cut off from Prague and the Czech part of our country.
We felt nervous about being alone in this part of the world.
But now I am amazed to find how little we have in common with the Czechs and how tied up we are in trying to solve our own problems here in Slovakia.
For Prague the divorce meant the end of an implicit economic subsidy to Slovakia at the cost of a 30 per cent loss of trade between the two new states.
It also freed the Czechs from entanglements inherited from the inter war republic whose borders were drawn to include a large Hungarian minority at the end of the first world war.
For Bratislava independence promised the psychological and spiritual satisfaction of permitting the majority ethnic Slovaks the opportunity to develop and assert their own national personality at home and abroad after a millennium as a largely ignored or subservient people.
But it has required an enormous effort to build up the institutions and trappings of a sovereign state.
For more than 70 years many of the most able Slovaks moved to senior jobs in Prague and few were prepared to return to Bratislava to create a new state especially under the political conditions created by the HZDS victory in the elections.
In spite of the difficulties however Slovakia now has an independent central bank a national currency (hastily introduced in six weeks instead of the expected six months after the divorce) a national army and security forces and diplomatic representation abroad.
It has obtained international recognition and membership of a wide range of international institutions including the IMF the World Bank and the EBRD.
It has also signed a separate association agreement with the EC and gained membership of the Council of Europe after the last minute withdrawal by Hungary of objections linked to the rights of ethnic Hungarians.
Both economically and strategically however the new Slovakia inherited substantial real and potential problems.
Already hard hit by the collapse of Comecon markets and the end of the Cold War the disintegration of the highly integrated Czechoslovak economy has led to a sharp drop in trade with the Czech republic at a time when recession in western markets has reduced the already limited ability to shift to OECD markets.
Unemployment is high and foreign investment remains low while the pre divorce wave of Czechoslovak privatisation has not been followed by a similarly determined all Slovak version.
Without rapid privatisation and higher foreign investment Slovakia s ability to build a less energy and raw material intensive economy more attuned to international trade will remain in doubt.
The potential certainly exists for a successful transformation of the economy given the high level of technical skills and current low wage rates.
In the service sector tourism also has good prospects once the unfriendly rigid state hotel structure is replaced by small scale private and local tourist initiatives.
This year Slovakia is expected to earn only Dollars 200m from tourism a fraction of what could be earned by creative exploitation of a rich natural endowment which includes the high and low Tatra mountains much untouched countryside and a plethora of castles churches and cultural treasures.
A lot depends on Slovakia s ability to project itself properly as a peaceful stable democratic country at ease with its neighbours and not only open to foreign investment but able to create the banking legal and institutional framework that potential investors can feel familiar with.
This is not always the case and some small investors have found difficulty seeking redress for alleged irregularities.
But the main question hangs over Slovakia s ability to forge a mutually satisfactory relationship with Hungary.
This is highlighted by the dispute over Slovakia s unilateral decision to go ahead with completing the Gabcikovo dam on the River Danube and irritating resistance to the ethnic Hungarian minority s desire for dual Hungarian Slovak place names in areas of Hungarian settlement and the right not to use the Slovak suffix added to female Hungarian surnames.
The dam issue which aroused greater passions in Hungary than merited by the controversial ecological issues alone is currently under adjudication by the International Court at the Hague.
The Slovak side points out that it was Budapest which first acted unilaterally by pulling out of the joint scheme.
Mr Jozef Moravcik the foreign minister also compares the high degree of cultural and linguistic autonomy enjoyed by Slovakia s Hungarian minority with the assimilation pressures to which ethnic Slovaks have been subjected in Hungary.
Wise heads in Bratislava have tried to defuse potential tensions by quiet diplomacy fearing that the intemperate words sometimes used by Mr Meciar when referring to both the Hungarian and Gypsy minorities could inflame passions and contribute to the re ignition of latent ethnic tensions throughout the wider Carpathian region.
The rise of nationalist parties in Hungary and Romania underlines the risks involved in playing the ethnic card.
Opinion polls indicate that Mr Meciar still retains a core following in his home territory of central Slovakia in the scenically attractive villages of the Vah valley and the Tatra mountains.
These are the areas economically hardest hit by the collapse of the arms industry and the loss of Comecon markets on which Slovakia was so heavily dependent before the death of the Soviet system.
It is far harder to find supporters in Bratislava the capital which is tucked away at the extreme south west of the country only 65kms from Vienna or in Kosice the regional capital of eastern Slovakia even though unemployment and the attendant social pains are lower in these two big cities.
Mr Meciar may not be the ideal politician to lead Slovakia into independence but his latest deal with the Nationalist Party (SNS) should give him the parliamentary majority needed to get next year s tough budget approved and fight off left wing opposition demands for early elections.
The international financial institutions are helping to fund investment projects pending the hoped for awakening of foreign private investment.
FT 01 JAN 94 Slovaks mark a first year of misery.
As Slovaks prepared this week to celebrate their first year of independence they found little to cheer about in Bratislava the capital where revellers danced through the night 12 months ago.
The economy remains deeply in recession inflation is above 25 per cent and unemployment is 14 per cent and rising.
Political infighting threatens to bring down the government whose paper thin parliamentary majority could be overturned at any time on any vote.
Demands for autonomy by ethnic Hungarians who represent around 12 per cent of the country s population are raising fears of ethnic tensions and friction with Hungary historic ruler of the Slovak lands.
According to a recent poll 60 per cent of Slovaks would oppose breaking up the former Czechoslovak federation if they could vote today though like their Czech neighbours they were never asked to vote on independence.
The split was engineered chiefly by Mr Vladimir Meciar the Slovak prime minister and by Mr Vaclav Klaus his Czech counterpart.
The latter seized on the opportunity for a quick divorce that would leave the Czech Republic free to pursue its own accelerated drive towards a free market economy.
The only party to campaign unambiguously for Slovak independence at the June 1992 general election was the Slovak National party (SNS) but it won less than 10 per cent of the vote.
Other parties mostly hoped to win greater economic and political autonomy within a reformed Czechoslovak federation and none were prepared for the consequences of independence.
Democracy has suffered as a result in both countries as evidenced by growing disillusionment with politicians in Slovakia and widespread cynicism in the Czech Republic over corruption among the business and political elite.
Dissatisfaction is greatest in Slovakia where Mr Meciar s Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won 74 of the 150 parliamentary seats a year and a half ago but now barely commands 16 per cent of support in opinion polls the same as the left wing Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) successor to the former Communist party.
But the SNS the HZDS s partner in the recently formed coalition is also faring badly with 14 parliamentary seats but only 7 per cent support in the polls.
The coalition formed in November after months of haggling over government posts promised political stability but it is already falling apart at the seams.
The 1994 budget only just scraped through parliament in December with a margin of three votes two of which were cast in error by members of the opposition while some coalition deputies abstained.
In theory the 66 seats of the HZDS and the 14 seats of the SNS assure the government of a clear majority but the HZDS has since lost another deputy its ninth defection since the start of the year and the SNS has split into two factions.
This makes early elections this year increasingly likely unless Mr Meciar agrees to demands by president Michal Kovac for a broad coalition a solution made more difficult by dislike of Mr Meciar by most of his rivals.
Mr Meciar will resist any moves to replace him and only parliament can call elections.
A solution (to the crisis) is in the hands of parliament and the HZDS says a senior official from the president s office.
