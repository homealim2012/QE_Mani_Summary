19920117000000000	FT  17 JAN 92 / Big rise in attacks on foreigners. The number of attacks on foreigners in Germany increased tenfold in 1991 to 2,368, according to a confidential government report disclosed by a Berlin newspaper yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin. The problem has prompted a police crackdown on neo-Nazi gangs and greater effort to protect foreigners. The report recorded hundreds of fire bombings of hostels for asylum-seekers as well as physical assaults on individuals. It said most of the culprits were neo-Nazi skinheads and right-wing high school students, apprentices or unemployed young people.
19920117000000000	FT  17 JAN 92 / Big rise in attacks on foreigners in Germany. THE number of attacks on foreigners in Germany increased tenfold in 1991 to 2,368, according to a confidential government report disclosed by a Berlin newspaper yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin. 'The drastic increase has led to serious unease among asylum-seeking and (resident) foreigners in Germany,' the report said. The problem has prompted a police crackdown on neo-Nazi gangs and greater effort to protect foreigners. The report recorded hundreds of fire bombings of hostels for asylum-seekers as well as physical assaults on individuals. It said most of the culprits were neo-Nazi skinheads and right-wing high school students, apprentices or unemployed young people.
19920107000000000	FT  07 JAN 92 / German parties' asylum deal faltering. GERMANY'S four leading parties have called new talks tomorrow to deal with the soaring numbers of asylum-seekers in the country, amid signs that their previous compromise is falling apart, Quentin Peel writes from Bonn. The issue threatens once again to explode politically, after an arson attack on a refugee hostel in the Black Forest on Sunday left a Lebanese immigrant critically ill. At the same time, publication of statistics for 1991 showed the number of asylum-seekers in Germany reached 256,112, almost 33 per cent higher than a year earlier. The latest talks between the ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) come amid reports that their previous agreement, to protect refugees by gathering them in big camps and to speed procedures for dealing with asylum claims, cannot be put into effect for months, if at all. The Christian Democrats (CDU), senior partners in the ruling coalition, maintain the vast majority of asylum-seekers are, in reality, economic migrants seeking work. They want an amendment to the German constitution to allow immigration officials to stop such applicants at the border and send them home. The SPD and the Free Democrats in the ruling coalition reject changes in the constitution as too drastic and insist the problem can be dealt with by improving procedures to process asylum-seekers. Only one state - Baden-Wurttemberg - has adequate capacity to house refugees in the proposed 'collection camps', according to a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. The asylum issue remains acutely sensitive at a time of rising discontent over higher taxes to pay for German unification, and the inflow of immigrants of both German and non-German origin. The latest attack was on a hostel housing some 40 refugees at Waldkirch in Breisgau, near Freiburg in the country's prosperous south-west. Yesterday saw a spontaneous demonstration by about 400 people in Waldkirch, protesting against 'hostility to foreigners'. Publication of the latest asylum statistics seems certain to heighten debate, however. They show that almost 77 per cent of applications were rejected as unfounded, 16 per cent more were withdrawn, and only 6.9 per cent were deemed to be genuine cases for political asylum under Germany's liberal laws. Of the total, 74,854 came from Yugoslavia, 40,504 from Romania, 23,877 from Turkey and 12,056 from Bulgaria.
19920107000000000	FT  07 JAN 92 / German asylum accord falters. GERMANY'S four leading parties have called new talks tomorrow to deal with the soaring numbers of asylum-seekers in the country, amid signs that their previous compromise is falling apart. The issue threatens once again to explode politically, with an arson attack on a refugee hostel in the Black Forest on Sunday night leaving a Lebanese immigrant critically ill. At the same time, publication of statistics for 1991 showed the number of asylum-seekers in Germany reached 256,112, almost 33 per cent higher than a year earlier. The figures were boosted by a sharp increase in the number of refugees fleeing the civil war in Yugoslavia, and those from eastern Europe. The latest cross-party talks between the ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) come amid reports that their previous agreement, to protect refugees by gathering them in large camps and to accelerate procedures for dealing with asylum applications, cannot be put into effect for months, if at all. The Christian Democrats (CDU), senior partners in the ruling coalition, maintain the vast majority of asylum-seekers are, in reality, economic migrants seeking work. They want an amendment to the German constitution to allow immigration officials to stop such applicants at the border and send them home. The SPD and the Free Democrats in the ruling coalition reject changes in the constitution as too drastic and insist the problem can be dealt with by improving procedures to process asylum-seekers. Only one federal state - Baden-Wurttemberg - has adequate capacity to house refugees in the proposed 'collection camps,' according to a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. There are still not enough legally trained personnel to process the flood of asylum applications within six weeks, as the parties had agreed. And legal amendments are still required to the asylum law to speed up application procedures from the current average of about 12 months to only six weeks. The asylum issue remains acutely sensitive at a time of rising discontent over higher taxes to pay for German unification, and the inflow of immigrants of both German and non-German origin. The latest attack was on a hostel housing some 40 refugees at Waldkirch in Breisgau, near Freiburg in the country's prosperous south-west. Both entrances to the hostel were on fire when the police and fire-brigade arrived at 1am, and the inmates had retreated to the third floor. Twenty were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, and one man was reported yesterday still to be in a critical condition. Skinhead gangs have carried out a string of attacks on immigrant hostels over the past six months, although they have been condemned by all political parties except the extreme right. Yesterday saw a spontaneous demonstration by about 400 people in Waldkirch, protesting against 'hostility to foreigners.' Publication of the latest asylum statistics seems certain to heighten debate, however. They show that almost 77 per cent of applications were rejected as unfounded, another 16 per cent were withdrawn, and only 6.9 per cent were deemed to be genuine cases for political asylum under Germany's liberal laws.

19920323000000000	FT  23 MAR 92 / Arrests follow Leipzig protests. GERMAN police said yesterday they had detained 67 people after anarchists, many of them masked, hurled rocks and smashed car windows at an anti-racism demonstration in the eastern city of Leipzig, Reuter reports. Leipzig city police said 17 officers were slightly injured after 900 policemen, reinforced by paramilitary border guards, used water cannon and truncheons on Saturday to drive the 400 anarchists away from the city centre. Witnesses saw several demonstrators with blood streaming down their faces from head wounds but the police did not give any figures for the number hurt. A police helicopter was struck several times by fireworks hurled by the demonstrators. Anarchists set car tyres and rubbish containers alight as they fought behind hastily erected barricades. Fifteen people were under investigation for illegal possession of arms and damaging property, police said. The riot, the biggest in the former communist east Germany since left-wingers fought police in Halle last November, occurred after a peaceful demonstration by around 1,000 people. Carrying banners saying 'Foreigners in, Nazis out', they protested against another rally in the city organised by the National Offensive, an extreme right-wing group. Police said they found a petrol bomb hidden in the square where the neo-Nazi rally was to start later. Some 300 right-wingers chanting Adolf Hitler's slogan 'One people, one Reich, one Fuhrer' and giving the illegal Nazi salute later marched through central Leipzig.
19920323000000000	FT  23 MAR 92 / Bonn faces immigration setback: Pleas for Volga Germans to stay put in Russia fall on deaf ears. THE German government's campaign to persuade up to 2m ethnic Germans living in the former Soviet Union not to emigrate received a serious setback at the weekend. Representatives of the so-called Volga German community called on both Russia and Germany urgently to draw up a plan to enable all who wish to leave to do so in three to five years. They rejected promises by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to re-create the autonomous German homeland on the Volga river as amounting to 'an effective refusal to take effective measures to recreate German autonomy'. The three-day congress of Volga Germans in Moscow heard an appeal by Mr Horst Waffenschmidt, the German state secretary for internal affairs, to accept the offer of a new homeland in Russia. 'The door to Germany is still open,' he told the congress, 'but I must say clearly and honestly that we can only accept a limited number of immigrants.' He was answered bluntly by Mr Heinrich Groth, chairman of the largest organisation of Volga Germans, called Rebirth: 'All those who want to emigrate, must be allowed to emigrate.' Most of the Soviet Union's ethnic Germans were deported from the Volga region and Ukraine to Siberia and Kazakhstan by Stalin during the war. The slim chance that, in the present chaotic situation in Russia, they might be persuaded to resettle rather than opt for their constitutional right to return to Germany, seems now to have been undermined by Mr Yeltsin. Although the Russian president promised in Bonn last year to re-establish the Volga republic, the reality seems decidedly unattractive. On a subsequent trip to Saratov, former capital of the Volga republic, he proposed resettling the community on the abandoned missile-testing site at Kapustin Yar - a clear sop to local Russian fears. The prospect of mass immigration of anything up to 2m Volga Germans, many of whose ancestors came to Russia up to 200 years ago, is one which fills the authorities in Bonn with alarm. The issue of asylum seekers in Germany, arriving in the country at more than 30,000 a month, is already causing political and social problems. The German authorities are extremely anxious not to see that immigration issue mixed up with the sensitive question of allowing ethnic Germans to return, which is enshrined in the constitution. The country has seen a flood of Germans returning, initially from eastern Europe and increasingly from the former Soviet Union. Between 1989 and 1991 there were almost 1m, although the number fell from a peak of more than 397,000 in 1990 to almost 222,000 last year. Mr Waffenschmidt's brief is to offer substantial German government investment wherever the emigre communities can be persuaded to stay where they are.
19920327000000000	FT  27 MAR 92 / Attack on Kurds sours friendship. THE malaise in Turkish/German relations, with Bonn suspending arms shipments over the alleged use of German military aid to put down Kurdish demonstrations, owes something to the realisation on both sides that the special relationship is over. Historically, Germany has been Turkey's main European ally. The two fought together in the First World War. More recently the relationship has been cemented by economic links. In the growth years of the last three decades Turkish Gastarbeiter (guest workers) have played a vital role in both economies, particularly for Turkey. Turkish workers last year sent home Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 860m). However, the relationship is souring. Turkish feathers were ruffled during the Gulf War, when Germany initially failed to respond to Turkey's request for military aid, in the end sending eight Alpha jets. Behind the malaise is the realisation that, following German unification and developments in eastern Europe, Turkey is less important to Germany as an economic partner. Germany's dependence on Turkish labour has lessened. Indeed German aid is used as subsidised credits to entice Turkish workers home. Although DM13m (Pounds 4.5m) has been spent on rehabilitation and business schemes, as many as 1.5m Turks seem determined to stay permanently in Germany. Many guestworkers, perhaps 400,000, are of Kurdish origin. They provide much of the financial support for the separatist Kurdish Workers party whose political wing operates openly in Germany. Ankara has repeatedly called on Bonn to ban their activities. Yesterday's crisis follows television reports from south-east Turkey showing Turkish security forces using old east German armoured vehicles to attack Kurdish demonstrators. Most worrying for Ankara is the linking of the Kurdish issue to EC membership for Turkey.
19920407000000000	FT  07 APR 92 / The right creeps through the cracks: The asylum issue has dealt a blow to the German coalition. Just up the road from Hamburg, Germany's richest city, lies Itzehoe, an average sort of place, a swampy socialist stronghold close to the Elbe estuary. In 1988, 72 per cent of the population turned out for the Schleswig-Holstein state elections and 72 per cent of them delivered their votes to the rising Mr Bjorn Engholm, soon to be the Social Democrats' national leader. A drubbing for the Christian Democrats was par for the course. Last weekend, only 48 per cent of the local electorate troubled to vote. With neat, if depressing, symmetry, about the same measly proportion chose the SPD. Almost 20 per cent shared out their votes between the extreme right-wing Republicans and the German People's Union (DVU). The reason is to be found just down the road from Itzehoe, in Oelixdorf, an ancient suburb chosen by the Schleswig-Holstein state government as its main clearing centre for asylum-seekers. Every day, Oelixdorf and communities throughout the federal republic are obliged to take in, feed, transport, house and often clothe increasing numbers of people fleeing war, economic hardship and the other forms of oppression known to man. Last year, Germany's liberal asylum laws obliged the country to let in 256,112 such people. Ten years ago the total was 49,391. Last month alone, according to the federal asylum office's meticulous arithmetic, 35,059 arrived on the doorstep. Yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Engholm, the SPD's chosen one to challenge for the chancellorship in the 1994 federal elections, picked up their share of the bill. The SPD just held on to power in the Kiel parliament, but saw its share of the overall vote slashed from 55 per cent to 46 per cent. Meanwhile, in simultaneous elections in Baden-Wurttemberg, Mr Kohl's CDU lost its absolute majority, held for 20 years. Stuttgart was the last state capital in the old west Germany where the Christian Democrats ruled alone. The DVU, with six seats in the Kiel state parliament, and the Republicans, with 15 in Stuttgart, shared the spoils and became the third-largest political groups represented in both assemblies. For once the establishment parties were united. The result, they said yesterday, was a blow, a tragedy, a catastrophe or worse for democracy. A formal verdict on the consequences for democracy must wait until 1994, when a rash of state and local polls, topped by federal elections in October, will deliver a more determinate judgment on the Bonn bodgers. The result was two black eyes, one for Mr Kohl and one for Mr Engholm. Above all, the outcome reflected anger and disenchantment with mainstream politicians, the paralysis of the muddlesome conservative/liberal federal coalition and its loss of contact with the realities of life beyond Bonn, the so-called Bundesdorf nestling by the Rhine. The failure of the socialists to draw any advantage from the CDU's collapse in Baden-Wurttemberg - in Pforzheim, for example, where the Republicans picked up 18.5 per cent of the vote, the SPD's share fell from 34 per cent to 28 per cent - amply demonstrates that the SPD offers no credible alternative. Mr Engholm, who was pushed into accepting the party's nomination as chancellor candidate before he was ready, has not yet taken a firm enough grip on the party to break its old habits of tying itself in ideological knots. With an estimated 40,000 members between them in all Germany, neither the DVU nor the Replicans have the necessary clout to fill the political gap. Even so, by latching on to and linking up the 'fear' issues, shown up by unfailingly accurate opinion polls - asylum-seekers, rising crime, unemployment and housing shortages - they made their mark at the weekend. Mr Franz Schonhuber, Republican leader, who describes his party as 'clearly right of the centre', campaigned hard on law and order, and an end to immigration. His counterpart in the DVU, Mr Gerhard Frey, plastered Schleswig-Holstein with leaflets proclaiming 'Germany should stay German'. As yesterday's post mortem showed, they owed their success to city-dwelling, working-class males under 30. What the opinion samplers did not examine was the depth of the malaise which produced the shock result. Asylum is only one - and far from the worst - of the bogeymen stalking Germany. To many inhabitants, the federal republic has become almost a foreign country: everything has changed. Unification realised a politician's dream but brought with it 16m dependents, victims of the earthquake which swept away the east German economy. The chancellor lied when he said there would be no taxes to pay for unification, and then hit everybody with a 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' on their income tax. The collapse of European communism, another cause for celebration, quickly soured as last year 200,000 ethnic Germans joined the influx of people seeking asylum mainly from the former Soviet Union. Well over 1m east Germans, still objects of profound suspicion in the old federal republic, also migrated westwards. The economic slowdown is not a recession - official. But in factories and offices where people are being told that they should accept a virtual wage freeze for the next few years, it certainly feels like one. And to top it all, as the headlines said, 'They are giving away the Deutschemark]' in the interests of something called European unity. As the mass circulation Bild newspaper remarked: 'Adieu stability.' The lack of leadership, internal unity and stability has been apparent for months in Bonn. The weekend's upsets show how far its effects have spread: from the relatively poor 'fisheaters' in the north to the industrial fatlands of Daimler-Benz country in the south. Where is it all leading? To the conference table; first within individual party headquarters. 'These are protest votes and all the major parties must reflect and ask what we have done wrong,' said Mr Volker Ruhe, outgoing general secretary of the CDU and incoming defence minister. Then, according to yesterday's consensus, it will be time for all - excluding the far right - to sit down together and hammer out a new working relationship. As Mr Kohl has repeatedly said since the turn of the year, Germany faces 18 months without elections, a period in which to draw up a list of priorities and ways of dealing with them. Hopefuls in the SPD have proposed a grand coalition in Bonn, but such ideas, and even suggestions of a round table to plan 'rational-national' strategies, have been ruled out by a chancellor refusing to allow the weekend's shocks to loosen his grip on the reins of power. Mr Engholm claims the problems confronting the country are too great and too urgent to be dealt with in the confrontational atmosphere of the Bundestag, and Mr Kohl acknowledges their scale and urgency. But he seems as much concerned with maintaining his image as the strong man of German politics and dragging his fractious opposition, as well as dissenters in the liberal ranks, into line, and together finding a way through the current logjam. His priorities, which he listed yesterday, may seem pedestrian in the light of the mass of difficulties crowding in, but touch the heart of German political sensibilities. He wants new laws to tighten controls over the flow of asylum-seekers, a new system for funding the care of the elderly, and adoption of new rules to make abortion more accessible. His demands challenge principles held sacred by opposition, political allies and friends alike. Proposals for these changes have been blocked for months by opposition from within the SPD and even within coalition allies. The SPD considers the constitution, which allows anyone asking for asylum to be allowed into the country, inviolable. Where will the pressure for amendments and infringements on people's liberties stop if the government is allowed to change the country's basic law, they ask. Without co-operation from the socialists the government has no chance of achieving the 75 per cent majority needed in the Bundestag for constitutional change, and even less of forcing an amendment through the SPD-dominated Bundesrat, the upper house. Members of the opposition and the minority coalition partners, the Free Democrats, believe plans for self-funded systems under which people would have to pay for nursing and attention in their old age are symptoms of a conservative desire to dismantle the welfare state. On abortion reform, Mr Kohl faces dour resistance from his cabinet colleagues in the catholic south of the country. At issue is the inflexibility of a socio-political system which is showing signs of being unable to bear the burdens piled on it by politicians, labour unions and history. The greatest of these, and a 'priority' often mentioned by Mr Kohl in recent weeks but neglected yesterday, is the assimilation of the former East Germany. At present virtually all the costs of unification are being borne by the federal budget. All the popular resentment is accumulating on Mr Kohl's shoulders. If, as he says, he wants state budgets to take a greater share of the costs, and the people of Germany to take home less real pay, expect less from the mother-hen state, work longer hours and retire at 65 instead of 60, he is going to have to show a measure of unaccustomed flexibility and to give ground to opposition demands in return for concessions. The present political framework was tested in a small way at the weekend polls, and it cracked. Ugly and unwelcome, the far right crept out through the gaps. The danger for Mr Kohl is that in 1994's elections the cracks could turn into gaping chasms, swallowing up the 'Unification Chancellor' and releasing even more unwelcome guests than showed up at the wake yesterday.
19920403000000000	FT  03 APR 92 / Kohl stands firm on Turkey row. CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany refused to back down yesterday in his confrontation with Turkey, insisting that German weapons supplied to its Nato ally can only be used for its defence 'in the framework of the alliance'. Although he stopped short of direct criticism of Turkey's campaign against Kurdish guerrillas and civilians, which caused Germany to suspend all arms shipments last week, he said that Ankara must observe all its commitments to human and minority rights. In a parliamentary debate on the row between the two normally close allies, Mr Kohl sought to turn the debacle to belated electoral advantage. With an eye on the state elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein on Sunday, the chancellor delivered a ringing defence of his government's foreign policy. But Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD parliamentary leader, taunted Mr Kohl for allowing the row to get out of hand. He said that Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, had been forced to intervene between the Nato partners. 'We have reached a sorry state when our big brother in the alliance, the US, must help us to return to the path of foreign policy virtue,' he said. The number of foreigners seeking political asylum in Germany reached a record of more than 35,000 last month, with refugees from Yugoslavia alone running at 13,175. Romania was the second largest source, with 5,544 and Turkey third with 2,406. Turkey is to introduce economic reforms for the impoverished Kurdish minority after unrest in the area in which more than 100 have died in the past 10 days, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. The measures represent the first concrete steps to address the Kurdish problem and stem growing support for the Syrian backed Kurdish Workers Party which is fighting an eight year campaign for independence.
19920616000000000	FT  16 JUN 92 / Refugee's return averts rift with Bonn. A SUDANESE refugee at the centre of a tussle over European asylum procedures has been discreetly sent back to Germany by the British authorities, defusing a potential source of strain in UK-German relations. The Home Office confirmed that Mr Ahmed Gazmalhaliq Abdulla, whose tortuous journey from Sudan and then around Europe has brought wide attention, was sent back to Germany on May 12. This was after Mr Abdulla's lawyers, who claimed he risked persecution in Germany, failed to win permission for a court appeal to allow him to seek asylum in Britain. Mr Abdulla, who had spent almost a year in an asylum-seekers' hostel in Germany, travelled to Britain at the end of last year after his hostel had been attacked several times by rightwing extremists during violence against immigrants in Germany last autumn. UK authorities rejected Mr Abdulla's asylum request, but in January the Home Office gave him temporary approval to remain in Britain while lawyers prepared a case to back his claim that he would be under threat in Germany. By appearing to support the notion that immigrants faced the danger of racial persecution in Germany, the UK's decision raised controversy in Britain and Germany. The Home Office said the case had been 'blown up out of all proportion'. If Britain had given the refugee a permanent home it would almost certainly have affected political relations between London and Bonn, and could have led to similar departures of immigrants from Germany to the UK. This seems to have accounted for the government's rapid action to send Mr Abdulla back. His lawyers claim that the decision was taken in spite of only patchy evidence that violence against foreigners is abating in Germany. The number of cases, which totalled 2,427 last year, amounted to 809 in the first four months of this year. This was down by more than half from the final four months of last year, when there was a bulge in the number of cases recorded. But it was still four times the number of cases for the first four months of 1991.
19920930000000000	FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: A third of German youth hostile towards foreigners. ALMOST one in three young German adults admits to being hostile towards foreigners, according to a survey published yesterday. The rest of the nation's youth views antagonism towards foreigners as a serious problem for society - although second in overall importance to the state of the environment - but only 25 per cent reject 'all forms of discrimination' against non-Germans. The study, which described its sample as 'self-confident, constructively critical, realistic and informed', involved more than 2,000 people, aged between 16 and 24, and was carried out by the Institute for Empirical Psychology. The ministry for youth and family responded to the findings with a claim that other studies showed only 1 per cent of the age group surveyed was prepared to use violence against foreigners. However, the study, which appeared as sporadic attacks on asylum-seekers continued, and followed the weekend fire-bombing of the Jewish barracks in the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp, showed that 13 per cent were 'resolutely' anti-foreigner. In a previous similar survey, made in 1990, less than 30 per cent believed xenophobia was a serious problem. Since the end of that year, however, the number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany each year has almost doubled. More than 400,000 are expected this year.
19920930000000000	FT  30 SEP 92 / One in three Germans 'hostile' to foreigners. ALMOST one in three young German adults admits to being hostile towards foreigners, or at least being susceptible to xenophobic thoughts, according to a survey published yesterday. The rest of the nation's youth views antagonism towards foreigners as a serious problem for society - although second in overall importance to the state of the environment - but only 25 per cent reject 'all forms of discrimination' against non-Germans. The study, which described its sample as 'self-confident, constructively critical, realistic and informed', involved more than 2,000 people, aged between 16 and 24, and was carried out by the Institute for Empirical Psychology. It was funded by IBM Deutschland. Two years after unification, the study has uncovered converging ambitions and opinions between young people from both sides of the country, but 80 per cent of easterners still feel themselves to be 'second-class Germans'. More than two-thirds also miss some of the good things from their past life under communism, mainly social welfare and child care facilities. Half of those in the west and three-quarters of those in the east say their economic expectations of unification had not been fulfilled. And while Germany's main problem in the eyes of young westerners remains environmental protection, 95 per cent of easterners worry most about increasing unemployment. The ministry for youth and family responded to the findings with a claim that other studies showed only 1 per cent of the age group surveyed was prepared to use violence against foreigners. However, the report showed how important it was for older people to speak plainly and openly to foster understanding, said Ms Cornelia Yzer, parliamentary state secretary. The study, which appeared as sporadic attacks on asylum-seekers continued, and followed the weekend fire-bombing on the Jewish barracks in the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp, showed that 13 per cent were 'resolutely' anti-foreigner. In a previous similar survey, made in 1990, less than 30 per cent believed xenophobia was a serious problem. Since the end of that year, however, the number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany each year has almost doubled. More than 400,000 are expected this year. There were almost 1,500 violent attacks on foreigners in 1991 - a five-fold increase - and a further rise is expected this year.
19920918000000000	FT  18 SEP 92 / German right-wing extremists 'no danger'. MR Alexander von Stahl, the German advocate general, asserted that right-wing militant organisations did not represent a danger to Germany despite the wave of attacks against asylum-seekers. Mr von Stahl said no organisational structure could be detected among the largely young German assailants. Instead, the assaults on foreigners were frequently 'locally, spontaneously and often very alcoholically motivated,' he suggested. Mr von Stahl's controversial remarks contradicted persistent indications that right-wing groups in east and west Germany had managed to influence a considerable number of young east German extremists. German police yesterday arrested seven neo-Nazis and issued arrest warrants for six more after raiding more than 100 homes to crack down on rightist violence. Heinz Wolf, police chief in the eastern German state of Saxony, said the raids on Wednesday by more than 500 policemen yielded a large haul of illegal weapons and racist pamphlets. He said the raids were made after investigations into attacks on foreigners by rightist youths, many of them skinheads. Those arrested were accused of breach of the peace, arson and grievous bodily harm. Youths in the east German port city of Wismar in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern attacked a hostel for asylum-seekers late on Wednesday for the third night in succession. Police took eight persons into temporary custody. Unidentified persons threw a Molotov cocktail against a hostel for asylum-seekers in Zemitz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, but guards were able to extinguish the blaze quickly. The interior ministry yesterday said Romania had agreed to take back its citizens who fail to prove they suffered political persecution at home. The statement said Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters has been seeking agreements with the main countries involved to take back their citizens if they fail to win asylum in Germany. Until now, rejected refugees were allowed to appeal the decision and in practice remained in Germany for years. Sixty per cent of the 43,000 Romanians who came to Germany from January to the end of August were gypsies but only 0.2 per cent of them have been granted asylum.
19920902000000000	FT  02 SEP 92 / German riots may lead to foreign boycott. GERMAN politicians are warning of a possible foreign boycott of German products and a halt in investments in east Germany as a result of continuing militant rightwing attacks on asylum seekers in the East. Mr Heiner Geissler, deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic (CDU-CSU) party, yesterday cautioned against the danger of a boycott if people believed internationally that racism was being resurrected in Germany. 'Every third job (in Germany) is dependent on foreigners buying our goods,' Mr Geissler said. This week right-wing militants in Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, assaulted hostels for asylum seekers in Cottbus and two other towns. Brandenburg had previously attracted pledges of considerable foreign investment and was held in high esteem among its foreign partners, he said. More than 100 policemen in Cottbus prevented almost as many young extremists on Monday night from assaulting a hostel filled with nearly 1,000 asylum seekers. The youths had attacked the hostel on the previous three nights. Young right-wingers also threw stones at a hostel housing mainly Romanian gypsies near Leipzig who had fled there after their tents were set afire on Sunday. A group of youths also hurled Molotov cocktails and paving stones on Monday night at a hostel for foreigners in Lubz in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The attacks against asylum seekers began there last week in Rostock. The previous night a monument in Berlin to tens of thousands of Jews sent to the death camps by train from 1940 to 1944 was badly damaged by explosives. Mr Eberhard Diepgen, Berlin's Mayor, condemned the attack as an 'ugly provocation.' Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German Interior Minister, announced at an emergency meeting on Monday that Bonn would strongly support the five east German states in setting up special police and surveillance units to combat extremism.
19920901000000000	FT  01 SEP 92 / Troubled city loses its head: Letter from Rostock. Driving northwards to the Baltic city of Rostock, past the placid lakes of the east German coastal countryside, hate and violence seem far away. Even Rostock's city centre, with its tall buildings rising like a red brick cliff along the main street, suggests stability rather than anger, order rather than turmoil. But a few miles from the city in the soulless housing estate of Lichtenhagen, the scars of violence are all too visible. It was here, in sight of the shipyard cranes which testify to the city's former maritime glory and present anxiety, that right-wing extremists threw Molotov cocktails at the building where 20,000 asylum-seekers were housed, prompting widespread condemnation and reawakening ugly memories. It will take a long time for Rostock and its 240,000 inhabitants to live down the ugly events of the past week. 'I'm sad Rostock has got into the press this way,' says a 66-year old pensioner. 'The city where I was born has come into discredit. It's not true that only fascists live here; they are only the minority.' Locals say the vicious rioting which broke out against foreign asylum seekers was the culmination of months of frustration at the inability of local, state, and federal politicians to deal with the problems arising from Germany's generous open-house asylum policy. Even many who condemn the violence, and blame the police for not reacting fast enough, admit that the people of Lichtenhagen - who face immense social and economic changes following unification - were put under extreme pressure. Families of Sinti and Roma gypsies from Romania had occupied a prominent area outside the main shops, pestering passers-by, begging, and allegedly stealing from shop counters. 'Politicians had allowed things to drag on. People here felt molested,' says Steffen Garschke, who runs a shoe repair shop overlooking the scene. The violence perpetrated by right-wing thugs, local youths and extremists from other German towns, erupted during a peaceful demonstration called to draw attention to the problem. It escalated after police failed to stop the first wave of attacks and ended with Vietnamese refugees (against whom there is no real local resentment) being evacuated from a block where they had also come under attack. The roots of this brutality can be traced to the Nazi era, but more recently to the former East German regime and the way it cut off most contact with the outside world. In the past three years, the joy of unification has been replaced by disappointment as the economic gulf between east and west Germany closes only with painful slowness. 'A lot of people don't have jobs here,' says Jurgen Winter, 46, a soldier who does not know whether the German army will still have a place for him next year. 'Only one out of four youngsters can get an apprenticeship. The tendency to violence among 14-year-olds is frightening.' Defenceless foreigners are clearly an easy target, especially in the knowledge that most asylum-seekers are not political but economic refugees. To many in the east, frightened about their own future, foreigners are a scapegoat upon whom most of their ills can be ignorantly blamed. Politicians may have seen this, but action has been slow and calls to alter the constitution to stem the inflow and speed up the asylum process have yet to bring results. In their confusion and mistrust, many in Lichtenhagen applauded and egged on those attacking the asylum hostel. It is this partial complicity in the baiting and attacking of foreigners that the people of Lichtenhagen will find hard to live down. They have had one taste of retribution with the huge left-wing demonstration that swamped the suburb on Saturday. Those watching from balconies were subjected to shouts of 'Nazis out'. More than 3,000 police in full riot gear were on hand. The demonstration drew more than 10,000 people. Although it was fairly peaceful, with none of the feared clashes between right- and left-wing extremists, there was an air of underlying menace. With its traditional strength in shipbuilding, one of the most international of industries, Rostock has certainly not been xenophobic in the past. Even under the communist regime, Cubans and Angolans were employed in industry. At the Warnow yard, north of Lichtenhagen, the giant cranes are a symbol of past strength, present doubts, and hopes for the future. Now, 3,100 people work where 6,000 were once employed. 'The uncertainty over the future is dreadful,' says Holger Haefke, yard spokesman. If Kvaerner, the Norwegian shipping company, does buy the Warnow yard as it has stated, and as many locals hope, the yard's workers will have an assured future, with DM500m of promised investment. There is work until the end of next year, but the presence of four cargo ships - built for the Russians who now cannot afford them - shows how markets have collapsed. Much of east Germany lived off Soviet contracts. Their disappearance is one reason why Rostock lacks confidence in its future. This helps explain - though by no means excuse - the roots of the violence. 'Frustration gradually came to the boil,' Mr Haefke says. 'But it got to a level which can only be condemned.' Unfortunately for Rostock, that condemnation has now assumed worldwide dimensions.
19920829000000000	FT  29 AUG 92 / Rostock violence promptsstate to set up inquiry. THE STATE government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern yesterday set up a special committee to look into the causes of the attacks on foreign asylum seekers in Rostock. However, at the same time the state parliament voted in support of the interior minister, Mr Lothar Kupfer, who had been strongly criticised by the Social Democrats and left wing opposition over his handling of the crisis. It voted to keep Mr Kupfer in office after Mr Berndt Seite, the state prime minister of the east German state, had refused opposition demands that he should be sacked. Although the Rostock suburb of Lichtenhagen, where the attacks occurred among rows of grim modern apartment blocks, was quiet last night, police and officials have braced themselves for fresh outbreaks of protest and possible violence this weekend. Around 2,000 police are ready to stave off any clashes between right wing demonstrators and the up to 10,000 left wingers expected to descend on the Rostock suburb, some way out of the town centre, to express revulsion at the riots. Organisers of the anti-right wing demonstration - under the slogan 'Stop the Pogrom' - said they wanted no incidents. Those joining the march will include trade unionists, members of the Berlin Social Democrats (SPD) and other left wingers. Apart from a few skinheads and youths lounging round the scene of this week's violence, Lichtenhagen was quiet last night. The walls of the apartment block section which had housed asylum seekers are blackened from Molotov Cocktails, windows are broken and burnt grass patches show where police cars were set on fire. Last night, around 1,500 police waited in side-streets in case of violence. Someone had spray-painted the words 'Against Racism' on the wall of the building from where asylum seekers were evacuated a few days ago. Showing that attacks on foreigners are not confined to east Germany, where social and economic pressures are acute, two asylum hostels in the west German state of Lower Saxony were stormed on Thursday night. In one, a fire-bomb was thrown and put out by the inhabitants.
19920827000000000	FT  27 AUG 92 / Leading Article: German raids. THE VIOLENCE against foreigners which has flared since the weekend in the east German port of Rostock is an indication of the trials afflicting unified Germany. Well-drilled gangs of hoodlums, many of them Molotov cocktail-wielding members of extreme rightwing groups, have mounted nightly attacks on accommodation for refugees. In some shameful cases, local townspeople have stood by and applauded. The episodes illustrate the serious tensions caused by the probable influx of 400,000 asylum-seekers into Germany during the whole of 1992. Even though many of the thugs in Rostock came from western Germany, the turmoil shows the inflammable nature of the social tinder in a region struggling with the passage from communism to capitalism. More widely, the unrest underlines the malaise gnawing at the spirit of consensus which has fostered Germany's postwar stability. Two years ago, Germany's parliamentary democracy failed to recognise the full extent of the challenges brought by reunification. Bringing together two unequal parts of a divided country has seriously strained Germany's economic and social fabric. The trouble on the north German coast is a further reminder that the transition still cannot be judged an unqualified success. On the specific question of asylum, Germany is bearing a disproportionate part of the burden in Europe caused by widespread immigration from distressed areas of the former eastern bloc and the third world. Germany needs to change its constitution - as the opposition Social Democrats have now belatedly recognised - to stop misuse of liberal asylum regulations drawn up in the aftermath of the second world war. The problems of housing and feeding large numbers of people seeking solace from foreign hardship have tested social security budgets, as well as the patience of even well-meaning Germans. Many towns have simply run out of hostel space. The country also needs to tighten policing in the increasingly large areas affected by outbreaks of xenophobia during the last year. The east German police, still containing many officers who sustained communist rule for 40 years, lacks authority in many regions east of the Elbe. The Rostock forces of law and order proved remarkably ineffective this week, although reinforcements have been rushed to the city to try to forestall the threat of more attacks in the next few days. Above all, Germany must try to prevent further worsening of a strained climate where sections of the population are only too willing to seek scapegoats for the failures and disappointments of unification. It is up to German politicians to unite a country which is manifestly still divided, rather than to indulge in inter-party bickering. If they fail in that task, the rampage in Rostock will not be the last sign of ugliness along the road to unity.
19920827000000000	FT  27 AUG 92 / Rostock right-wing militants threaten to continue attacks on asylum seekers. RIGHT-WING militants in Rostock yesterday threatened to continue their attacks on asylum seekers and the police until the September 1 anniversary of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland 53 years ago, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. Rostock police said they were taking the warning seriously. The neo-Nazis had boasted that by then they would make Rostock Auslanderfrei, a reference to Nazi Germany's policy of exterminating the Jews in occupied countries. Rioters again fought with police last night and overturned a car. It was the fifth consecutive night of violence. Nerves in the city were at a raw edge after Tuesday's violence. Nearly 800 east German youths supported by neo-Nazis from west Germany threw Molotov cocktails and paving stones at 1,600 policemen. Nearly 70 officers were injured in the clashes, several with severe burns. Ten rioters were arrested, one for the attempted murder of a policeman.
19920826000000000	FT  26 AUG 92 / New racist clash erupts as German politicians quarrel. POLICE clashed with right-wing extremists for a fourth successive night in Rostock at the end of a day in which federal and state leaders quarrelled over who was ultimately responsible for the racist attacks in the east German Baltic port. More than a thousand police reinforcements had been rushed to the city to try to head off the threats of renewed violence. Although most immigrants have been evacuated, several hundred youths outside a refugee centre hurled pieces of pavement and firebombs, at police who responded with water cannon and tear gas. At least two cars were set on fire. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in his first public comment on the riots, said outbreaks of violence against foreigners would be 'confronted with the utmost legal firmness and strictness'. He dismissed charges that the violence was typical for east Germany, the poorer part of the united country. Meanwhile, the federal constitutional protection agency in Cologne said it feared the weekend riots, in which almost 300 asylum-seekers were driven out of a Rostock hostel, would prompt violence elsewhere. Although an instant poll showed 86 per cent of Germans against attacks on foreigners, only 200 people turned out in Rostock yesterday evening for a 'solidarity' rally. Another poll, to be published tomorrow, showed Mr Kohl's Christian Democrat party has lost up to half its support in the east since federal elections in December 1990. In Bonn, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, Mr Kohl's right-hand man, said Rostock had been over-burdened because too many asylum-seekers had been housed in the town's main collection centre. He called on the local authorities and police in future to avoid 'shortcomings' which had done nothing to convince people of the state's ability to cope. He appeared to be referring to Monday night's resumption of the riots in which a mob broke into an apartment block and set several flats alight while police stood by. The police had been unaware that between 60 and 100 Vietnamese were still inside. Mr Schauble, speaking after a meeting of coalition leaders, condemned the violence, called for peaceful cohabitation, and added that east Germany would have to continue to take its quota of asylum-seekers. He also welcomed the opposition Social Democrats' (SPD) apparent acceptance of the need for constitutional change. An SPD summit at the weekend reversed its long-standing policy, saying the flow of asylum seekers had to be 'braked and controlled', and agreeing to constitutional changes 'if necessary'. Mr Gerd Wartenberg, SPD interior policy spokesman, claimed Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, was at fault for housing refugees in Rostock. The minister countered by claiming the SPD had blocked solutions to the asylum problem for years. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Mr Berndt Seite, state prime minister, denied responsibility for the worst example of racist violence since similar events in Hoyerswerda, Lower Saxony, almost a year ago. According to federal officials, 288 violent attacks by right-wingers have occurred so far this year. Nine people have been killed, compared with three in the whole of 1991.
19920826000000000	FT  26 AUG 92 / Eleven words that sentenced Germany to violence: The background to the country's refugee crisis. PERSONS persecuted on political grounds shall enjoy the right to asylum: 11 words in Germany's inadequate constitution, liberally interpreted by politicians, exploited by thousands of poor foreigners looking for a new life, and scorned by blood-hungry yobs and Nazis old and new, brought mass violence to the streets of Rostock at the weekend. The fear and the likelihood is that such scenes will be repeated elsewhere in the coming weeks and months; most likely in the east. The weekend beatings and burnings which spilled over into Monday night - a magnified reflection of the extreme right's offensive in Hoyerswerda, Saxony, almost exactly a year ago - stirred shame and recrimination in equal measure among politicians yesterday. The violence, cheered by mobs of 'respectable' locals in the apartment blocks around the besieged asylum hostel in the Lichtenhagen suburb, also sharpened the desire to find a solution. By grim coincidence, while the alleged radio-equipped 'organisers' of the battle were on their way to Rostock from Berlin, Hamburg and other inner-city spawning grounds of the far-right, Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, was preparing to stand his party's asylum policy on its head. Ringing through the ifs and buts of his weekend declaration came unequivocal acceptance that the uncontrolled flow of asylum-seekers - 233,000 in the first seven months of this year, compared with 256,000 during 1991 and 193,000 in 1990 - had to be stopped. After years of refusal, the party leadership was prepared to countenance constitutional change. The 'ideologues' in Bonn had, after all, heard the voices of grass-roots party leaders in the hundreds of SPD-controlled local and state governments who have daily to house, feed, process and protect asylum claimants, a senior Christian Democrat leader said. Chancellor-candidate Mr Engholm insisted yesterday that he was not trying to protect his career. 'This concerns the political reaction to current problems which need to be dealt with,' he said. One of the problems now in need of treatment has been current since the adoption of the constitution in 1949. Although the 11-word paragraph laying down the basic law on asylum seems clear enough, implementation has been conditioned (by hitherto common consent) by Germany's xenophobic and genocidal past. In practice, anyone asking for asylum at the border is allowed in. After examination of each case, sometimes lasting months, fewer than 5 per cent of applicants are approved. The fact that there are almost 6m foreigners living and working in the federal republic, most for 10 years and more, is often cited to support frequent claims from Bonn politicians that Germany is 'foreigner-friendly'. But most came originally to enjoy better living standards at Germany's convenience. Many were invited as 'guest workers', to dig coal and labour in service jobs spurned by Germans. Now, in the words of Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, people coming in search of a better life 'abuse' the asylum laws. Now, in the words of the extreme right-wing German People's Union, 'Das Boot ist voll (The boat is full).' The recent sudden upsurge in asylum-seekers is exerting unmanageable pressures on local budgets and generating uncontainable social forces, exacerbated by hard-core neo-Nazis and hooligans, especially in unemployment hot-spots in east German towns. The influx of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe (250,000 last year) has added to the strains. Eastern local authorities, lacking funds to provide other accommodation, tend to house their asylum-seeker quotas in heavily populated areas. Protection, such as it is, comes from inexperienced police, mostly new recruits who have inherited the mantle of popular hatred handed down by their communist predecessors. Official jobless figures in such places range around 20 per cent, but estates such as Lichtenhagen house up to another 30 per cent one-time workers, pensioned off into early retirement or 'employed' on non-productive fill-in projects funded by Bonn until real jobs can be found. Now, with recession looming over the western economy and no sign of a resurgence in industrial ruins in the east, the prospect of real jobs is fading - like Chancellor Helmut Kohl's vision of a 'blooming landscape' in the former GDR - into the far distance. A much more tangible possibility is recession, rising unemployment, and mounting social and political disorder. After last weekend's events Bonn may act quickly to slow the flow of immigrants and skim away some of the surface tensions. The risk is that in the process it will expose the underlying roots of dissent. A country still divided economically, socially and mentally - with or without its sad traffic in bemused economic refugees - will continue to provide a bountiful feeding ground for extremists.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ORIGIN OF ASYLUM SEEKERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1991              1991*           1992**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yugoslavia            74,854             14,734           72,415 Rumania               40,504             11,899           29,208 Turkey                23,877             10,583           13,314 Bulgaria              12,056              3,500            5,984 Vietnam                8,133              3,293            5,577  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Last six months   ** First six months  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Interior Ministry  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
19920825000000000	FT  25 AUG 92 / Rightwing riots test Bonn's policy on asylum-seekers. RIGHTWING extremists clashed with police and set fire to a refugee hostel in the east German city of Rostock last night, as violence against foreign asylum-seekers erupted for the third night in a row. The rioting, evoking memories of Nazi violence against Jews, has caused deep embarrassment in Germany. 'These events are hurting Germany's image in the world,' said Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, who flew to Rostock for talks with the city's leaders. About 200 asylum-seekers, mostly gypsies from Romania, were moved out of the hostel yesterday afternoon under heavy police escort. But hours later hundreds of young demonstrators threw fire-bombs at the building, setting part of it ablaze. Dozens of Vietnamese refugees were inside the building when the fire broke out but were rescued, according to ZDF television. Police fought the crowd with water cannons and tear gas in a repeat of clashes that shook the city at the weekend. A throng of local residents watched the street battles, some of them cheering the right-wing militants. Police said extremists had driven to Rostock from Berlin, Hamburg and other cities in convoys and had used radio to co-ordinate their attacks. The violence, condemned by the Bonn government, has been spawned by a growing feeling that Germany cannot afford to keep its door open to large numbers of asylum-seekers, many seeking a more prosperous life rather than a haven from political persecution. Tension has been building up for weeks in Rostock, once Communist East Germany's showcase city but now blighted by unemployment. Many harbour and shipyard workers have lost their jobs and feel forgotten in the united Germany. Deprivation and resentment have turned the area into fertile ground for rightwing extremists' xenophobic message. The lastest trouble also partly results from mishandling of the steady stream of asylum-seekers. The hostel in Rostock-Lichtenberg, with just 300 places, could not cope with the numbers arriving. More than 100 people, many of them Romanian gypsies, camped on a lawn opposite apartment blocks and sanitary conditions became intolerable. 'People who camp out in front of other people's homes arouse aggression,' said Mr Lothar Kupfer, a minister in the state government. His conclusion was the same as that of a growing number of German politicians, who fear a backlash from ordinary citizens in east and west. 'Germany must quickly bar the uncontrolled entry of foreigners,' he said. At the weekend, the opposition SPD leadership, under pressure from state authorities, announced an about-turn in their policy on asylum-seekers, saying that immigration must be 'braked and controlled'.
19920824000000000	FT  24 AUG 92 / SPD about-turn on asylum seekers: New stance on use of German forces in UN-led operations. GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats (SPD) announced surprising about-turns at the weekend on two of the most delicate policy areas plaguing the Bonn government: asylum-seekers and the use of German forces in UN-led military operations. Bowing to grass-roots demand and risking a rift with his party's left wing, Mr Bjorn Engholm, party leader, said immigration must be 'braked and controlled'. The party was ready to approve a change in the constitution if necessary. Some 240,000 asylum-seekers took advantage of Germany's liberal laws in the first seven months of this year, arriving at the rate of one a minute during July. Last year's total was a record 256,000. Most are seeking work in Europe's richest country and have, by law, to be housed and fed by local authorities and individual state governments. Mr Engholm has come under pressure from state authorities, most of them SPD-controlled, for a change of course. In future, he said after a private meeting of party leaders, people arriving and giving no reason, or false reasons, in their request for asylum should be excluded. Those from countries where there was no political persecution, should also be turned away. Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, welcomed the change, though it had come 'late'. Leaders of the main coalition parties, the Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union, demanded an immediate start to talks on constitutional change. The SPD also renounced its opposition to the use of German forces in international military actions under the UN flag. Mr Engholm called for UN reform, so it as a whole, not just 'three or four states', took responsibility for policing world peace. That could be achieved in a few years. Meanwhile, the party was ready to 'decide on' German military participation in the case of 'unforeseen conflicts'. The decision on use of the military is partly a response to divisions within the SPD over the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The constitution is vague on the use of German forces, but has been interpreted by all parties as banning deployment outside the Nato area. But the government has pressed for a more liberal interpretation to allow an enlarged Germany to fulfil its international obligations. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, said he had already drafted an amendment to clarify the constitutional issue, which also laid down conditions for out-of-area involvement. These included deployment only of volunteers, under UN command and only after an examination of each case by the Bundestag. Several hundred right-wingers attacked a hostel for foreign refugees in the east German port city of Rostock yesterday and fought police for the second night in a row, Reuter reports from Rostock.
19920814000000000	FT  14 AUG 92 / Foreigners suffer sharp rise in attacks. THE German government yesterday said that the root cause of a sharp increase in right-wing attacks against foreigners was the recent surge in the number of asylum-seekers in Germany. Presenting a catalogue of violence assembled by constitutional protection agencies which include the secret service, Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, said neo-fascist and extreme right-wing attacks against foreigners in Germany increased more than 500 per cent last year. Although the escalation has since slowed, a government report released yesterday indicates an increasing level of violence. Seven people have been killed in the first seven months of this year, compared with three during 1991. About 30 per cent of the 650 assaults so far counted involved arson or explosives. Bombs or fire were used in 383 of the 1,483 attacks recorded last year. Referring to the rise of the right in France, Italy and elsewhere, he said the problem was not uniquely German. Democracy was not in danger from the estimated 39,800 extreme right-wingers in Germany at the end of last year, he claimed. The figure includes 4,200 loosely organised neo-Nazi skinheads ' 3,000 of them in eastern Germany ' registered in Mr Seiter's annual report for the first time as a separate grouping. According to recent estimates there are around 6m foreigners living and working in Germany. The main targets for attack, however, are asylum-seekers. More than 45,000 arrived in July, swelling the year's total to 233,000 compared with 256,000 for the whole of 1991. Membership of the German People's Union, DVU, one of the extremist parties which drew international attention recently when it won seats in the Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein state elections, grew by 2,000 last year to 24,000, the report said. The far-right Republicans, which have also made big gains, are under active observation by state authorities, the report said.
19920805000000000	FT  05 AUG 92 / Germany faces huge increase in number of asylum seekers. ASYLUM SEEKERS poured into Germany last month at the rate of more than one a minute, overburdening resources, threatening goodwill and straining the patience of Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister. Announcing a record influx of 46,496 people - bringing the total for the year so far to 233,000, against 256,000 in the whole of 1991 - Mr Seiters appealed yesterday for the Social Democrat party opposition 'finally to open the way for a change in the constitution to stop the uncontrolled flow'. Abuse of the existing law, which obliges immigration officials to allow in anyone claiming asylum, limited Germany's ability to help people in real need: the victims of war, terror and violence, the minister said. Of the more than 130,000 claims examined so far this year, only 4.3 per cent had been approved as genuine cases of people fleeing political persecution, Mr Seiters added. The SPD, reinforced by allies among the Liberal Democrats, junior partners in the Bonn coalition, has long resisted constitutional change, which requires approval in the SPD-dominated Bundesrat, the upper house. The local authorities face increasing difficulties in handling the flood. Yesterday, 200 police raided a 'collection hostel' in a former barracks near Stuttgart. Four people were arrested and charged with drug offences and burglary. Five were found to have several sets of identity papers. Around 180 of the 390 people registered as resident in the hostel had disappeared. In Schleswig-Holstein, 140 asylum seekers, who fled from neighbouring Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Monday to escape harassment from rightwing extremists, were told they would be returned forcibly if they did not go back voluntarily. There has been no repetition so far this year of the large-scale violence which flared last autumn after a concerted skinhead attack on a hostel in Hoyerswerda, Saxony. But there are regular reports of assault on foreigners, and popular discontent appears to be mounting. Mr Seiters pointed out that, of last month's 10,700 asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia, fewer than 1,000 came from areas where civil war is taking place. Ethnic cleansing, Page 2
19921103000000000	FT  03 NOV 92 / Kohl may seek curbs on asylum. GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl may introduce emergency laws to limit the influx of asylum-seekers if the governing coalition and the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) fail to reach agreement on how to deal with the problem, according to government officials. SPD officials accused Mr Kohl of planning a coup from above, saying that any new measures limiting the right to asylum would be unconstitutional and would undermine the 1949 Basic Law which says the granting of asylum is a basic right for those who are persecuted. A change in the Basic Law requires a constitutional amendment, which must be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament, thus needing the support of the SPD. The SPD, which yesterday said it might support greater controls on the borders, is becoming increasingly divided over the issue in the run-up to its annual conference later this month. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, supports an amendment to the constitution, but grass-roots membersreject this on the grounds that it amounts to supporting those in the ruling coalition who favour new curbs on immigration and refugee status. The measures proposed by the governing Christian Democrat-led coalition would allow officials the right to reject immediately applicants who cannot prove they are being repressed or persecuted. Mr Kohl's proposals coincide with growing pressure on the SPD to take a stand on the immigration issue, and with the publication of figures which showed a record monthly influx of 48,985 foreigners seeking political asylum last month. The number of asylum-seekers fleeing to Germany swelled to 450,000 for the first 10 months of this year, compared with 120,000 in the whole of 1990, and 256,000 in 1991. The greatest number came from Poland and Romania. Mr Kohl is under pressure from the right wing of the Christian Social Union in the coalition, and from the nationalist Republican party, which want greater curbs on those wishing to seek refuge in, or the right to emigrate to, Germany, even though only 5 per cent of asylum applicants are granted such status.
19921026000000000	FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (15): Tensions rise as the economy weakens  -The immigration issue / National self-confidence is wavering amid economic uncertainty. THERE is a popular belief in Germany, fostered by social affairs experts, that the rise of the extreme right does not offer any danger to democracy. Backed up by continuous assurances, notably from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that Germany is 'foreigner-friendly,' it rings increasingly hollow as the tally of killings, fire-bombings, and less overt signs of xenophobia increases. The number of attacks by right-wing extremists rose more than five-fold in 1991, and is continuing to go up this year. Although the level of violence has eased since the August riots in Rostock on the Baltic coast in the former GDR, the wave of antipathy rolls on. Swelled by regular media reports which splash headlines on the number of crimes committed by 'foreigners,' and politicians making capital out of the alleged costs of housing, feeding and processing refugees, it has developed a momentum which government has been unable to dissipate. Most recent public attention has been focused on physical attacks on Roumanians and other registered asylum-seekers in eastern Germany, but the malaise has spread deeper and further. The defacement of Jewish monuments and memorials is once again commonplace. The so-called Jewish barracks in the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp was burned down in late September. Earlier this month, right-wing extremists attacked a Greek school in Wuppertal. Expatriate staff of foreign companies have been tutored on how to dress and behave to avoid abuse or worse. Meanwhile, thousands of hapless asylum-seekers continue to press into Germany through gateways opened up by the country's liberal asylum laws. Under the traditional interpretation of the so-called basic law, or constitution, anyone arriving in Germany asking for political asylum must be admitted and his or her case investigated. This has long been interpreted as a carte blanche for economic refugees from all over the world to make a bid for a better life in Germany. The long-term steady flow has turned to a flood following unification, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the opening of Germany's eastern borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia, and war in the former Yugoslavia. Recent monthly registrations of asylum-seekers have exceeded one a minute. By August the total for the year so far already matched the 256,000 who arrived in 1991. Forecasts of 400,000 at most during 1992 were revised upwards towards 500,000. On today's acceptance rates, fewer than 5 per cent of the total will be allowed to remain as genuine asylum cases. But all will be processed through the lengthy and meticulous procedures set out by the interior ministry and the constitutional court. All will be distributed around the country - each Land or region allocated assorted groups according to a strict quota system - and all will be housed, fed and clothed at an estimated monthly cost of DM1,400 each. Debt-laden local authorities, struggling with a national housing shortage, and police and social services increasingly claim they can no longer cope. Beyond the street battles, the signal failure of policy-makers and administrators to deal with the problem has led to widespread popular cynicism and loss of support for leaders of all the mainstream parties. Indications of possible future trends have included the winning of seats in the Schleswig-Holstein parliament by the racist German People's Union, and the installation of a powerful voting bloc in the Baden-Wurttemberg legislature for the far-right Republican party, led by Mr Franz Schonhuber, a former Waffen-SS officer. While vox pop soundings suggest that the vast majority of Germans despise and are shamed by the regular outbursts of violence, other, more detailed investigations show up considerable antipathy to foreigners. A recent study by the Cologne Institute of Empirical Psychology, which involved more than 2,000 people between the ages of 16 and 24, showed that a third admitted to being antagonistic towards non-Germans or at least harbouring xenophobic thoughts. A finding that is possibly even more significant is that only 25 per cent of the sample believed there should be no discrimination of any kind against foreigners. A broader sampling in early September by the respected Infas institute reported 25 per cent supporting repatriation of foreigners, and a good 50 per cent agreeing that 'Germany belongs to the Germans.' The sheer volume of foreign faces, often concentrated in run-down, heavily-populated areas, and the proliferation of habits alien to the disciplined Germans, is producing unmanageable tensions at a time when the economy is weakening rapidly. National self-confidence is wavering under the influences of economic uncertainty, the realisation that the dream of unification is a potential nightmare, and the impact of international condemnation of the violence on Germans' self-esteem. The reactions of national political leaders, far from countering the uncertainty, have in fact reflected it in magnified form. Wide cross-party consensus is essential for any change to the basic law, but until recently government and opposition policies have been in turmoil. The three-party ruling coalition earlier this month healed its three-way split and agreed a compromise reform plan. Returning to Bonn after the summer, the SPD leadership raised hopes of progress when it apparently gave up its long-standing ideological resistance to any reduction of refugees' rights. Mr Bjorn Engholm, party chief, declared himself ready to negotiate with government on constitutional amendments. But within weeks the regional membership was pressing party leaders to change tack once again, and promising chancellor-candidate Mr Engholm an uncomfortable time at the next party assembly in November. But his discomfort will be minor compared with the tribulations of the beleaguered refugees. As long as international and domestic economic conditions deteriorate and the flow of newcomers continues without clear initiatives from Bonn, so the potential among native Germans for resentment and violence seems likely to grow. The so-called 'asylum problem' has developed into Germany's most pressing domestic political and social challenge. It has fostered the re-emergence of the far right as a potent political power throughout the country and damaged the east's hopes of winning vital foreign investment. It has also put the German people at odds with themselves - and the watching world.
19921026000000000	FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (11): Imbalance between young and old - Population trends / Births down 40 per cent in the east. ECONOMICALLY speaking, a child is a costly luxury. No longer do people need to breed to ensure that they are looked after in old age or to engender a home-grown workforce for the fields. Emotional factors alone ensure that people continue to have children. This is a phenomenon of all urbanised, modern industrial societies, but the consequences are felt particularly acutely in Germany, the third least fertile country in the European Community after Italy and Spain: Germany's population is growing old, and it would be shrinking but for an influx of foreigners. Expressed in pictorial form, a population ought to look like a pyramid: a broad base of younger people supporting a dwindling number of older ones. Germany's population now looks more like a Christmas tree, the pyramid thinned out by the effects of two world wars, but 40 years from now, the picture will look less balanced: an inverse pyramid where relatively few young people support layers of older people. 'For the present generation simply to replace itself, 40 per cent of all married couples need to have three or more children,' says Professor Charlotte Hohn, director of the Wiesbaden-based Federal Institute for Population Research. 'But in a society such as ours, most people want to have one child - or two, at the most.' Germany's reunification has highlighted the growing numerical imbalance between young and old: in 1991, the number of births in reunited Germany fell back by 8.5 per cent, from 906,000 in 1990 to 828,000, a drop caused by a huge, 40 per cent reduction of births in the former east Germany. A combination of social unease, migration to the western part of Germany, plus growing job opportunities, has meant that young women in the ex-DDR have been reluctant to have children, and hospitals in the east report a surge in demand for abortions and sterilisations. The resulting demographic problem is often cited as one of the more serious difficulties facing Germany in the years to come: Germans have the highest wages, take the longest holidays, work the shortest hours of their peers in other industrial countries - and to cap it all there are set to be fewer people at work to support a disproportionately large elderly population. The government has taken a number of steps to mitigate the problem, for example raising the retirement age and adjusting old-age healthcare insurance regulations. But this is not enough: in order to shore up the imbalanced population pyramid, Germany will have to rely more heavily on imported labour. That the working population of the former west Germany climbed from 28.6m to 29.4m between January and October last year reflects migration from the former DDR as well as the influx of ethnic Germans (Aussiedler), predominantly from the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, who are entitled to German citizenship. But more jobs were lost in east Germany than were created in the west and if the workforce is to grow across the whole of Germany, the number of foreigners living in Germany will have to expand, as it did in the last decade when a net 2.2m people migrated into Germany. Over the longer term the number of foreigners in Germany will grow anyway: the 5.4m-strong foreign community in Germany now is expected to grow to 8.9m over the next 40 years, without immigration. Although not German citizens, these foreigners - predominantly Turks - have come to look on Germany as home and, having paid their taxes, are entitled to the same care in old age as other Germans. Senior industrialists already recognise the imperative of attracting more skilled immigrants into Germany: some 230,000 apprenticeships are unfilled and in united Germany there are over 400,000 job vacancies for skilled manual workers. Employers and employee associations bend over backwards to say they would welcome qualified applicants for these jobs, whatever their nationality, and Mr Rudolf Stumpf, personnel director of BMW, has said that the car company may as well shut if it were not for its foreign workers. At a time when the number of ethnic Germans will be shrinking, this growth may exacerbate social tensions which are already to be felt in the early 1990s in the attacks against asylum homes in the east of Germany. It is an irony that asylum seekers are not allowed to work even though there would be jobs for them: they are obliged to sit around doing nothing for months at the state's expenses while they wait for a decision on their asylum application, serving to stoke up resentments within the communities in the midst of whom they are billeted. As Mr Heiner Geissler, deputy chairman of the ruling CDU-CSU coalition pointed out this summer in the wake of the attacks, more tolerance is required and Germans will have to get used to living and working in an increasingly multi-racial society.
19921211000000000	FT  11 DEC 92 / Raids on neo-Nazi suspects. HUNDREDS of police in six German states raided the homes and offices of suspected neo-Nazis yesterday, as the government stepped up its crackdown on racist violence and right-wing extremism. Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, banned a second neo-Nazi organisation, the German Alternative (DA), and the federal prosecutor arrested two members of a self-styled militia group, called the 'Werewolf Hunting Unit'. The moves came as Chancellor Helmut Kohl led the German parliament in its strongest and most united condemnation of the rash of racist attacks on foreigners and asylum-seekers' hostels. The number of attacks on foreigners has risen from 2,462 last year, to 4,587 recorded so far this year, according to the federal criminal investigation office. Mr Kohl said the country was facing a 'terrifying increase in violence', in which there was no justification for anyone to indulge in violence. Mr Seiters denounced the DA as a neo-Nazi organisation particularly active in eastern Germany. Police immediately launched raids on the homes and offices of an estimated 300 members in Berlin, Brandenburg, and Saxony, in the east, and Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and the Rhineland-Palatinate in west Germany. The organisation was to contest local elections in east Germany, and propaganda documents, as well as a motley arsenal of weapons such as a sawn-off air rifle and a starting pistol, were seized in the raids.
19921208000000000	FT  08 DEC 92 / Bonn parties find compromise to calm asylum row. THE German parliament is expected to pass controversial legislation aimed at curbing the influx of foreigners and at the same time dilute the growing influence of extreme-right groups which have exploited widespread concern over the asylum issue to call for racist policies. The draft proposals will go before the Bundestag when it reconvenes after Christmas. They were thrashed out between the conservative government coalition and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) at the weekend and still retain the individual right to asylum, as guaranteed in article 16 of the constitution. But draft amendments include the right to send back 'manifestly unfounded cases' to a third country. The third countries include Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria and Switzerland, all of which have borders with Germany. Border guards, for instance, will be able to decide, often on the spot, whether to prevent individuals from entering the country, even if they invoke article 16. Mr Walter Koisser, head of the Bonn office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, yesterday said that if any person was sent back to Poland, the conditions for appeal, housing, infrastructure, and for guaranteeing the safety of the applicant, do not yet exist. 'Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are young democracies. They have signed the Geneva Convention on Refugees, but they do not have the legislation which can translate the convention into practice,' he said. 'I really do not think that they are geared up towards dealing with a massive number of cases who will be turned back at the German border.' Germany, for instance, has already a backlog of 450,000 cases. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said yesterday that Germany would provide financial assistance for those sent to a third country. Over the past year, economic refugees, and genuine refugees, particularly gypsies from Romania and Bulgaria, have been repatriated. 'We want to make Germany a less attractive place for economic refugees,' the spokesman said. But he admitted that it was unclear how the proposals would stem illegal immigration, which exceeds 100,000 people a year. The proposals, which are also designed to speed the administrative procedures, will still allow the courts in Germany to decide if an asylum seeker is a legitimate applicant. If an asylum claim is rejected, the applicant will be returned to a third country, where an appeal can be lodged. However, SPD and UN officials want assurances that those countries will not repatriate asylum-seekers. With the case of those fleeing civil war, the governing conservative Christian Democratic Union, the conservative Christian Social Union, its sister party in Bavaria, the liberal Free Democrats, and the SPD went some way towards giving these people - many from the former Yugoslavia - a special status which will entitle them to the right of temporary residence in Germany without applying for political asylum. The SPD and the FDP said the amendments to the asylum law were only part of a long process towards integrating the country's 6.2m foreigners.
19921203000000000	FT  03 DEC 92 / Germany's citizenship challenge: The hurdles placed in the way of those seeking naturalisation. OBTAINING German citizenship is largely a question of German blood, said Mr Michael Schlikker a 31-year-old legal expert at the Federal Office for Problems of Foreigners. Leafing through a heavy tome, he finds article 5.7 of the 1913 Reichs- und Staatsangehorigkeitsgesetz, or Imperial and State Citizenship Law 'Through birth, one can acquire citizenship if the legitimate child has a German parent; and if an illegitimate child has a German mother ..' This short article means that the 6.2m foreigners in Germany have little chance of obtaining German citizenship. Yet as the government and the opposition Social Democratic Party prepare to resume talks on amending the country's liberal asylum laws to curb the influx of foreigners, there is a growing consensus that what Germany really needs is an immigration law. Many legal experts believe that without such a law, there is little chance of integrating foreigners into German society, and the possibility of social unrest could increase. Under current regulations, there are some opportunities to obtain German citizenship. For instance, if a Russian marries an ethnic German, and both decide to live in Germany, the ethnic German, or Aussiedler has by law the automatic right to German citizenship, and the Russian can be naturalised almost immediately. However, if a Russian (or any other nationality) marries a German in Germany, remains married for two years, and lives without interruption for five years in the country, only then can he or she apply for citizenship. There is still no guarantee that the application will be successful. To obtain citizenship, the spouse must have no criminal record, a job, a fixed abode, fluency in German, and a knowledge of German culture. A foreigner who is not married to a German, must meet these conditions as well. In addition, he or she must have lived in Germany for 10 years before lodging an application. After a further five years, when the heavy weight of German bureaucracy will have run its full course, the foreigner will be naturalised. But in common with all applications, original citizenship must be renounced because Germany does not allow dual citizenship. In recent years, some concessions have been made toward integrating the children of the Gastarbeiter - those invited to Germany in the early 1960s to make up the labour shortfall. However, children born in Germany of non-German parents can only apply for citizenship between the ages of 16 and 23, again under certain conditions. These include residence in Germany for at least eight years, the renouncing of previous citizenship, and six years at a German school. Ms Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, head of the foreigners office, says many Turkish teenagers want citizenship but their parents prefer them to retain Turkish citizenship. 'Its disgraceful that we make it so difficult for them to become German citizens. They will always regard themselves as foreigners,' she added. Refugees who have recognised refugee status in Germany, which means that they can live and work in the country, are confronted with a maze of obstacles before they can gain citizenship. 'The refugee has no legal entitlement to citizenship,' said Mr Walter Brill, a legal officer at the Bonn-based United Nations High Commission for Refugees. 'It is discretionary. There is never really a situation where the applicant has fulfilled all the conditions for citizenship because it is not stated in the law,' he added. Moreover, even if the refugee's application is treated favourably, there is another hurdle: original citizenship must be renounced. This is often difficult because the applicant must seek permission from those same authorities which forced the applicant to flee in the first place. Mr Brill agrees that it is time for Germany to introduce an immigration law which would give foreigners easier access to citizenship and political rights. 'The climate is finally changing,' he said. But Mr Schlikker still wonders if the right wing of the German establishment is prepared to dilute German blood as the price for an ethnically heterogeneous society.
19921202000000000	FT  02 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Violent times in Germany. HAVING MADE a unique and exemplary postwar recovery as a land cleaved in two, Germany is now navigating a unique and less-than-exemplary passage as a reunited nation. One feature of this passage has been a spate of attacks on foreigners, culminating in last week's firebomb murder of a Turkish woman and two young girls in a north German village. The German people, and their neighbours, are right to be concerned, not least because the thugs behind the latest outrage signed off their telephone message to the police with the words 'Heil Hitler'. Germany has a problem which requires a strategy. This must extend beyond short-term law-and-order measures into a domain to which Chancellor Helmut Kohl has thus far refrained from according much attention: an overall policy which aims both at improving controls on immigration and achieving genuine integration of the 4.5m foreign residents in Germany's midst. 'This republic is not Weimar,' Mr Kohl declared - rightly - last week. German security experts have been warning for months that right-wing gangs, some led by shaven-headed youths mouthing ideologies which everyone hoped had gone for good in 1945, have been gaining strength in both east and west. Yet the danger is neither that German democracy will tumble into the abyss, nor that the country is succumbing to excessive nationalism. Rather, there are three risks - all of them definable and containable. First, the perpetrators of the disorder may become branded abroad as epitomes of the new Germany. This would greatly harm Germany's image and eventually its economy. Second, the spectre of politicians expressing futile alarm at extremists' misdeeds will damage the stock of the country's leadership, at a time when Germany needs effective government. Third, if assaults on foreigners continue, the spore of insecurity will spread. The left-wing terrorism which afflicted Germany during the 1970s and 1980s was mainly aimed at selected establishment targets. The new neo-Nazi groupings are less discriminating. They seek their victims not behind the portals of bankers' villas, but on suburban railway stations. The reasons for resentment against people with dark skins are manifold. Perceptions that foreigners are responsible for crime, unemployment or social security fraud have increased with the rise in asylum seekers entering Germany, and in the strains engendered by unification. Brutality is not a purely German phenomenon. Germany registered 2,427 'criminal acts against foreigners' last year, against 246 in 1990. In England and Wales, the Home Office counted 7,780 'racially motivated attacks' in 1991, against 6,559 in 1990. The German experience is exceptional not simply because of the acceleration since 1990, but because of the country's history - including its lack of success in integrating foreigners. One positive move is that Mr Kohl is now on track for a deal with the opposition Social Democrats on amending the constitution to prevent abuses of Germany's liberal asylum law. Although it is unedifying that politicians act under the pressure of Molotov cocktails, this is a welcome step. But it will serve little purpose unless more is done elsewhere. Naturalisation procedures for foreigners need to be made less onerous - crucially, permitting long-stay Gastarbeiter and their offspring to vote in elections and become German citizens. These would-be new Germans need full rights under the law, buttressed by the sort of initiatives which have helped other societies absorb ethnic minorities. Germany needs a multiracial police force, and banks and department stores which give jobs mainly to Germans should hire more German-speaking foreigners. The violence is a challenge not simply for police and politicians, but for Germany's civil society. If the policies and determination are there, it will pass the test.
