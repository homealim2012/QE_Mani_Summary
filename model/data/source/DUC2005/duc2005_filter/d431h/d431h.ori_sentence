New Successful Applications of Robot Technology What new applications of robot technology are in current use successfully.
PARENTS LOOKING for help keeping young guests happy and entertained during a birthday party will find many companies and individuals who furnish clowns pony rides and cartoon characters.
A few offer distinctive services for an out of the ordinary birthday experience.
Parties by Panda monium will deliver a gym with apparatus including mats a rolling donut air log tumbling mats and ball pit.
Two staff members lead the activities and spot for safety.
Parties can be suited for toddlers or junior gymnasts or for physically or mentally handicapped children.
"wet" parties with water balloons and three educational magic shows.
provides a dancing spinning robot who gives rides and plays hide and seek.
The robot projects children s voices to sound like such characters as John Wayne and Alvin the Chipmunk or anything in between.
older youngsters may be permitted to operate the robot s controls.
Dance on Wheels does custom designed parties such as a "Dirty Dancing" party or a 50s theme party.
Children can be anything from hatching dinosaur eggs to tea party guests dressed in antique clothing.
Sugar Free Fun Catering offers a variety of cakes and ice cream sweetened without refined sugar or artificial sweetners.
The company often joins forces with Dance on Wheels but either can be retained individually.
For something entirely different The Lizard Lady brings her traveling reptile petting zoo.
After introducing children to each lizard or snake she invites the youngsters to hold the animal.
Many kids and even some adults like to "wear" Sheila an 8 foot python.
Parties for Panda monium based in Canoga Park charges about 200 for a one hour event.
in Costa Mesa is 125 per hour for the first two hours.
Dance on Wheels and Sugar Free Fun Catering are located in Van Nuys.
Dance on Wheels charges 120 and up for a one to one and a half hour theme party.
one half gallon of homemade ice cream is 15.
The Lizard Lady in Van Nuys charges 100 and up for a 50 minute presentation.
It is an epochal chapter in the long history of human exploration.
24 the spacecraft Voyager 2 will pass within 3 000 miles of the planet Neptune s cloud enshrouded north pole.
At that moment 12 years and 4 days into its historic flight nearly 3 billion miles from its home the craft will again share with the men who sent it the sights no one has ever seen.
Voyager the most sophisticated robot ever built consists of 65 000 different parts and a computer so sophisticated that it can heal itself when damage threatens its mission.
But on that day of man s first encounter with the most distant of the outer solar system s great planets the craft will be so far from Earth that even though they travel at the speed of light its photographic transmissions home will take 4 hours and 6 minutes to reach the network of 38 antennas on four continents arrayed to receive them.
Voyager is the greatest in a series of unmanned space probes whose accomplishments are unique in the annals of man s exploration of his physical universe.
Their journeys over almost unimaginable distances are adventures of the human mind but not of the human body.
Theirs are the feats of daring intellects and dazzling ingenuity and not of the body s courage or endurance as all such stories of exploration in far places have been before.
Those of a romantic bent might argue that while Voyager has stored up scientific treasure it has done little to enrich the human spirit that the project s triumphal elevation of the machine has degraded mankind from an explorer to a consumer of exploration.
That we think is a narrow even vulgar view one that reduces adventure to mere sensation and exploration to a kind of trial by combat.
Voyager in all its magnificent accomplishment is but the latest reminder of the fact that in all things that really matter what man s mind can grasp far exceeds the reach of his frail body.
CSUN TO TURN NEW PAGE WITH ROBOTIC LIBRARY.
Plans for the new east wing of the Cal State Northridge library at first do not seem very user friendly considering that they include shelves too high to reach bad lighting and a lot of noisy equipment.
Even worse all of the more than 500 000 books there will be kept in random order.
But what sounds like a librarian s nightmare will work fine for the mechanical staffers of what will be the world s first fully automated library where robots will roam the aisles replacing and retrieving books California State University officials say.
They say human hands will be no match for Leviathan II the 2 million state of the art automation system under construction at the San Fernando Valley campus.
When it is finished system designers say Leviathan will hold 12 times the number of books per cubic foot as in a conventional library allowing librarians to store the least used of CSUN s million volume collection in a fraction of the space the books now occupy.
Patrons of the computerized card catalogue will at the push of a button command a team of six robots that can find a bin of books and bring it to the checkout counter in about five minutes.
University officials estimate that the system named after the biblical whale that "retrieved" Jonah will save taxpayers millions of dollars in library construction costs and hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in operating costs.
Leviathan works in the dark does not litter and requires no heat.
5 million library expansion project to be completed in the fall of 1991.
Because only robots will be allowed to work in the Leviathan section students and faculty will not be able to browse through the shelves of books a practice that most agree is a fundamental component of research.
But if it works Leviathan could be the answer for other university and research libraries faced with growing collections and dwindling space and money.
Officials at the Library of Congress and Harvard University say librarians everywhere will be watching the CSUN experiment.
"Libraries can t grow indefinitely " said Michael Shelly a special projects director at the Library of Congress which is expected to outgrow its Capitol Hill facility in three years.
Holden curator of the Harvard University archives said at the CSUN system because if it works But skeptics who include mostly academicians who prefer retrieving books themselves say CSUN s Leviathan could just as easily turn out to be a white elephant.
said Leonard Pitt who has been a CSUN history professor for 27 years.
The critics point to a similar mechanical book storage system that failed badly during an experimental run in the early 1970s.
said Nola Hartman a reference librarian at the Monroe County Library in Bloomington Ind.
It later cost taxpayers about 250 000 to remove the system called a Randtreiver and convert its area for more conventional use.
Besides the frequent mechanical breakdowns it used giant magnets to lift metal book bins and place them on a conveyor belt the system was inefficient because it could only be operated by specially trained library workers.
But robotics technology has advanced dramatically since then say supporters of the CSUN plan.
Advanced computer controlled retrieval systems are working well at hundreds of industry warehouses including the world s largest such system in use for several years at the Ralphs Grocery Co.
There robots retrieve pallets of groceries weighing hundreds of pounds that are loaded by human hands onto trucks bound for area stores.
builders of the Ralphs system are also building the CSUN system.
The firm is eager to prove that Leviathan will work and expects the idea to catch on at other universities.
Thomas Harris director of library affairs for the Cal State University system and one of two men credited with pushing the idea said he believes that the system will work and eventually be tried at other Cal State campuses.
The biggest drawback to the automated setup is that researchers will be unable to walk through the aisles.
Books stored in the automated system will be available only to the robots which are modified forklifts with mechanical arms.
The robots will travel on rails in a narrow path between 100 foot long aisles separating stacks of book bins that are 40 feet high.
All of the volumes will have a computer bar code that tells Leviathan where to find them or whether they have been checked out making formal arrangement by subject unnecessary.
Friedman a Fullbright scholar and attorney who also holds a doctorate in political economy from MIT.
Other experts in the field of library automation such as UCLA mathematics professor Robert M.
Hayes agree that browsing is a key element in the search for information.
said Hayes considered a pioneer in information science for the last 35 years.
Hayes however said universities because of rising construction costs have no choice but to try experiments such as the one at CSUN.
Without the technology the nation s major universities which are doubling their library collections every 15 to 20 years would be buried in their books.
Almost everyone in the field agrees that such systems are a compromise between academic and economic demands.
said Richard Boss a library automation consultant to the Office of the President as well as the Boston and Los Angeles public libraries.
Common among the nation s larger libraries are computerized card catalogue systems that list available book titles when library patrons use a terminal to enter either the subject or author they are seeking.
CSUN patrons will be able to operate Leviathan using the school s existing computerized card catalogue system.
Library administrators of the University of California system say they ran into similar opposition during planning for two book storage facilities at Richmond Calif.
These traditional facilities employ library workers to shelve books.
The facilities advantage officials say is that they save space at individual libraries by storing the overflow of volumes from the system s nine campuses in two places.
said Kay Loughman head of user services for the system s northern regional library storage facility.
Norman Tanis CSUN s dean of libraries said Leviathan will be much quicker and more efficient than the University of California s method.
Columbia s astronauts mopped up water from a leaky dehumidifier today as they closed in on the floating science laboratory they plan to pluck from space Friday with the shuttle s robot arm.
Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee executed three engine firing maneuvers today putting Columbia on a near collision course with the satellite they have been chasing since they were launched Tuesday onto a path 1 725 miles behind their quarry.
Once the astronauts move in on the 11 ton target they will fly in formation 35 feet away while mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar reaches out with Columbia s 50 foot mechanical arm to snare the 30 foot satellite which is as large as a small school bus.
The shuttle this morning was reported to be within 300 miles of the satellite known as the Long Duration Exposure Facility.
Brandenstein and mission specialist David Low interrupted their flight plans for more than two hours today to cope with the leak of about two gallons of water shown on television as a slow bubbling of water beads.
They shut off the faulty dehumidifier shifted to a backup and then went to work on the water with towels and a hand held vacuum using a flashlight to dry cables and other surfaces.
Loose water which forms beads and globules in weightlessness can interfere with electronics.
Looking at all the equipment that had to be moved to get at the water Brandenstein remarked Scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how various systems and materials withstood the long stay in orbit information that will help in designing the space station and other space vehicles.
Put them in a room together and you can see the electricity at work.
But the only one they are supposed to seduce is the American consumer.
The two are androids computerized mannequins designed to look gesture and "talk" like real people and the plan is to use them to grab attention and provide information at stores museums conference halls and trade shows.
Recently several firms have gotten into the business of supplying computerized mannequins and other types of portable robots for retail displays and educational exhibits and chains such as Nordstrom and Dayton Hudson have tried them.
But for all of the entrepreneurs optimism it s still a tough sell to retailers.
Many would be buyers aren t sure what animated mannequins do or what purpose they serve.
One retailer who recently witnessed an android demonstration found the concept promising but "a little spooky.
Still android entrepreneurs take heart from the success of similar creations.
Theme parks for years have operated sophisticated permanently installed android displays costing hundreds of thousands or more to capture the imagination of children and other visitors.
Shopping malls for their part have long used simple mechanical Santa Clauses and miniature characters to greet and entertain customers at Christmastime.
What the new breed of android makers is trying to do is said Richard Gilbert general manager of Steren Robotics a San Diego firm that has made computerized mannequins.
The quality cost and capabilities of the middle market androids vary widely.
Gilbert s firm sells mannequins for retail displays priced at 3 100 that move their heads torsos and arms but offer no audio.
Like other manufacturers the firm also makes more expensive customized robots.
Newly formed Mannetron Productions of Glendale is marketing a more advanced off the shelf system for 26 000 whose basic components are a male mannequin a female mannequin and the personal computer that runs them.
Flip a switch and the Mannetron mannequins can shift their eyes and nod their heads.
Their lips move in sync with audio recordings that blare over a speaker.
On top of all that is a video option that allows the mannequins to turn toward a television screen and banter news anchorperson style with "correspondents.
a leading maker of animated characters for theme parks recently has focused more attention on robots for stores and malls.
Kelley the company s president said retailing robots account for a small but growing share perhaps 15 to 20 of the estimated 15 million to 20 million spent worldwide every year on displays featuring robot characters.
He believes that demand will be strongest for robots that entertain customers as retailers increasingly look for innovative ways to bring in business.
Among Sally s creations is a singing Maurice Chevalier robot made for a shopping center in northern England.
Other manufacturers are stressing the virtues of ordinary looking electronic dummies.
At trade shows they are less threatening than some real life salespeople said Dru Alan Jeanis a part owner of Mannetron Productions.
Visitors he said know that a mannequin In stores talking mannequins could recite descriptions of products and perhaps hand out free samples of grocery items.
It would enthusiasts say cut down on labor costs and attract more attention from customers at the same time.
said Sandy Gooch founder and marketing director for the Mrs.
For her part though Gooch said she isn t ready to put robots in her produce sections.
Instead Gooch s chain is considering buying a robotic mannequin for window displays to help create a special mood for its stores.
Industry executives concede that a number of technological social and economic factors limit how far retailing robots can go.
For starters don t expect to see an army of of mobile robots wandering around stores any time soon.
Robots that walk or more accurately roll are hard to power and control.
Worse yet they tend to frighten young children and pose legal liability issues.
Other advanced robot features such as refined arm movements are available but only at great cost.
said David Schweninger president of Sequoia Creative a maker of theme park attractions that sells android characters for up to 85 000.
Many industry officials believe that the cheaper androids retailers will use won t impress consumers who are accustomed to the quality of theme park robots.
Even among people who initially are intrigued by the retail robots the novelty could wear off quickly.
Among the skeptics about the prospects for computerized mannequins is Gerald J.
Greenwood executive director of the Western Assn.
POWERFUL TELESCOPE SOARS INTO SPACE ABOARD SHUTTLE.
The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe.
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles where its crew today will ever so carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope billed as the finest optical instrument ever created a 1.
5 billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.
Seven years behind schedule the telescope will be deployed by astronaut Steven Hawley an astronomer on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see.
conceded Edward Weiler program scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who was visibly shaken by the launch.
"Every astronomer " he said softly "should take today off.
" The launch marked the beginning of an era some say a revolution in the exploration of the universe.
"After 12 years " astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science Institute said with a sigh High above the haze of the Earth s atmosphere the Hubble is expected to produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on Earth today.
The telescope will not get down to serious science until it completes a seven month checkout and engineering period.
Then scientists will begin studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe.
After the deployment engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope.
Although scientific images that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not be released for several months there will be a few teasers early on.
In about seven days the Hubble should snap its first picture what astronomers call "first light" for the telescope but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much.
The image of a cluster of stars in the southern sky will be taken during the beginning of the focusing phase so it may not even be in focus.
said Caltech s James Westphal principal scientist for the telescope s wide field camera.
It will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from Earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity.
There will be other space telescopes in the years ahead but there will never be another moment quite like this.
Weiler said moments after Discovery lifted off on a sunny day pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future.
Sadly some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch.
They were here two weeks ago but when the launch was delayed because of a hydraulic problem they returned to their homes and many agencies had not budgeted for two trips to Cape Canaveral.
Weiler estimated that only about one third of the people who were here April 10 made it back for Tuesday s launch.
Among the missing were most of the families who had accompanied scientists in hopes of seeing this little bit of history.
There was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve failed to close automatically halting the countdown at 31 seconds before launch.
The valve was ordered by computer to correct its position and it did so clearing the way for the countdown to resume.
Shriver 45 sitting in the commander s seat the shuttle lifted off.
All five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights.
43 the pilot and mission specialists Bruce McCandless 52 and Kathryn D.
Sullivan and McCandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope.
The most anxious moments will come as Hawley gently lifts the 25 000 pound instrument out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay.
He will do that with the shuttle s robotic arm which he tested in the first hours of the flight.
The arm however tends to drift slightly so he will have his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload bay as he lifts it.
Engineers will not breathe freely until the telescope s two giant solar arrays are unfurled.
The solar arrays keep the telescope s high tech batteries charged and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged.
So Sullivan and McCandless will be ready to step outside and manually unfurl the solar arrays if necessary.
After the telescope is released and functioning on its own the Discovery will back off about 40 miles and shepherd the scope around Earth for two days.
If anything goes wrong during that period the shuttle can rendezvous with the telescope and McCandless and Sullivan can go out and work on the problem.

SOVIET SPACESHIP SLATED FOR REPAIR JOB IN ORBIT.
ASTRONAUTS AWAIT DELIVERY OF A LADDER TO FIX THE CRAFT DAMAGED DURING TAKEOFF.
The Soyuz spacecraft that took two Soviet cosmonauts to the space station Mir last February was damaged slightly during takeoff and is scheduled to be repaired before the cosmonauts can return to Earth U.
The experts stressed that the damage does not appear to threaten the cosmonauts or their mission.
Although American space officials have known about the damage to the Soyuz craft since February the knowledge did not become public until Soviet cosmonaut Alexander Serebrov visiting the United States revealed it in an interview with the trade journal Aviation Week and Space Technology.
The magazine s edition dated May 21 was published Friday.
According to the experts pieces of insulation on the outside of the Soyuz craft tore loose and are now blocking sensors that are used for aligning the craft for re entry.
But the craft has adequate backup sensors to perform the re entry according to James Oberg an American expert who has written a number of books about the Soviet space program.
But he added that the cosmonauts are preparing to make repairs before their scheduled Aug.
2 return to Earth as soon as a resupply vehicle takes them an extendable ladder that will allow them to reach the damaged area.
The insulation is used to keep the Soyuz from growing too cold when its power is turned down for long periods while it is docked to Mir.
astronaut John Fabian who was briefed in Washington by Serebrov the Soyuz is now much colder than normal and Soviet officials fear that the cold will cause water to condense in and damage the vehicle s electronic components.
Soviet ground controllers have ordered the two cosmonauts aboard Mir Anatoly Soloyev and Alexander Baladin to reposition the space station so that the Soyuz receives more sunlight in an effort to keep it warm.
The cosmonauts cannot simply climb into their spacesuits and fix the pieces of insulation batting Serebrov said because there are no handholds on the side of the Soyuz to which they can anchor themselves.
Handholds are placed over the surface of the space station but not on Soyuz because such protuberances on the craft s otherwise streamlined surface would overheat from the friction of the Earth s atmosphere and interfere with re entry.
Without such handholds Oberg said in a weightless environment.
The ladder is being sent to the cosmonauts in a regularly scheduled robotic resupply craft that is due to be launched at the beginning of June.
Holding onto the ladder the cosmonauts will be able either to reattach the loose ends of the fiber batting or simply to cut them free.
Surprisingly the cosmonauts are apparently not going to use their new jet backpacks successfully demonstrated in February for the repair.
The possibility that water could get into the Soyuz craft s electronics system is disturbing Oberg said.
he said telling why there is little threat to safety.
That program called Rescue Soyuz has a cadre of cosmonauts who could fly up to Mir pick up the two cosmonauts and return them safely to Earth he said.
Oberg said there is no indication that Soviet officials have taken steps to activate Rescue Soyuz.
Times staff writer Rudy Abramson in Washington contributed to this story.
WAXING ENTHUSIASTIC OVER TUSSAUD S ROCK N ROLL CIRCUS.
OPENED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO IN LONDON THE ROCK MUSEUM FEATURES ROBOTIC FIGURES OF ROCK STARS SCULPTED IN WAX.
A wax replica of Johnny Rotten is poised in a glass booth hands gripping the silver stem of a microphone its face twisted and contorted with a bit of spittle evident on the teeth.
"Look at Johnny Rotten " says a voice from overhead.
The unseen narrator reels off some facts about Rotten and his fellow Sex Pistols.
Nothing in the Rock Circus prepares visitors for the sting of learning that Rotten never liked them.
But at least that is the only painful moment during a tour of the combination wax museum robotics show Rock Hall of Fame.
That is unless you consider it painful to watch a Bob Dylan robot in Ray Bans strumming its way through Created by the Tussaud s Group the same company behind Mme.
Tussaud s Waxworks Rock Circus features dozens of sculpted rock stars.
Each figure is accompanied by a snatch of music and a dash of narrated comment.
On an upper floor of the exhibit is a staged "animatronic" show that offers a Disneyesque view of rock history.
Picture a Janis Joplin robot sitting on a park bench talking about the Summer of Love singing "Me and Bobby McGee" and introducing a David Bowie robot.
When credible musicians are displayed in such an overtly touristy way one expects the result to be disappointing.
Waxing nostalgic about rock n roll is one thing.
Turning rock n roll nostalgia into wax is something else.
Yet the Rock Circus generally manages to stay interesting if not compelling.
And although the commentary accompanying each display will not enlighten anyone with a basic knowledge of pop history it can be surprisingly acerbic for a tourist haunt.
Opened less than a year ago in the historic London Pavillion at Piccadilly Circus the 18 million rock n roll display is probably the most grandiose tourist attraction ever devoted exclusively to pop music.
It wasn t without careful research that The Tussaud s Group decided there was a market for wax figures of Jimi Hendrix Aretha Franklin and Robert Plant.
The company which also draws visitors to its castle and amusement park was looking for a new venture in the early 1980s.
says Martin King general manager of Rock Circus.
The company organized focus groups of Britons and foreigners Americans Scandinavians French Australians and Germans and tossed ideas at them.
The three main concepts Tussaud s was considering were an historical exhibit about London the lives of the contemporary rich and famous and something they called "The Pop Experience.
" What the Tussaud s researchers discovered was unequivocal says King.
The company is renowned for its wax figures so the machinery already was in place to create a gallery of stationary rockers.
But creating the "audio animatronic" figures the rock robots was daunting.
Deciding which stars should be represented in the Rock Circus was left to King Tussaud s executive Ian Hanson and rock writer Paul Gambaccini.
Americans may be baffled by the inclusion of Lonnie Donegan the 50s British skiffle star who hit briefly in the United States with "Rock Island Line" and And many people will be surprised to find there is not even a wax figure let alone a robot of Jim Morrison.
So far the gamble to invest heavily in a rock n roll attraction appears to be paying off.
King estimates that up to 750 000 rock fans will see the exhibit this year a reasonably good showing by local standards.
By comparison Madame Tussaud s the most popular tourist attraction in Great Britain draws 2.
The Rock Circus has no trouble attracting attention to itself.
figures of Jimi Hendrix Buddy Holly and Elton John stand outside on the balcony facing Piccadilly Circus looking down on the pedestrians like royalty.
Inside visitors are first sent over to have their picture taken with a sculpted David Bowie.
"There s no obligation" to buy the photograph later an employee repeats for each new arrival.
Everyone gets a headset which is keyed by electronic doodads overhead to provide the appropriate narration and music for each exhibit.
In the main room a rotating circular stage shows a very 70s Elton John performing "Bennie and the Jets " Little Richard singing "Tutti Frutti" and Stevie Wonder with All of a sudden boom.
Elvis Presly pops up from the center and sings "Glory Hallelujah.
" Many of the stars immortalized in wax posed for the Tussaud sculptors and donated personal items to make their display more realistic.
Tussaud s sculptor Stuart Williamson was one of the artists involved in capturing Eric Clapton.
The guitarist came to the Tussaud studio several times to pose with his guitar.
At one point he played an old blues number for the artists.
The sculptor went to Los Angeles to do Little Richard and to Frankfurt to get Sting who was on tour.
Johnny Rotten came into the Tussaud s studio several times and allowed the artists to make a cast of his rotten teeth.
After a tour through the wax figures visitors are sent to the grand finale the robot show.
The performance begins and ends with the theme from with Beatles replicas standing onstage looking like they were peeled from that album s cover.
In between Beatle numbers a Madonna robot sings "Like a Virgin " Bruce Springsteen does "Born in the U.
" and Bob Dylan plays The performance begs a question.
The show ends and the Rock Circus visitors are sent into a gift shop where they find pictures of themselves with David Bowie.
ANDROS 5A THE BOMB SQUAD ROBOT SHOWS WHAT HE S MADE OF.
Squat and deceptively awkward looking the Andros 5A a state of the art robot rode into Camarillo on Monday to show county law enforcement authorities what it can do.
In a demonstration before members of the Ventura County Sheriff s Department bomb squad the three foot tall remote controlled robot lurched through a range of exercises at the sheriff s shooting range at the Camarillo Airport.
The Andros is the first such robot to be demonstrated in Ventura County where sheriff s officials hope to purchase the model or one similar to it.
Bomb squads in Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego already have bomb handling robots authorities said.
In those areas the robots have proved invaluable in handling suspicious looking devices and have become standard safety equipment for bomb squads.
Sheriff s officials said a robot could be put to good use in Ventura County where the bomb squad has responded to more than 40 calls this year.
In the past three months two pipe bombs exploded in Thousand Oaks.
One which did 2 500 damage to a car in May apparently was planted by teen agers authorities said.
The other left in front of a Domino s Pizza Restaurant shattered a glass door and window.
Last week the bomb squad was called to pick up a device believed to be a pipe bomb on Hemlock Street in Ventura.
Although the Ventura device turned out to be a hoax the immediate area was evacuated.
Convery said he donned a 60 pound 10 000 bomb suit Convery said.
A robot equipped with an X ray device could have detected that the bomb was fake he said.
The Andros was merely stopping over in Ventura County on its way to the Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department where it is scheduled for delivery today.
Deputy Pat Hunter a Los Angeles sheriff s spokesman said the Andros will be used to replace another robot "that died on us" of mechanical failure.
In its Ventura performance the Andros was put through its paces in a graveled clearing by Shawn Farrow marketing manager for Remotec Inc.
Sitting behind a remote control panel containing a video monitor with a robot s eye view Farrow maneuvered the machine s extension arm to pick up first a briefcase and then a two foot long metal pipe the size of an average pipe bomb.
Displaying a delicacy that belied its 600 pound frame the robot attached to a 324 foot long cable trundled up a ramp and deposited the pipe in a huge drum with explosive resistant frame.
The Andros is capable of climbing most staircases can lift up to 100 pounds and is waterproof.
The versatile robot model has been used by law enforcement agencies in other states in hostage and terrorist situations Farrow said.
Earlier this year in Kentucky another Andros dubbed "Andy" by law enforcement officials in that state proved its mettle when a gun wielding youth took his entire school class hostage Farrow said.
The robot was used to transport box lunches to hungry hostages and so unnerved the youth that he addressed it as if it were human Farrow said.
An Andros in New York was shot at although the gunman missed.
The Andros basic price tag of about 66 000 can climb to 80 000 or more for a fully loaded model with such accessories as an X ray unit a Geiger counter and various kinds of hand like devices for picking up bombs and packages.
Purchasing the robot would be cost effective considering that the county recently increased the amount paid to the survivors of bomb squad members killed on duty from 50 000 to 100 000 Convery said.
But Ventura County may still be as much as a year away from getting a robot.
Vince France head of the Sheriff s Department s special services division said it is unlikely that the county could buy a robot before next fiscal year.
Besides sheriff s officials are still evaluating both the Andros and several other models and will choose one of the robots to recommend to the county for purchase France said.
So far the Andros is "heads above" some of its competition France said.
At the sharp end of a supply chain Dave Madden explains how United Stationers has turned the distribution of its goods into a fine art.
Distribution is one of the duller business ghettos dusty warehouses broken pallets and diesel oil.
As Fiat shows off its robot controlled inventory stacks in glossy advertisements and IBM switches off the lights in its automated warehouse in Greenock it is clear that this Cinderella operation has a new set of high tech glad rags.
Britain s high street retailer Marks and Spencer has long appreciated that sophisticated distribution processes are an important part of supply chain management.
They influence customer loyalty product differentiation and profit margins.
The company with the best distribution systems and service level will win all the marbles.
One consequence of this shift is the emergence of a new type of wholesale service company where distribution is just as important as the product that is shipped.
The answer in the US at least is value added distribution.
United Stationers the country s biggest office products distributor can sell and ship a single pencil or one box of paper clips and still make a profit.
The same is true on all 25 000 items in its catalogue from pens to filing cabinets.
Not surprisingly this demands an extensive physical operation.
United Stationers based near Chicago sells products from around 400 manufacturers to some 10 000 retailers across the US via 14 regional distribution centres.
This physical network is entirely dependent on a complex computing and telecommunications infrastructure.
Amdahl 5995 and IBM 3090 mainframes supported by robotic storage devices from Storage Technology as well as telephone and satellite communications networks.
United s customers obtain information on the company s inventory via a computer network which connects their machines to United s system of 1 400 PCs.
This automates the ordering process and allows clients to see whether United has a particular product in stock.
Our customers enter upwards of 70 per cent of our orders for us says Patrick Murray IT vice president.
We do it in batch mode we do it online however a customer requires it.
Ultimately Murray expects United s terminals to be on the desks of his customers customers too and he intends to apply the same technology to links with his own suppliers.
Ordering is only part of the value added process.
The sooner the retailer knows that United has shipped goods the sooner he can bill his customer and collect his money says Murray.
Similarly United uses the system to get the latest manufacturers pricing information to these retailers so that they can manage their prices too.
Giving retailers such access to and control over the ordering and inventory process and the imperative to turn orders around in hours has had serious implications for United s warehousing operation.
Rather they are put in the next available bin as dictated by United s disparate product range.
boxes of pencils and desks do not take up the same shaped space.
The warehouse map is computer controlled and the system tracks every individual batch of items.
Surprisingly this random binning is not completely arbitrary.
The system is able to analyse the inventory and track hot products high moving items and guide them to where they are most accessible.
When a piece of inventory is manually put into store staff use radio frequency data entry terminals complete with bar coded reading guns to update the control system directly on line.
The logical extension of all this says Murray is to use similar tools and the same bar code in the transportation and delivery process so that a driver can verify that the right carton has been dropped at the right door and give proof of delivery.
United hopes to introduce such an innovation this year.
The same integrated technology feeds United s sales and marketing effort.
Its primary marketing tool is a catalogue of products and United publishes and distributes some 4m copies a year.
But because the catalogue becomes out of date almost immediately after it is issued (with products being added or dropped) Murray has to provide regular updates.
He is hoping in the near future however to produce an electronic catalogue with colour pictures dimension data and moving price information.
At the hub of United s operation is a central IT development and operations staff.
Typically this is pared to the bone 40 people to manage data and voice communications systems operations and a help desk (there is no computer expertise in the regional centres).
In addition Murray has 100 staff in applications development and product introduction.
The effect of this technological commitment is two fold Murray says.
First United has grown significantly it is now a Dollars 1bn company and one of just four national office products distributors in the US.
Second its technology culture has enabled United to set pioneering service levels.
About 80 per cent of what we sell is not in the same packaging that it came to us in.
We don t sell a whole carton of paper we ll sell one ream.
Now the service we provide for our reseller says you go out to each of your customers and you take the orders the way they want them.
You send the orders to us and we ll package them in such a way that they can be delivered directly to the end user and you don t have to add labour.
When we put the label on the box the label says it came from you not from us.
The most profitable dealer is the guy who never sees the merchandise absolutely never sees it at all.
Because United delivers anywhere in the US by the following day and guarantees to be in stock on all of its inventory that has become the service norm.
Similarly United cannot afford to let up on its technical innovation.
Murray claims that the company currently has a lead of six to 12 months but the competition is pretty good at copying so we better have the next thing coming up to keep the gap open.
To get the order we ve got to be the easiest company to do business with he says.
Search for new applications Robotics still on the fringe of the industrial sector.
FOR all the hype over the past 20 years about how robots would transform manufacturing industry they still remain on the fringes of the industrial scene with the notable exception of manufacturing in Japan.
According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe the world industrial robot population stood at 388 000 units at the end of 1989 of which 220 000 were in Japan 56 000 in western Europe 37 000 in the US and very roughly 75 000 elsewhere.
In the past there has been considerable hostility from trade unions to their introduction and managements have taken a lot of convincing about the cost benefits.
Dr Kevin Clarke manager of manufacturing engineering at PA Consulting Group says that in many instances robots have not delivered the cost effectiveness they have promised.
Robot manufacturers he says have not developed their products technologically as fast as they might have.
There s very little innovation because the market isn t there he says.
However the evidence of the past two years suggests that things may be changing.
Those 388 000 units represented an increase of 20 per cent from the end of 1988 and in 1990 US based robotics companies won record new orders of Dollars 517.
The robotics industry was in deep gloom during 1986 and 1987 and especially in the US where it had become far too dependent on the motor industry which took about 40 to 50 per cent of sales.
Mr Donald Vincent executive vice president of the US Robotic Industries Association recalls that when the automotive industry quit buying in 1986 and 1987 it sent robotics into a deep spin.
First it encouraged a much needed concentration among robot producers.
In the middle of the 1980s there were some 300 according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).
Now it says there are probably fewer than 100 true producers led by ABB Robotics part of the Swiss Swedish Asea Brown Boveri GMF Robotics a joint venture between Fanuc of Japan and General Motors of the US and Yaskawa of Japan.
Secondly the downturn prompted an urgent search for new applications for robots away from the motor industry and its inherent cyclicality.
Dr Clarke singles out clean room applications for robots in health care and precision engineering while Mr Vincent is hopeful of new applications in the food industry materials handling and packaging.
The wellspring for this diversification into new markets which has already begun is computer power.
In mechanical terms robots are relatively simple beasts and robotic technology has always been based on the use of computers to overcome mechanical limitations.
Mr Kenneth Waldron a robotics expert at Ohio State University says the major theme which will direct commercial applications of new research in robotics will be that of taking advantage of the huge increases in computing power which have become available as a result of the development of advanced microprocessors.
Mr Waldron notes that most current industrial robot systems offer only incremental improvements over what was possible with the first generation of microcomputer controllers.
Current research is looking at areas such as greater use of sensing of the robot s environment and internal state more sophisticated control techniques offering greater speed and accuracy robotic mobility and improved control of the interface between the robot and the workpiece.
Given these trends there has inevitably been considerable interest in industrial vision systems for robots which could radically change many applications particularly in assembly where robots have so far failed to make their mark.
Previous forecasts for the population of vision equipped robots have not been realised but it is reasonable to predict as the IFR has that the continuous reduction in prices of computers and sensors and their greater speed and reliability will gradually remove the technological and economic barriers.
Many of the business trends in robotics over the past few years are illustrated by developments at ABB Robotics which claims to be the world s biggest supplier a title which the Japanese manufacturers might dispute.
ABB s purchase last year of Cincinnati Milacron s robotics business was an important step in the consolidation of the industry around leading European and Japanese suppliers.
Mr Stelio Demark head of ABB Robotics says the Cincinnati business brought with it a tremendous US customer base and undoubted expertise in spot welding robotics.
The nature of ABB s customer base has also been changing and over the past five years it has reduced its dependence on the automotive industry from 70 75 per cent of sales to 50 per cent.
ABB is attracting new business from small and medium sized companies which had previously not bought robots.
We may be supplying ones and twos but it s growing very quickly says Mr Demark.
New markets include glass making different kinds of process applications and palletising.
This effort is backed up by spending on research and development 10 per cent of revenues that is almost on a par with that of the pharmaceutical industry.
Meanwhile the falling cost of electronics is allowing ABB to build more capability and flexibility into its robots.
ABB s latest product the IRB 6000 was officially launched last month with claims of much greater flexibility and capability than rival products.
Because of these developments Mr Demark is optimistic about future growth prospects for ABB and the industry.
In a report about to be published by Frost Sullivan the international market research publishers total world robot sales are forecast to rise from Dollars 2.
The relatively small size of the industry at the end of the 1980s is a reflection of many of the factors mentioned above.
F S sees the Japanese market s share of world robot sales falling from 65 per cent last year to 45 per cent in 1996 while Europe s share will rise from 15 to 20 per cent the US will mark time at about 6 per cent and the rest of the world will jump from 14 per cent to just under 30 per cent.
The biggest growth area is Asia which is good news for the Japanese producers but Europe says Mr Demark is also very interesting and the company s home base.
F S sees the European market rising from Dollars 330m in 1990 to Dollars 687m in 1996 with Germany leading the way.
Looking specifically at the European market F S comments that the supplier capable of marketing a complete package including sensors user friendly software and simple training and installation will achieve the best sales penetration.
ABB is probably justified in claiming that it offers more service and support to European buyers than the more product based approach of the Japanese but Dr Clarke wonders whether this will still be true in two years time.
On the other hand Europe he says is probably not one of the Japanese producers priorities given the better growth prospects in the Asia Pacific region.
As for the balance of power in the industry both ABB and the Japanese are growing stronger the big producers are getting bigger and the smaller robotics companies particularly in the US and UK are concentrating on niches and ancillary services.
If the big producers can keep up with development in computing the 1990s could well bring the rewards that proved so elusive for much fo the 1980s.
Fuzzy logic and robots spell technological advantage Japan modifying production philosophies as emphasis shifts back to the human workforce.
a couple years ago a Japanese manufacturer replaced some factory line workers with automation machinery then set up full sized cardboard human dummies to keep the remaining workers from getting lonely.
The completely workerless factory is a decade away but there are a few showcase examples including Fanuc the machine tool manufacturer s factory near Mount Fuji where robots make robots.
But until no human factories are realised on a broad scale factory automation system makers will focus their research on bridging the awkward interaction between humans and the ever increasing number of machines working by their side.
In past years manufacturers put the emphasis on installing labour saving machines to raise production.
They focused on maximising the use of people money time and materials and humans had to find a way to fit in with the complex machinery beginning to surround them.
Until now humans have had to adapt to use machines so the man machine interface was not well matched says Mr Hiroshi Matsuyama a manager at Omron the programmable controller maker in Tokyo.
The centre of production has shifted to human workers and computers should be matched with humans he says.
That means designing new software that allows production machinery to be more easily used and changed quickly for different jobs.
For example welding or insertion and using artificial intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic to help robots and computers make better decisions such as finding an operational failure through inferences as humans do.
The escalating skilled labour shortage brought about by a declining birth rate and a more affluent and highly educated society makes robots an important component of factory automation a do or die decision for some companies.
Strong competition in industries such as shipping has resulted in waves of investment in labour saving technology such as steel and aluminium cutting tools processing machines and welding robots.
8 per cent a year until 1993 then it is likely to fall off by half to 0.
4 per cent until 2000 according to Japanese government statistics.
During that time Japan expects to keep about a 4 per cent annual economic growth rate.
To achieve this it is necessary to introduce automation technology says Mr Kanji Yonemoto vice chairman of the Japan Industrial Robot Association (Jira) in Tokyo.
An even more remarkable shift in Japan s economy is the switch from a manufacturing to a service economy.
5m fewer blue collar workers in manufacturing by 2000 than in 1989 when there was a shortage of 715 800 people.
Today s young people are a different breed of worker from those who laboured long hours for little pay to build Japan s industrial miracle.
kiken (dangerous) kitanai (dirty) and kitsui (hard).
Older men were very patient and had the Bushido (warrior) morale but it is hard to find these people today says Mr Matsuyama.
Omron which produces programmable controllers and other electronics products sees the improvements that can be made in factory automation as almost limitless and including diagnosing system failures and other management tasks.
The improvements span a broad factory automation market valued at almost Y2 000bn and covering every aspect of making a product from design through production and inspection.
The important components of automating a factory are numerical controllers the largest chunk of the market as well as computer aided design and manufacturing software and equipment industrial robots programmable controllers automated warehouses computers and automatic guided vehicles that transport products throughout a plant site.
Japan leads the world in both producing and using these production components.
It has replaced Germany as the biggest exporter of machine tools an important indicator of industrial development and economic power.
Japan has an estimated 23 per cent of the world market compared to the 16 per cent held by Germany.
Five Japanese companies are making machine tools in Europe.
Mazak Yamazaki for example has a Dollars 50m factory in Worcester in the UK which produces some 100 computer controlled machines a month according to industry estimates.
Japan s worldwide share of the fast growing robot market is even more impressive.
5 per cent of the robot installations worldwide with western Europe having 14.
Japan s main advantages are that workers in automotive electronics and other factories are accustomed to and readily accept automation technology product demand is still strong in the home market and Japanese manufacturers make most of the machines they use for automation so there is little competition from imports.
The electronics industry is the biggest user of automation technology.
At its Ome design and manufacturing works west of Tokyo Toshiba uses its own laptop computers for design development and assembly of new Toshiba laptops.
The laptops are used to compute how easily a new computer model can be assembled by a line of 12 workers who can slap together one notebook size Dynabook computer in a few minutes.
That s important because the company is making about 1m laptops a year at Ome and the life span of each new product is getting increasingly shorter amid hot competition.
Often it s the case with some products that the effective life span is already over by the time it goes to the market place says Mr Masao Suga who heads the personal computer research and development department at Ome.
However the shortening product life spans which run from six months for a Japanese word processor to about three years for laptops made it increasingly difficult for Toshiba to continue using robots.
Toshiba replicates about 70 per cent of design work from current models in new ones.
While it took Toshiba three years to develop the T3100 and J3100 laptops from scratch it took only nine months to design the smaller size Dynabook.
Though its factory is about 70 80 per cent automated visitors to the company often comment about the number of people still present on the manufacturing lines but Mr Suga says that with the fast paced product life cycles humans are needed.
They can t catch up with new technology so humans are acting as universal super robots he adds.
Fuzzy logic may help close the gap.
Mr Yonemoto of Jira says fuzzy logic software that can help make a decision from unclear information will help increase the versatility of robots in the future by affording better control of their movements.
Omron a leader in using fuzzy technology has developed a test robot that can grasp soft or fragile items such as tofu (bean curd).
In a New Year s address to employees Mr Yoshio Tateisi company president identified fuzzy logic as an important research area for the 1990s.
By 1994 more than 20 per cent of Omron s product line will include some type of fuzzy logic.
According to Mr Matsuyama fuzzy logic has many benefits.
As part of a computer integrated manufacturing (Cim) system it can be used in production and in managing the company.
Another merit of fuzzy technology is to replace a person where computers are hard to use for example controlling a nuclear power generation plant s circulation control system to clean water and to make decisions.
Perhaps the Chernobyl or Mihama plant accidents could have been avoided with these systems he says.
Fuzzy logic along with more flexible robots and other components spell another technological advantage for Japan in the future.
being able to change small scale production quickly so that multiple products can be produced on the same factory line in one day.
Mr Matsuyama predicts Japanese manufacturers will become very good at this small scale production which is a difficult technology demanding ultimate flexibility.
Computerisation would be all the more necessary in production in the sense that market information should be more effectively connected with the production process or with the factory itself.
But large scale flexible production without man will take 8 10 years says Matsushita Electric in Osaka.
The company believes fuzzy logic along with neurocomputing technology which more closely mimics the human brain will be the main technologies once they are refined.
Two hundred tons of steel come to a precise halt a hoist is lowered the spreader locks on to a 40 foot container and winches it more than 100 feet into the air.
At first sight there is nothing particularly unusual about the towering cranes going about their business at the Pounds 140m Thamesport deep water container terminal on the Isle of Grain the first purpose built container port in Britain.
But these are robot cranes and they are being controlled and monitored not by a chunky mainframe but by a desktop PC sitting several hundred yards away in the port s office block.
What is more the computer knows the position of every container in the seven quarter mile long 110 foot high stacks.
It uses magnetic swipe cards and radio modems to direct a truck driver to the right position to collect or to deliver a load.
Thamesport which began operations in May 1990 and will have a capacity of 400 000 con tainers when the last of its three development phases is completed is probably the world s most automated port.
Three years ago when Thamesport was still in the planning stages Keith Archer Thamesport s business systems manager was charged with developing an automated container port system which would provide a quick and efficient service with the minimum manning levels and cost.
And unlike conventional ports it would permit the servicing of ships and haulage independently.
Initially he looked for a packaged software system to control the port s complex administration communications and cargo handling needs.
He settled on a customised solution based on the Global 3000 Development Suite from TIS Software a subsidiary of the Misys computer services group.
Working with Farnborough based software house Advanced PC Products Archer designed the main elements involved in the automation of the port the back office administration system and port control system.
One of the most innovative features of the Thamesport s system is the control of remote peripherals.
Using customised communications software radio modems and swipe cards the system supervises the movement of all machinery within the port including the five monster ship to shore robot cranes and the 14 gantry cranes which unload the containers from the ships and then organise them into the storage stacks before loading them on to trucks.
At the moment the cranes are still manned but are expected to go fully automatic shortly.
Truck drivers entering the port to load or unload cargo are guided and monitored remotely by the system.
System peripherals verify customs clearance photograph the container direct the lorry to the appropriate gantry slot and print an itinerary of the driver s stay at the port.
On average 350 trucks enter the port each day and 85 per cent of them are inside the Thamesport gates for less than two hours.
Electronic data interchange fax and telex message functions connect Thamesport with data processing systems at its customers HM Customs and Excise government departments overseas ports banks and insurers.
Despite the complexity of the port s operations Archer was able to get the system up and running within 15 months and incorporate additional hardware as the port s facilities have expanded.
The core hardware cost Pounds 200 000 and Archer says the port could be run on three PCs one for accounting and office systems one for control and one as a back up.
Computers go it alone Why corporate IT departments no longer need the human touch.
That s the kind of task that operators of corporate computers face every day.
Computer generated messages from all over a company s network arrive at IT centres as fast as those postcards.
The operators surrounded by banks of monitors do their best to sort out the messages and keep the system running.
But humans cannot react as fast as computers and whenever they intervene it slows things down.
Only in the late 1980s with the advent of software designed to automate some of the operators tasks did solutions start to arrive.
Robots are now available for loading and unloading memory tapes and schedulers for pre arranging the flow of work through a computer over a period of time.
Other automation products will recover failed applications or start or close the whole system in a safe and systematic way at the press of a button.
Software can also attack the gush of messages cutting out the junk mail and sending back standard replies.
After most messages have been filtered out the remaining ones can be displayed on a single screen as a colour coded chart for example.
One glance can quickly show how the whole system is performing.
Another way of cutting down the messages would be to stop writing software that generates so many.
Every year hardware gets faster and faster and more and more messages are spewed out by software packages that were designed for a slower environment maybe 20 years ago.
Operators have generally welcomed automation rather than seeing it as a threat.
Software is taking over the grunt work says George Kurtz an automation expert with Computer Associates the US systems house.
Computer operators are freed to become computer analysts a more creative occupation with big benefits for the employer.
By the turn of the century I expect them to be called network engineers.
Despite its advantages automated operations has been slow to take off.
The technology centred on IBM mainframes is five years old says Suzanne Nicastro director of strategic planning with Legent a US automation supplier.
Some jumped right on but others were scared off because it appeared untested or they thought it could lead to them losing their jobs.
Two years ago though it was shooting up like crazy because there were more visible success stories to point to.
People have got distracted and they re trying to make things work that they ve already invested in says Nicastro.
But the automation market is only 25 per cent penetrated so there s still a lot of potential there.
The threat to jobs is not as great as one might expect.
US computer centres are growing at an average of 25 per cent a year in terms of computer power and workload says Nicastro.
Automated operations allows them to grow at this rate without increasing staff she claims.
When automation products first arrived it seemed that completely unattended or lights out computer centres would be the ultimate goal.
There would be no human operators just a babysitter or security guard.
Nowadays few companies entertain ambitions of this kind.
A more common aim is to run a computer centre remotely from a PC at home perhaps or from another building if the computer centre is on a split site.
This latter idea offers big savings for a company faced with integrating two computer sites after a merger or acquisition.
But the physical location of the nearest human expert is still of concern to many.
The idea of leaving a corporate nerve centre totally unattended sends chills up and down my spine says Kurtz.
The last data centre I managed would have sustained serious damage if personnel had not been on site.
Automated operations have a more wide ranging significance he argues.
It forces a company to sit down and rethink the way it does everything.
If you want to automate the management of a company then automated operations is nothing more than the foundation on which to build.
Current products automate several different operational tasks on mainly IBM machines.
But the future is about systems that work across a wide range of hardware and integrate the different automation products so that they feed each other.
Computer Associates claims to be the only company offering such a system today.
Its products are designed for the company s open architecture called CA90s which embraces any kind of hardware.
Companies can t afford to build interfaces to different platforms says Kurtz.
The only way you can solve the complexity is with an integrated system.
Such integration promises to unlock the full benefits of automation as it moves up to the higher levels of a company.
Eventually it will be like flying an aeroplane says Kurtz.
A jet engine has maybe 30 000 components and the pilot sits in the middle and controls it with a couple of levers.
SHELL UK OIL wants its staff to have direct control of the computers they use.
It is installing a voice activated system for users who are spread across many different sites in the UK.
Staff will phone the computer centre in Manchester and be guided through a digitised meny to trigger the computer programs they want.
They will be able to request recorded information cancel an application when it goes wrong or speak to a human being for example.
This is part of the company s move into automated operations.
An automation product called OPS MVS from Goal Systems of the US is the hub of a strategy that will move most operators away from Shell s central control room.
Nowadays operators are not necessary for things like lifts cashpoint machines or phone calls all of these gave users direct control of their environment.
There s no reason why the same ideas are not applicable to us says Ian Lowe automation project leader.
All electronic messages coming into Shell s computer from various parts of the network will be handled automatically.
These will be filtered out and relayed via BT to experts who could be based anywhere.
We re removing the trivia from the operators job and giving them an opportunity to get involved in more rewarding activities says Lowe.
BOB JONES is one of his computer s best friends.
Jones is technical services manager at Physicians Mutual an insurance company in Omaha Nebraska.
The company was one of the first in the US to use automated operations software and last year took a further step by introducing two new products developed by the US automation supplier Candle Corporation.
One of these AF Performer monitors and tunes the computers automatically.
When it was installed it uncovered technical problems and inefficiences that no one had noticed before.
The other product AF Remote allows the computer to phone someone for help it it gets into trouble.
Together the products allow the computer to work unattended.
This has allowed Physicians Mutual to end weekend shifts for computer operators and save more than Dollars 8 000 (Pounds 4 500) a year.
If AF Performer faces a problem it attempts to correct it first but if it can t it calls out through AF Remote to an operator with a PC explains Jones.
AF Performer hs already saved four stoppages which would have knocked out 600 terminals and cost the company several thousand dollars.
We ve redirected them from being a slave to the machine to making the machine a slave to them says Jones.
Making tracks Andrew Baxter explains how ancient and modern techniques are used in the construction of tanks.
In the past few weeks workers at the Vickers Defence Systems tank factory at Newcastle upon Tyne have had to walk round a large hole that has opened up in the middle of the shopfloor.
The hole might suggest that Vickers has started test firing its tank guns indoors but there is a more innocent explanation.
It is to provide foundations for a new Pounds 500 000 computer controlled machining centre being supplied by Halifax based Butler Newall.
The machine will replace three 30 year old Giddings Lewis horizontal boring machines and will do all their machining work on the tank hulls in one setting.
For Bill McGawley divisional operations director the new machine is an investment in new technology that is worth making because of the time saved and the contribution to increased competitiveness.
A walk through the 543m long plant armoured plate in at one end completed tank out from the other end is a history lesson in the machine tool industry.
Names long gone such as Kendall Gent of the UK rub shoulders with the Mori Seikis of the modern era.
In between are venerable machines that have been given a new lease of life.
Vickers spent Pounds 90 000 last year restoring a 600 ton press made in Birmingham in 1936 and used for straightening thick plate after welding.
McGawley is keen to dispel the impression that the British Army s 140 new Challenger tanks to be built at Newcastle and its sister plant in Leeds will be the products of old fashioned manufacturing technology.
But the mixture of old and new is deliberate and intended to answer the challenge of manufacturing tanks competitively and profitably in the modern era.
Vickers is the only company in the world to have been continuously producing tanks since they were introduced in 1916 and wants to remain so.
The critical manufacturing issue for a low volume product in a market where margins have fallen and competition is now more open and international is reducing break even to a minimum.
Expenditure on new machine tools is an important part of the equation.
Buying elegant machinery that shaves a few seconds or minutes off machining times may make sense for a high volume manufacturer says McGawley as the cost of the machine can be spread over thousands of products.
In tank production with many large pieces requiring long set up times for machining a few minutes saved while the metal is cut may not be that critical.
And highly specialised machinery could reduce flexibility when the production line switches to a new model.
This approach to manufacturing lies behind the transformation in Vickers tank production business over the past decade.
Ancient sprawling manufacturing plants with long chains of command and five different levels of dining room have been swept away first at Newcastle in 1983 and then in Leeds three years later.
The company now has two identical plants each of which can produce a complete tank allowing for the fact that 60 per cent of each tank s content is sourced externally.
The strategy masterminded by Gerry Boxall Vickers Defence Systems chairman and chief executive flies in the face of modern manufacturing convention which calls for the elimination of duplication and concentration of different stages of manufacturing in separate plants.
But Vickers does not want to go down this route says McGawley.
Strategically it would make the company vulnerable to the consequences of upsizing and downsizing of order flows and competition between the two plants can be constructive and beneficial if properly controlled.
The result of the upheavals at the company and its innovative approach to manufacturing technology is that each factory can break even on two to three tanks a month yet can expand to ten a month simply by adding shifts.
The wisdom of McGawley s approach to manufacturing options is illustrated by some of its recent experiences with new equipment.
On the one hand it has had no trouble assimilating some of the new techniques in manufacturing developed for high volume production such as car manufacturing.
It has bought CNC lathes and a CAD system virtually off the shelf.
But a recent episode with robotics was another story.
With financial backing from the UK government McGawley bought a robot to weld turrets which Vickers makes for armoured fighting vehicles.
The robot had no trouble welding armoured plate despite certain metallurgical challenges in half the time that a human welder would require.
The problem was integrating the robot and its software to ensure that the welding torch moved to the right place.
Along with difficulties setting up large castings for the robot to work on this made it difficult to achieve the repeatability which is normally one of the main benefits of robotics.
Three years after purchasing the robot and after spending about Pounds 1m McGawley says it is now performing well and he looks forward to extending the use of robots.
But manual craft skills will still be required for welding in difficult positions and as with other parts of the manufacturing process old and new will complement each other.
Much of the Pounds 1m investment in manufacturing equipment at Newcastle over the past year is linked to preparation for fulfilling the Pounds 500m Challenger 2 order.
Building tanks is a lengthy affair but the philosophy at Vickers which has brought design and manufacturing teams closer together physically and metaphorically has had a profound impact on product development times.
The first CRARVV (Challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle) rolled off the production line in autumn 1990 five years after Vickers began concept work and went straight to the Gulf.
Formerly says McGawley the project would have taken eight to nine years.
Management schools would no doubt applaud Vickers new co ordinated approach to tank manufacture as a classic example of the teamwork element in simultaneous or concurrent engineering.
McGawley will have none of that preferring instead to call it sheer bloody common sense.
My wife in the kitchen doesn t have the kettle on one table the tea on another and the sugar in a different room.
Androids on the march After years on the breadline modern robots are finding gainful employment in Europe.
In the US fashion industry they call it localised abrasion the pre worn look for denim jeans produced by applying potassium permanganate solution to the knee thigh and seat areas.
The faded effect has traditionally been achieved through manual spraying but consistency and quality control have been hard to achieve.
Now GMFanuc Robotics has perfected a robotic solution that is three times faster than manual spraying can reproduce a spray pattern to an accuracy of 0.
03 inch and can be programmed easily to handle a wide range of garments.
The system is a relatively simple example of recent trends in the industrial robotics industry which is trying to reduce its dependence on comparatively mature automotive markets and find new applications elsewhere.
It is a trend that is particularly important for robot suppliers in the European market where the overall penetration of robots into industry is much lower than in Japan and where a potentially huge market for non automotive applications remains untapped.
According to Massimo Mattucci vice president for engineering and marketing at Comau of Italy around 50 per cent of industrial robots installed in Europe are in use in the automotive industry and 20 per cent in electronics the reverse of the situation in Japan.
The automotive industry has more or less understood the potential of robots says Stelio Demark head of ABB Robotics Europe s largest producer although he stresses along with other robot industry executives the potential of robots in the paint spraying and final assembly area of European vehicle manufacturing.
The inherent flexibility of modern robots and the advances made in control systems and mechanics that have increased their speed and reliability ought to increase their suitability for small batch manufacturing in Europe where model changes are frequent.
Demark sees new opportunities for robots emerging in the European food packaging pharmaceutical and white goods industries.
But the pace at which European industry accepts robots will depend partly on suppliers ability to counter the mistrust caused by the hype of the 1970s and early 1980s when the robot industry appeared to be carried away by euphoria over business prospects.
In Japan one of the driving forces behind the growth in the industrial robot population to 274 210 in 1990 nearly 10 times the population in the former West Germany has been labour shortages.
Everything has to come back to economic considerations says Axel Gerhardt an executive board member of IWKA the holding company for Kuka Germany s largest robot supplier.
In Japan the question is often whether to produce with a robot or not to produce there at all.
Mistakes have also been made in the installation of robots for which the suppliers and customers have to share the blame.
People have tended to put in a robot then have an operator standing by watching says Demark.
Increasingly robot suppliers are realising that if they are to make inroads into the small and medium sized businesses that still dominate European industry especially outside the automotive sector they have to understand better the customer s needs and worries.
You have to enter into an economic calculation with the customer and demonstrate the ability to find a solution says Mattucci.
That could mean being paid only for a feasibility study that comes down against the use of robots.
But in the long run this approach makes more sense for an industry that wants to broaden its customer base and maintain its reputation.
Comau which sells most of its robots as part of an integrated automation package is around 90 per cent dependent on the vehicle industry.
Mattucci wants to expand the remaining 10 per cent of the business to 30 per cent over the next five years by exploiting the group s strengths in robotics for body welding mechanical assembly and difficult handling operations.
The Italian company s most ambitious step away from the automotive sector is its involvement in the Columbus Automation and robotics Testbed (Cat) programme financed by the European Space Agency.
The ground testbed for the automation and robotics on board the projected Columbus Space Station will incorporate a new Comau robot using advanced materials such as aeronautical alloys and composites.
A more down to earth approach to broadening the customer base is in evidence at GMFanuc the US Japanese concern which is the world s second biggest supplier.
The jean spraying robot developed in the US and now available in the UK offers a high return on investment with a payback of less than a year says Mike Wilson the UK sales and marketing manager.
Robotics are also in their infancy in the European food industry partly because it has hitherto been difficult to turn a hose on to a robot to clean it without ruining its electrical circuits.
In January GMFanuc launched its Washdown robot to conform to the strict hygiene requirements of the food industry and withstand all the chemical substances likely to be used in washdown or wipedown procedures.
In the European electronics industry robots are more frequent but applications are still developing.
Data Packaging an Irish supplier of plastic moulded components for the computer industry recently installed an ABB Robotics painting cell to handle metallic paints used to provide an attractive finish and assist in electrical shielding on parts for the Apple Macintosh.
Metallic paints are hard to handle because they block supply lines if not kept flowing continuously.
The ABB system programs the robot to fire the spray gun if the system lays dormant for a given length of time.
Advances such as these are often based on techniques originally developed for the automotive industry which is not being neglected in suppliers haste to exploit other markets.
A number of fairly recent technologies have relevance to the use of robots in automotive and non automotive fields.
Laser welding says Wilson is attracting interest in a number of industries including aerospace because of its precision and speed.
Unlike conventional spot welding the robot does not have to reach both sides of the part to be welded.
Another emerging technology especially when combined with robotics is water jet cutting which is likely to become increasingly important for cutting plastics quickly and cleanly.
It is already being used in the automotive industry for cutting carpets door panels and instrument panels.
In both areas robot suppliers are forming partnerships with companies which have developed the technologies so that they can exploit the opportunities quicker.
Comau has a co operation agreement with Trumpf the German machine tool builder best known for its laser cutting machines while last year ABB Robotics formed a joint venture with Ingersoll Rand of the US to develop and market a robotised water jet cutting system in Europe.
The search for a broader European customer base coincides with a much more price conscious attitude over the past two to three years among customers due as much to general business conditions as to scepticism about the early claims made by robot suppliers.
Suppliers are rationalising their product ranges to give customers what they want and no more but using developments in control systems to increase the applications available from each model.
These conditions give advantages and disadvantages in more or less equal measure to European suppliers and Japanese US importers which control one third of the market.
Demark and Mattucci strongly believe that the European suppliers benefit from a approach based on solutions rather than products.
The Japanese do not have the solutions for European needs says Mattucci flatly.
This is a view strongly disputed by the Japanese producers but in a price sensitive market the the Japanese do have the advantage of size investment in control systems in particular can be spread over a bigger sales base.
Ultimately though all the robot suppliers could benefit if they can persuade more European companies of the benefits of robots.
And that is likely to be a gradual process where technology is only one factor in the equation.
WE GO where no one else dares boasts an engineer from the deep sea drilling team of Petrobras Brazil s state oil monopoly.
At 625 metres the company s Platform XIII in the Marlim oilfield off the coast of Rio de Janeiro is the world s deepest in production.
Petrobras s efforts were rewarded earlier this week with the Offshore Technology Conference Award for Distinguished Achievement the oil industry s most prestigious technology prize.
The company has been breaking records for deep sea oil production since 1986 when it put into commercial operation a well at a depth of 384m.
Having identified oil in deeper waters we realised we needed to develop the technologies to make this production viable says Roberto Jardim director of deep sea production at Petrobras.
Since then the company has been going deeper and deeper breaking depth records for installation of monobuoys manifolds and submerged pipelines.
In March of last year it broke through the 750m barrier at its Marlim field.
Previously 350m was considered the limit because it is the maximum depth at which divers can work.
Most platforms in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are at less than 200m.
Petrobras was forced to go deeper because Brazil s main oil reserves lie in water as deep as 3 000m.
Until the late 1970s the country was importing 80 per cent of its oil needs but the combination of two oil shocks sent the bill soaring.
In addition the debt crisis which cut off access to foreign capital made it imperative for Brazil to start exploiting its own reserves.
Unlike other companies which test new equipment exhaustively before use we like to develop our equipment on site even though this may mean interrupting production.
We can do this because we have the advantage of real fields to test in so we can move quickly to make the process economic says Jardim.
Mainly as a result of its deep sea successes Brazil now imports only 40 per cent of its 1.
The Campos Basin where Petrobras s wells are located accounts for more than 60 per cent of Brazil s oil production.
It has estimated reserves of 6bn barrels in a 100 000 sq km area ranging from the coast to a depth of 3 000m.
The secret of the company s success according to Petrobras technicians is the combination of a wet Christmas tree and a deep sea robot.
A wet Christmas tree is oil industry jargon for the pipe and valve mechanism placed on a wellhead to control flow before oil can be pumped out.
Conventional oilfields use steel lines or divers to guide the positioning.
But fields such as Marlim are too deep to use these methods at 720m where the first Marlim well was completed the pressure is 14 times that of the earth s atmosphere.
The Petrobras breakthrough was achieved by using a satellite signal to direct the tree into its place on the wellhead guided by the giant eye (in the form of a video camera) of a robot lowered on to the seabed.
Oil from such sub sea wells is pumped to a floating pier to which ships can anchor in the open sea making it possible to load safely in the Campos Basin.
These have been very important in leading our deep sea drilling because they enable us to go into production within a year of discovery giving quick returns says Jardim.
According to Petrobras officials production costs for Marlim are Dollars 8 per barrel competitive with other offshore operations.
Deep sea production will be the biggest contributor in the company s plans to increase production from 650 000 barrels per day to 1m by the end of 1994.
We want to go deeper still says Ernesto Weber former Petrobras chief.
The company aims to break the 2 000m depth mark by the end of this decade.
Wimpey s specialist offshore engineers have begun an operation to avert toxic danger to marine life in the Atlantic Ocean.
Underwater grouting supplied by the transatlantic arm of WIMPEY GEOTECH is forming the nucleus of a USDollars 6m (Pounds 3.
3m) salvage operation to recover toxic chemicals off Cape May in New Jersey.
Four containers holding a total of 441 drums of arsenic trioxide and sodium cyanide slipped from the decks of carqo vessel Santa Clara 1 during a storm in January 1992.
The containers settled 30 miles offshore spilling the drums in a prime fishing zone which is also the habitat of the endangered Right whale and the Kemp Ridley sea turtle.
Working at depths of 40 metres remote control vehicles fitted with robotic arms will place the chemical drums into oversized caskets.
The space around the drums will then be filled with a high density cement grout mixed by Wimpey Geotech on board the recovery vessel and pumped into place using specialist equipment and services.
The grout will be allowed to harden before the caskets are brought to the surface for salvage and safe disposal.
Work started in March and is expected to continue for three months.
Help is at hand for many thousands of disabled people who are unable to feed themselves writes Andrew Baxter.
Handy 1 designed by Mike Topping development manager at the University of Keele s rehabilitation robotics project enables severely disabled people to eat unaided.
The product a robotic arm with contoured spoon attached to an electronic control unit on an adjustable stand allows users to eat at their own pace.
A stalk switch mounted on a flexible gooseneck can be operated by hand or head movements giving the user control.
Earlier this month Handy 1 won the Pounds 7 000 Institution of Electrical Engineers Prize for Helping Disabled People.
FT 05 JUN 92 Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (6).
Machines are now used for tasks beyond spot welding Robots.
ROBOTS have become an established part of the vehicle manufacturing scene over the past 15 years.
The motor industry accounts for as much as 40 per cent of the 450 000 installed industrial robots worldwide but their use is changing and applications are expanding.
The traditional picture of long lines of robots each making billions of spot welds on car bodies in a working life of eight to 10 years is still true but only half the story.
Those same welding robots are as likely to be grouped in flexible manufacturing cells and capable of handling a wide range of models in quick succession.
At the same time smaller robots are increasingly being used in engine assembly where their ability to do quality repetitive work with a precision of 1 100th of a millimetre is much in demand.
Robots are being used in final assembly work and paint spraying and suppliers hope to be able to develop these markets now that the technology has been proven.
There is an emerging trend for robots to be used in automotive sub contracting prompted by the vehicle manufacturers need to be as confident in the consistency and quality of out sourced components as for their own work.
The shorter lives of car models prompted by increased competition in the industry and the Japanese producers early efforts to reduce product development times are changing the use and design of robots.
The traditional practice of replacing a robot after two model cycles may have been appropriate when each car model was lasting six to eight years.
But with model lives reduced to three to four years users want to keep their robots for further models and thus want increased flexibility according to Dr Axel Gerhardt a senior board member at the holding company for Kuka Germany s largest robot supplier.
Many of the latest trends in the use of robotics originated in Japan where labour shortages have spurred much greater penetration of robots into industry overall compared with Europe and the US.
But robot suppliers such as ABB Robotics the largest in Europe believe the European automotive industry is as enthusiastic a user of robotic automation as its Japanese counterpart.
However some of the more recent applications of robots are less prevalent in Europe giving an opportunity to suppliers if they can convince producers of the economic benefits.
the UK is a long way behind the US and the rest of Europe in the use of robots in the paint shop says Mr Mike Wilson UK sales and marketing director at GMFanuc Robotics.
The versatility of modern industrial robots for tasks that go beyond spot welding is illustrated by Kuka s involvement in final assembly of the Citroen XM.
Following painting robots dismount the doors and tailgate with the aid of sensors for completion on separate trim lines.
the cockpit is picked up by robot from an automatic guided vehicle inserted through the door and then bolted to the body by a second robot.
Robots are used for applying the adhesive sealants and for fitting the glass exactly into the body aperture with the aid of ultrasonic scanners.
seats are inserted by robot after measuring the exact position of the body by means of tactile sensors wheels are mounted and doors and tailgate refitted.
Some of these tasks are difficult for robots because of the nature of final assembly.
Robots are having to operate in a less structured environment says Mr Wilson and deal with less defined objects such as seats.
Another problem at least outside Japan is that labour is available and costs less than in skilled manufacturing areas.
So robot suppliers have to find applications that create added value says Mr Stelio Demark head of ABB Robotics.
There are still opportunities for greater use of robots further up the production line.
Relatively new processes such as laser cutting and water jet cutting are likely to become more prevalent in association with robots especially for working with plastics and new advanced composites.
Mr Demark sees a substantial increase in automated arc welding in the automotive industry and sub suppliers.
And Comau the Italian robotics and systems group expects some interesting investments in the body area prompted by the increased need for new models according to Mr Massimo Mattucci vice president for engineering and marketing.
In paint spraying says Mr Demark robots have hardly scratched the surface.
Last year ABB strengthened its position in the robotic painting market with the acquisition of Graco in the US but GMFanuc a US Japanese concern and Behr of Germany have strong positions.
The flexibility of robots to handle model changes will be the key to their further implementation in the car body area.
In engine and transmission production robots are becoming better established and Mr Mattucci suggests a new generation of engines prompted by tougher environmental regulations could be the spur to further investment in robots.
However an increasing portion of business for robot suppliers seems likely to come from refurbishment of existing robots rather than new purchases as customers seek maximum value from their manufacturing investments.
In the past three or four years this has been a growing trend of robot refitting and modification in the motor industry carried out during model changeovers and restoring robots to previous levels of accuracy and productivity.
FT 05 JUN 92 Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (7).
New trends and challenges Developments in paints and coatings.
ENVIRONMENTAL pressures may be increasing on industry as a whole but few processes are closer to the sharp end of the debate than the motor industry s paint shops.
Based on annual production of 10m cars European manufacturers are using an estimated 70 000 tons of solvent during the painting processes the majority of which is released into the atmosphere.
Emission controls are being tightened up and common EC wide legislation is expected.
But the environmental factor is only one of several trends which makes the paint shop one of the most complex and rapidly changing areas of modern vehicle manufacturing.
The need for better looking and longer lasting finishes for a higher level of automation to increase productivity and more sophisticated control systems to enable greater production flexibility are all increasing the challenges for equipment suppliers.
The major suppliers Durr of Germany with its sister company Behr the Asea Brown Boveri subsidiaries Flakt and Ransburg and Taikisha of Japan are adapting to the growing demand for turnkey packages while keeping abreast of a multi disciplinary process involving everything from computers to sludge removal systems.
Recent installations in the UK motor industry illustrate the trends clearly.
Vauxhall s newly commissioned Pounds 60m paint unit at its Ellesmere Port Astra manufacturing plant has Europe s first operational MAP (Manufacturing and Automation Protocol) 3.
MAP is a means of maintaining efficient reliable high speed communications between factory floor computers.
The plant also has an innovative flocculation system designed to recover paint overspray developed as an experiment by Air Industrie a subsidiary of GEC Alsthom and GM s European Technical Development Centre.
Work is continuing on ways to use the recovered paint perhaps as a filler material in compounded sound deadener pads.
Further south at Iveco Ford Truck s Langley plant the Iveco New Cargo line has a fully automated Behr paint spraying system equipped with four robots and claimed to be the first in Europe to spray a complete cab automatically in a single pass.
The system designed for frequent colour changes can handle 16 body styles and 24 colours.
Bodies are fed to the spray booth at random and the required style and colour programme called up by an operator on a simple keypad at the entrance to the spray booth.
Thereafter the complete spraying operation is fully automatic and computer controlled.
Pre treatment ahead of painting is also the target of investment.
At Rover s Cowley factory a new body pre treatment plant installed by Durr has replaced the old spray dip system with a new full immersion pre treatment process producing better corrosion protection.
Meanwhile at the luxury end of the industry Rolls Royce has installed the latest Behr two component paint system.
Known as 2K the system mixes precise quantities of paint and hardener immediately before they are applied to the car body.
All these systems offer environmental benefits the 2K process for example requires a lower stoving temperature than typical single component materials and thus consumes less energy.
According to Durr the cost of new automotive paint plants will need to increase by 20 per cent or Pounds 1m Pounds 2m to accommodate new UK emission regulations operators have until September to submit approved plans to local authorities for complying with the 1990 Environmental Protection Act.
The response to the regulations takes a number of forms according to Mr John Barlow Durr s UK managing director.
On the materials side there is a move away from solvent based paints to water based paints water based primers have been used for some years.
Solvents are used to get the paint airborne and their replacement by water based systems requires new sprayers and a completely new stainless steel plant.
Where solvents are used paints with higher solid contents have been developed to reduce emissions.
This is a further advantage of the 2K process which has a high solids content of up to 70 per cent.
New paint technologies such as powder coating are also being tried but in this case implementation in car plants is a long way off says Mr Barlow.
The emission problem is solved but the spraying equipment is too wasteful.
Controlling and treating emissions whether of air borne solvents or paint polluted water is the other main area where technology is being driven by the emission regulations and tougher rules.
This has led to demand for more sophisticated scrubbing and incineration systems such as catalytic incinerators and water recycling equipment.
Yamazaki s family affair Machine tool industry.
IT is a characteristic of the machine tool industry that from the top of the boom to the bottom of the slump the market can halve.
We need to lower the break even point so that we can survive that says Mr Teruyuki Yamazaki one of the world s leading machine tool makers.
Sitting in his sumptuous office paintings by Ingres Delacroix and Boucher sculpture by Rodin furniture old English he scarcely looks hard up.
His company Yamazaki Mazak is running at 60 per cent capacity.
The present slump in machine tool orders is partly a function of over investment by Japanese industry in the bubble years.
In the two years 1987 89 according to the Japan Machine Tool Builders Association domestic sales of machine tools virtually doubled.
In the first four months of this year domestic orders are down by nearly half.
Mr Tsunehiko Yamazaki vice president of the private family owned business and Teruyuki s brother says.
In the history of the industry there have been plenty of examples of famous manufacturers dating back to the Industrial Revolution going under.
Yamazaki is expanding capacity at its main plant at Minokamo in southern Japan.
It has just opened its first Asian manufacturing operation in Singapore.
In the past three years capital expenditure has averaged Dollars 100m or about 10 per cent of turnover.
This year it will be about the same not because we wanted it but because we were committed to it says Teruyuki.
Yamazaki takes to the extreme the principle of automated manufacture.
We can generate Dollars 10m of output with the same overheads as for Dollars 1m says Teruyuki.
The physical process this involves is slightly spooky to watch.
Machine tools are of course machines for making machines.
The Minokamo plant takes this a step further.
In essence it is one large machine making machine to make machines.
At one end of the plant unmanned loaders some 10 feet long and three feet high roam around the floor playing tunes to warn any stray humans of their approach.
One rolls up to the warehouse counter playing Annie Laurie and deposits a couple of machined body parts.
Another robot a spindly giant about 100 feet high whisks the parts up and stacks them under the roof.
The loader picks up a pallet of small parts and moves off again.
In a culture which still does not permit lay offs this gives a useful element of flexibility.
When the plant is running below capacity as now we can simply eliminate one of the unmanned night shifts.
The process of automation Teruyuki says has further to go.
The cost of labour is rising and working hours in Japan are going to be reduced.
So whether we like it or not the number of craftsmen is going to be reduced.
Even if the technology isn t cost effective yet it will be one day.
It is often alleged that in terms of quality and precision Japanese machine tools still do not match the more expensive hand built machines from Germany and Switzerland.
People sometimes say that such a precise machine should be hand made.
But where unmanned operation is possible a lot of talk to the contrary is sour grapes.
Perhaps some people without the electronic knowledge are afraid to adapt it into their technology.
We aren t Yamazaki s other chief defence against the roller coaster nature of its industry has always been its international diversity.
Japan accounts for only some 30 per cent of its sales with 25 per cent coming from the US and a further 25 per cent in Europe.
Geographical spread is of limited use this time round.
In the 30 years I ve been in this business says Tsunehiko this is the first time I ve seen all the world economies going down together.
Although Japan and Europe are poor at present the US and Far East are not so bad.
But that still means that two out of our three main markets are down which is a serious problem.
In the past two months there has been a small improvement in order intake in the UK and the US which we couldn t have expected four or five months ago.
But in Germany and Japan orders are weak compared with what we expected six months ago.
If we d been listed when the stock market was booming we d have had cheaper money.
But the problem is that all that cheap money was someone else s.
The machine tool industry s continuous demand for investment means the return on equity is typically low perhaps lower than would be accepted by a public company.
It is doubtless no coincidence that many of Yamazaki s competitors elsewhere in the world are private as well.
Making machine tools is a job which should be handed down from generation to generation.
Sometimes a machine tool company is sold to a conglomerate because the son is not interested and it fades away.
Robot rubber tappers are ready to march Labour shortages in Malaysia are doing away with the traditional jebung.
Strange things are happening on Malaysia s rubber plantations.
Before long robots could be moving down the lines of trees collecting the latex which goes to help make the world s tyres and condoms raincoats and surgical gloves.
Malaysia s rubber growers are facing serious problems.
With one of the fastest growing economies in the Asian region Malaysia is rapidly industrialising.
A combination of acute labour shortages in the agricultural sector plus a period of low prices has forced many rubber growers to abandon their trees.
Since 1988 Malaysia s rubber production has fallen by as much as 26 per cent to 1.
Technicians at the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia are now battling to prevent any further decline in what was once the country s premier industry.
The traditional method of extracting latex the milky white raw rubber liquid is for the tapper to use his jebung or tapping knife to cut a groove at about 45 degrees round a quarter or half section of the tree.
The cut must not be too deep or the wood or cambium of the tree will be damaged.
The cut must also be done in such a way as to allow a steady flow of latex into the collecting vessel.
In the conventional system tapping takes place every other day.
It is carried out in the early morning when the pressure which forces the latex out of the tree is at its strongest.
a skilled tapper can tap between 400 and 700 trees in three hours.
He then returns to collect the latex and take it for processing into rubber bales at the factory.
RRI calculates that labour now accounts for about 70 per cent of rubber production costs.
The tappers many of them descendants of Tamil workers imported from southern India and Ceylon now Sri Lanka by the British are an ageing group.
Rubber plantations are hot and often full of insects.
most young people prefer factory or office jobs.
A new method of mechanised tapping could provide the answer to many of Malaysia s problems.
Under the new system a battery driven machine the size of a computer keyboard remote control may be introduced later and fitted with a timing device is tied to each tree running round the trunk on a notched wire.
Every 24 hours a small needle is pressed into the bark starting a latex flow.
Puncture tapping could be one of the ways to preserve our rubber industry says Zahid Mohammad a researcher at RRI s 1 300 hectare experimental station at Sungei Buloh outside Kuala Lumpur.
It can be left on the tree for a year and checked occasionally by the latex gatherers.
The difficult business of manual tapping could be eliminated.
The latex flow is not so strong as with the conventional cut method.
One version of the machine comes with a small gas canister attached.
At intervals the gas is funnelled into the tree to stimulate latex flow.
The trees are very like humans says Zahid.
In the same way that you have to squeeze the arm and find the right vein to get a good blood sample so we have to establish the right place to puncture the tree and apply the right stimulants to encourage the flow.
8m hectares of its land planted with rubber amounting to about 700m trees.
If the machines are mass produced RRI calculates that the cost of each will be less than MDollars 5 (Pounds 1.
Only about 20 per cent of Malaysia s rubber production comes from plantations the rest is carried out by many thousands of smallholders with individual plots of between one and two hectares.
Smallholders tend to be considerably less efficient than the plantations and they are resistant to change.
Some time ago RRI invented a motorised tapping machine.
The tapper would cut the tree in the conventional way but could work much faster covering nearly 1 000 trees in a morning.
But machines distributed by RRI were not serviced properly by the smallholders and at MDollars 250 were considered to be too expensive.
While RRI continues to look at other machine driven methods including the possibility of using robot machines to work up and down the rows of trees it is also working on other projects.
At one time rubber trees had to be left to grow for eight years before tapping could start.
Now trees of between four and five years are producing latex.
Through cloning and seed research it is hoped to bring the maturation period down still further while preserving the existing production lifespan of more than 30 years.
FT 26 JUN 93 Calling Dr Dalek your patient is waiting.
A revolution in surgery where robots are taking an increased role in the operating theatre.
YOU ARE about to have the anaesthetic before an operation to remove a brain tumour.
That question will soon be more than a fantasy because surgery is in the early stages of a technical revolution.
The first step has been the spread of keyhole operations over the past five years.
Instead of cutting open the patient the surgeon uses instruments guided by telescope through tiny incisions.
Soon it will be possible to work by remote control on patients thousands of miles away using a combination of telecommunications and virtual reality.
The most striking sign of change though is the way surgeons are starting to welcome robotic assistants into their operating theatres.
Within the past few months robots have helped to carry out hip replacements in California prostate operations in London and brain surgery in Grenoble France.
Later this year gall bladder removal hernia repair and a variety of other abdominal operations will be added to the list of robotic accomplishments.
Despite this even the most enthusiastic surgeons say it is likely to be several years before they would consider leaving a robot to operate on its own.
The late Hap Paul chief inventor of California s Robodoc cautioned.
We have to move very slowly and carefully because one false move by a surgical robot and this whole technology is set back by many years.
Robodoc is the world s largest and best financed project in medical robotics.
Since November 10 patients at Sutter general hospital in Sacramento have had hip replacements with the aid of Robodoc a 250 lb automaton programmed to carve the cavity for an implant in the thigh bone.
Although Paul died two months ago (at only 44) Integrated Surgical Systems the company he founded with financial and scientific backing from IBM is forging ahead.
It is waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administration to carry out a clinical trial of Robodoc with 300 patients in three US hospitals.
The most important reason is that an electronic arm is capable of precision well beyond that of the steadiest and best trained surgeon.
ISS hopes to prove this through its trial in which patients will be allocated at random into one group treated by Robodoc and another receiving conventional hip replacements.
Surgical robots promise more than improvements in existing procedures says Patrick Finlay managing director of Armstrong Projects a fledgling UK medical robotics company based at Beaconsfield near London.
The reduced collateral damage and greater precision of the robot will make it possible to do operations that would otherwise be too risky to contemplate.
For example a tumour very close to the optic nerve can be tackled without making the patient blind.
Several different types of surgical robot are under development around the world.
Robodoc is an active robot that actually cuts human tissue.
Orthopaedic work is an attractive application because the robot is working on hard tissue that doesn t move if you prod it notes Brian Davies an engineer specialising in medical robotics at Imperial College London.
Most operations however involve cutting soft tissues a task that is more delicate than carving bone.
So far only passive robots have been used for this type of surgery.
They may move instruments inside the patient under the surgeon s direction but they do not yet wield a scalpel or laser beam.
An example is Laparobot which Armstrong Projects is developing with Mark Ornstein a surgeon at the London Clinic.
Laparobot will give someone carrying out keyhole surgery the impression of walking around inside the patient s body using tele presence techniques.
A keyhole surgeon views the operating site with a miniature video camera at the end of a thin optical tube inserted into the body through a puncture hole (typically in the tummy button).
This instrument called a laparoscope projects the scene on to a TV screen above the patient.
Normally an assistant has to hold the laparoscope and move it when the surgeon needs a different view.
But Laparobot itself senses the position of the surgeon s head and moves the image accordingly.
If the surgeon pushes a foot button and moves his head to the left the robot will change the view inside the patient s body.
For this year s initial trials at the London Clinic Laparobot will work with an existing TV monitor but the next stage will be for the surgeon to wear a helmet mounted display which will give the impression of being immersed in the operating environment.
As he looks around the scene will change as though he were actually inside the abdominal cavity.
Further in the future lies the prospect of linking the surgeon s finger movements to the control of micro instruments within the body.
Laparobot will make the surgery more efficient less stressful for the surgeon faster and more accurate and with less risk of damage to the patient says Ornstein.
Armstrong is also working with Professor David Thomas of London s National Hospital for Neurology to develop Neurobot a system for carrying out brain surgery.
By the end of this year they hope to have demonstrated an image guided robot that will help the surgeon position his instruments at the correct point in the brain to perform the operation.
A surgical robot is given as much prior information as possible about relevant parts of the patient s body usually from a CT or MRI scan.
Its computer converts this into a digital model of the patient.
Although the surgeon works out in advance the path of the operation based on the computer model the system must be flexible enough to respond to unexpected events.
Neurobot for example will have a sensor inside the patient s head.
If it detects the presence of an unexpected blood vessel it will prompt the surgeon for advice.
Its software might propose a modified route taking the new information into account but the robot will not go ahead until the surgeon has signalled his approval.
Finlay says a good indicator of progress in surgical robotics will be the increasing amount of freedom given to the robot.
Although the surgeon will never cease to participate it is realistic to envisage a situation similar to the relationship between an airliner captain and his autopilot in which the human provides a supervisory and monitoring role and is available to take over the critical manoeuvres he says.
In tele surgery projects under way in the US and France an experienced surgeon uses a video link to supervise a junior doctor in a hospital hundreds of miles away.
The surgeon could equally well supervise a distant robot although local medical and nursing staff would still have to be present in case the system crashed.
Everyone involved in medical robotics is obsessed with safety.
Yet as Davies points out there are no agreed safety standards for robots operating on people whereas regulations require industrial robots to work in metal cages.
(The fact that two workers in Japan have been killed by factory robots going out of control shows the need for such rules).
One is that it s acceptable to start out with an industrial robot provided you put in a top level software system to bring the thing to a halt in the event of some failure.
I think you need to re develop the robot from the basic servo level upwards building in safety at every level.
That means giving the surgical robot the equivalent of a metal cage with duplicated software and hardware constraints to prevent it moving beyond pre defined limits.
And it must move slowly enough for the supervising surgeon s hand to hit the stop button in time to avoid damage if all the safety systems fail.
Growing concerns about the financial costs of medical care are forcing both public health authorities and private hospitals to demand evidence that new technology will deliver benefits that outweigh its expense.
Drugs have long had to justify their effectiveness in large scale clinical trials but until now new surgical procedures and medical equipment have been introduced with remarkably little systematic assessment.
A report on medical research earlier this year by the UK government s Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost) pointed out.
With the exception of pharmaceuticals demands for evaluation have been questioned because it stands to reason that the new techniques will be better.
Peter Doyle research director of ICI and chairman of Acost s medical research committee gives keyhole surgery as an example of a procedure that has been introduced haphazardly without proper evaluation.
The report says the National Health Service should require all new medical devices to be assessed under controlled conditions and their cost effectiveness measured.
Miles Irving professor of surgery at Manchester University s Hope Hospital says that such assessment is all the more necessary because surgeons face strong consumer pressure to introduce new procedures before they have been properly evaluated.
Hap Paul felt that pressure when he was looking for sites to test Robodoc.
Tertiary care centres in the US the big university hospitals see this as an advance that will help them attract patients he said.
So we have to be very careful in choosing our sites to make sure it s not just a publicity stunt for them.
Indeed says John Hutton a health economist at York University US experience shows that patients regard hi tech equipment in itself as an indicator of quality whether or not there is any clinical evidence to prove its superiority.
Therefore hospitals compete by buying more and more flashy machines and their charges shoot up far faster than inflation.
The introduction of an internal market in the NHS is likely to lead to similar competitive pressures in the UK.
ISS believes its clinical trial will enable orthopaedic hospitals to justify buying a Dollars 750 000 Robodoc doing 400 hip replacements a year on the basis that implants from robotic operations last longer than those inserted manually and so save money in the long run.
But the recent history of medical research and technology from antibiotics to diagnostic scanners shows that while each development can be justified in isolation as being cost effective the overall result is to add substantially to the financial burden of health care by creating new demand from patients and adding to the number of elderly people in the population.
Two decades from now only second class patients will choose to have a purely manual operation.
But in contrast to labour saving robots in a car factory surgical robots can only make the process more expensive.
Enthusiastic medical technologists can answer any question except one.
Industry on the cutting edge The waterjet process has come of age and is creating interest worldwide.
At the LVD machine tool factory in Belgium engineers have produced a jigsaw puzzle map of Europe adorned with the company logo that has been cut on a piece of blue foam rubber about half an inch thick.
A long way further east in Ukraine automatic dismantling lines designed by Ingersoll Rand the big US industrial equipment group will soon be in place to begin dismantling more than 200 000 tons of surplus Ukrainian ammunition.
LVD is one of the most recent entrants while I R was one of the pioneers in waterjet cutting technology.
This process is in use by or being considered by a wide range of industries from fish finger manufacturers to stone and glass cutters.
So far automotive and aerospace companies have been the biggest users of the process.
As is also the case with most technologies involving water the basics of the process are simple.
Water is filtered then passed through a powerful pump and intensifier.
The result is a stream of water travelling at speeds ranging between Mach two and three.
Alone the water will cut through paper frozen foods thin wood car interiors sponge and rubber and certain plastics but if abrasives are added it will cut through steel up to 150mm thick.
Waterjet cutting is not that new I R introduced its first waterjet cutting systems in 1971 and found some of its first applications in the furniture industry.
But the technology has come of age and is generating increased interest worldwide.
I R is one of the leading players along with another pioneer and US rival Flow International.
This pair dominates the industry which also includes companies such as Indiana based ASI Robotic Systems and Bystronic Maschinen of Switzerland.
There are many smaller players offering niche products and buying in the pumps.
ln the 1970s the system was perceived to be too slow says Paul Etchells UK Ireland and Benelux sales manager for ABB I R Robotised Waterjet Systems a joint venture between I R and Asea Brown Boveri the Swiss Swedish engineering group.
But the initial problems have been resolved and since the early 1980s we ve had highly reliable systems being used in high volume production he says.
The introduction of abrasives has been the main driving force for the industrial development of waterjet cutting.
A powdered abrasive known as garnet is introduced through a tube into a tiny mixing chamber before the water leaves the nozzle.
The water then acts as a carrying agent for the abrasive which moves almost as fast as the water and does the cutting.
This process has coincided with the growing use by automotive and aerospace companies of materials ranging from sophisticated plastics and composites to aluminium and titanium.
It has offered faster and more accurate cutting than traditional methods such as sawing routing or cutting with a hot wire.
At Rockwell International for example I R s waterjet cutters were used on titanium components for the B 1B bomber which would previously have been produced through a four stage process of inking scribing hand cutting and filing.
Waterjet cutting eliminated the first two stages and reduced the filing so that 12 parts could be cut and finished in the time taken to polish one part produced by sawing.
Aerospace companies have also found that by using waterjets they can cut composite materials without delaminating the edges.
It would be like having a piece of cardboard with a wet edge says Ivan Lockett LVD s UK managing director.
The second important development has been the tie ups between robotics suppliers and vendors of waterjet cutting systems such as the two year old ABB I R joint venture.
Once attached to a sophisticated computer controlled robot a waterjet can move around and across a three dimensional part such as a car dashboard cutting the outline and creating the holes for the instruments.
Along with car carpets and headliners the inside of the roof dashboards are the most popular applications for waterjet cutting in the automotive industry.
The advantages of waterjet cutting include its flexibility and easy maintenance.
It produces no dust or toxic fumes and the component is not affected by heat distortion.
There is no cutting tool to wear out although the nozzle has to be changed occasionally.
The process is noisy although that can be reduced by cutting underwater with the component just below the water surface.
Although the basic running cost without abrasive is only Pounds 3 an hour the cost rises to Pounds 10 Pounds 18 with abrasive says Etchells.
Also while the process uses very small amounts of water because the jet is so thin the abrasive cannot be recycled and a typical metal cutting application will use 1kg every three minutes according to LVD.
Research is under way in Germany to find ways to recycle the abrasive which ends up wet and contaminated with bits of the component.
For thin metals for example steel up to 16mm cutting with a laserjet can be five to 10 times faster.
Beyond that however laserjets are much slower and rarely used while the shininess of metals such as copper brass and aluminium make it possible to cut only very thin sheets with lasers.
There are occasional problems too with the continuation of the waterjet after it has cut through the component.
In three dimensional work situations can arise where the jet will damage a part of the robot but cutting in water may provide the solution.
Nevertheless waterjet cutting has built up an impressive reference list after more than 20 years.
Most US built airliners for example will have components produced by waterjet.
Boeing will be using three big ASI robotic waterjet cutting machines for the tail section supports and other large parts for the new 777 airliner.
In I R s Ukrainian contract high pressure waterjets will remove explosives from tank ammunition artillery shells and mortar rounds without detonating it.
The machines have been ordered by Alliant Techsystems the big Minnesota based munitions manufacturer.
LVD meanwhile entered the waterjet cutting market through an agreement with ASI last year to market the systems in Europe.
The Belgian company is one of the world s biggest producers of machinery for cutting punching and bending sheet metal and sees waterjet cutting as complementary to its laserjet cutters.
In September it introduced the Aquarius range of machines mainly for cutting flat surfaces but will also market ASI s 3 D systems in Europe.
According to Jean Pierre Lefebvre LVD s president Europe is a step behind the US in the application of waterjet cutting and the process could represent 10 per cent of LVD s business in 10 years.
In the future waterjet cutting is likely to become increasingly integrated with other parts of the production process.
This is already happening ASI s system for the 777 tail section for example inspects the parts after they are cut using a probe from Renishaw of the UK to carry out co ordinate measuring.
Not to be outdone the ABB I R joint venture recently won an order from Statoil Europarts based in Sweden for a robotised system that cuts cleans washes and dries vehicle instrument panels.
It claims that this is the first time all four operations have been carried out in the same piece of equipment.

Untouched by human hands Intelligent machines are a familiar sight on motor production lines.
Now they are expected to turn their hands to the high speed packing of food and drink Robots.
A PLATOON of raw recruits drafted in to the French army to pack combat rations are having to look lively.
Each ration consists of 18 items ranging from a pack of biscuits and a tin of meat to purification tablets and a miniature stove.
In order to keep the fighting troops fed the new recruits have to pack rations at the rate of 24 a minute.
The luckless legionnaires are 13 industrial robots part of a FFr25m automated packaging and palletising line built for the army by ABB Robotics.
Three robots unload boxes of goodies from pallets on to a conveyor which delivers them to the ration packing station.
Here another nine machines using videos cameras to recognise the right items pack them into ration boxes in just 2.
The 13 robots stack the ration boxes on to a pallet for delivery to the barracks.
Five different menus can be put on one pallet to match a barracks order.
David Marshall responsible for customer training at ABB Robotics in Milton Keynes fervently hopes that the food drinks and confectionery industry including even army rations will become the next big market for robots.
The whole robot industry has depended on the automotive industry since day one.
Look at the figures 80 per cent of the world market for robots is in the automotive and automotive supply industry.
We are looking to the food industry to perform as well as the automotive industry.
The reason for his optimism is that industrial robots have become more attractive to the food industry for packing and handling particularly in the light of new health and safety regulations restricting the weight of loads that can be lifted manually.
They have become faster reliable more accurate and easier to incorporate into a production line.
Better motor control software has allowed ABB for example to squeeze 25 per cent more performance out of the same robot.
Robots are also simpler to program operate and maintain.
And prices are coming down to a level where paybacks are acceptable to the food industry.
The food drink and confectionery industry is surviving on low cost female labour.
Despite their flexibility using people to pack those army rations would have been a nightmare says Marshall.
Although robots are flexible and reliable so far they have been too slow and too expensive says Marshall.
But what is good for the food and drinks makers is good for manufacturing industry.
Mike Wilson marketing manager at Fanuc Robotics in Coventry says of the improvements in robot performance.
Our new ARC Mate welding robot for example is 30 per cent cheaper in real terms than a similar model three years ago.
A spot welding robot can now do one spot weld every 1.
Ten years ago says Wilson it would have taken three.
Some of the gain has come from the improved mechanical performance of robots faster acceleration and deceleration and better overshoot behaviour.
And some has come from better integration of the robot into the process says Wilson.
The spot welding gun will begin to close before it gets to the weld for instance.
The load capacity and accuracy of robots has come on in leaps and bounds too.
That was unheard of 10 years ago for an electric robot says Wilson.
Reliability has also greatly improved he says.
Weld wires occasionally get stuck in the solidified weld pool at the end of a weld.
A few years ago as the robot moved away it would rip the welding torch off the arm.
Today says Wilson wire stick sensors prevent this and automatically send a pulse of current down the wire to burn it free.
A similar example of improved capability is scratch start.
If a bead of silica from the flux gets left on the end of the welding wire it will not strike an arc and has to be snipped off manually.
Today s robot will sense this and scratch the tip of the wire along the component to rub the bead off.
It will then go back to the correct place on the weld and start welding.
Overall says Wilson the cost to performance ratio of robots today is considerably better than a few years ago.
Most people now buy a robot package which includes some process engineering expertise and an application software package.
This avoids a lot of programming and makes them quicker to install and easier to operate.
When Vauxhall bought 120 Fanuc welding robots for its new Astra line at the Ellesmere Port plant a couple of years ago it handed them on to six companies building the welding lines.
We designed a software package for Vauxhall that would interface the robots with all the hardware and provide an operator interface.
That forced all the line builders to use the robots in the same way.
It made maintenance a lot simpler and saved money.
We only had to write the software once and copy it six times.
Yet despite the advances in robot technology Britain has one of the smallest robot populations of all the industrialised nations around 7 600 compared with Germany s 39 000 and Japan s staggering 350 000.
Even the former USSR has more robots per employee in manufacturing industry than Britain.
The problem is the 18 month to two year paybacks demanded in Britain says Wilson compared with as long as five years in Japan.
It is very difficult to justify any capital expenditure on an 18 month payback.
The international Human Genome Project aimed at mapping and identifying the estimated 100 000 human genes is stimulating rapid advances in laboratory automation.
The latest comes from a collaboration between the Imperial Cancer Research Fund a London based charity and two UK companies.
Linear Drives of Rayleigh Essex and Genetix of Christchurch Dorset.
The three partners have developed a robotic system to help scientists produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetics research.
The system locates clone colonies growing on culture plates with a CCD camera.
It then picks healthy looking colonies with a block of 96 spring loaded pins and moves the cells to dishes for further growth and analysis.
