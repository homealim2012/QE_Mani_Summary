19910508000000000	FT  08 MAY 91 / Bangladeshi PM calls on army to tackle aid effort. THE inexperienced civilian government of Mrs Khaleda Zia yesterday called in senior Bangladeshi army officers to help tackle the devastation caused by last week's cyclone. The army has ruled Bangladesh for most of its 21-year history and Mrs Zia took office just two months ago. Although the new prime minister retains control of the administration, steps have been initiated to 'improve co-ordination' with senior officers. Lt-Gen Nooruddin Khan, chief of the army staff, returned from a visit to China over the weekend and has taken personal charge of relief and rescue operations, although overall supervision remains with a central co-ordination committee headed by Mrs Zia. The general has already held a meeting with formation commanders. By official count 125,730 people were killed and an estimated 10m left homeless. A complete accounting of the dead is unlikely because many were swept out to sea. Mrs Zia yesterday told reporters that a 'master plan' for rehabilitation work would be finalised within a couple of days and that rescue and relief operations had now been intensified with an improvement in the weather. In addition to the six helicopters being used by the government, 11 more have arrived from India and other countries. However, there is now less need for air drops of supplies as floods recede from most of the affected areas. Since it is now possible to send medical teams to these areas, hopes are that the much-feared epidemics will be controlled. But millions of survivors continue to face shortages of food, drinking water and medicines so the next few days will be crucial. Chittagong port, which had been blocked by sunken vessels, was yesterday declared partly open. This will enable the authorities to use the sea routes for relief operations.
19910507000000000	FT  07 MAY 91 / Bangladesh rocked by fresh gales. FRESH GALES were yesterday causing further destruction along the coast of Bangladesh, where nearly 10m people made homeless by last week's cyclone still await relief from hunger, thirst and disease. The death toll continues to mount and some officials say as many as 500,000 people may have died. A lack of communications and bad weather have hampered the relief effort and delayed an accurate assessment of the disaster. Bangladesh's entire armed forces, police and home guard have been mobilised for the effort, but their resources are woefully inadequate. Local relief is supplemented by a trickle of help from abroad. Helicopters, including three given by India, two by Pakistan and six from Bangladesh itself, are dropping supplies for the survivors. Aid amounting to Dollars 130m (Pounds 76.7m) has been promised by the US, the European Community, Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia. There are hurdles in the way of the immediate relief work and future recovery. Having just emerged from a period of political turmoil, the country is struggling to tackle yet another natural calamity. Bangladesh's inexperienced leadership and inefficient bureaucracy is ill-equipped to tackle a human tragedy of frightening dimensions. Foreign relief agencies in the capital Dhaka point out that the country lacks the capacity to absorb large-scale aid and say that international agencies will have to become involved in the relief work. The only supplies reaching survivors are by air. Means of communication barely exist and much of the country's infrastructure has been lost. All roads and bridges have been destroyed. The damage to the infrastructure and to crops and livestock could exceed the present estimate of Dollars 1bn, a crippling burden on an economy with a population growing at about 2.5 per cent annually, but with only a 3.5 per cent growth in gross national product last year. More than 200,000 square miles of the country were inundated. There is virtually no livestock left. The country's winter crop, much of it ready for harvesting, has been destroyed. Last year's food grain production of 10.9m tonnes will fall sharply in 1991-92 and further imports will be needed. Coastal embankments built as part of flood-protection schemes have been destroyed, as well as irrigation projects, rural water supply and electricity stations. The economy will be particularly badly hit by the damage to the 70 foreign exchange-earning units in the export-processing zone at Chittagong. Tidal waves have virtually washed away their stocks and machines. Bangladesh's lucrative shrimp industry at the port of Cox's Bazar has been wiped out. It too will take time and money to rebuild. In Chittagong port, sunken vessels clog up the main channel and quays, halting all trade. A reluctance by foreign investors to put money into a cyclone-prone area is likely to hamper rebuilding efforts. Foreign exchange reserves have been partly shored up by the first tranche of a loan from the International Monetary Fund and are at a fairly comfortable Dollars 600m, worth about two months of imports. Thousands of Bangladeshis are returning to work in the Gulf and their remittances will add to the reserves, but they will be quickly depleted. Bangladesh already had enough economic troubles before the cyclone. Inflation, which reached 10 per cent last year, will be pushed higher by the scarcity of resources. Private investment, both internal and foreign, was already being held back until the new political leadership, in place for two months, clarifies its policies. For the present, long-term measures are taking second place to the immediate crisis.
19910504000000000	FT  04 MAY 91 / Cyclone may claim more victims in long wait for relief. THOUSANDS of people ma-rooned in Bangladesh's coastal areas could die in the next few days because of inadequate relief operations following the cyclone which struck the country on Monday. About 10m people were yesterday waiting for urgently needed supplies of food, drinking water and medicines as a token relief effort was initiated by countries including the US, Britain, India and Saudi Arabia. Relief is difficult to arrange as Chittagong port and airport are not fully operational. Chittagong itself is a ghost city. Millions of trees that gave it its famed green canopy have been swept away. A few are now just stilts, devoid of branches. The hinterland of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar - the area most seriously affected by the cyclone - are inaccessible by both sea and road. Millions of people are stranded in these areas. Eyewitnesses say thousands of naked survivors are frantically waving at passing helicopters. Other reports trickling into Dhaka, the capital, suggest that hundreds of thousands of hectares of land in the coastal regions and nearby islands have been devastated by the six-hour cyclone. As many as 100,000 people are estimated to have died. The cyclone destroyed thousands of dwellings, engulfed all wells and drinking water supplies, and destroyed crops ready to be harvested. In many areas there is no sign whatever of any habitation. Vast stretches of land are under six or seven feet of saline water, in which thousands of corpses and carcasses of cattle are putrifying, adding to the danger of disease. The stench is overpowering. As the Bangladesh government launched its own relief operation, appeals went out for an international effort if further disaster is to be averted. Six helicopters are dropping drinking water and medicines which will reach just one-tenth of the people seeking help. These people are threatened by epidemics, and diarrhoea has already claimed several hundred lives. In a special parliamentary debate yesterday on the disaster, Mrs Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's prime minister, admitted that transport problems and continuing bad weather were hampering relief operations. She declared 'a day of mourning' for today and appealed to all political parties to jointly work for the victims. Many members, including Sherikh Hasina, the opposition leader, were critical of the government's efforts to help the victims.
19920922000000000	FT  22 SEP 92 / World News in Brief: Storm hits Philippines. Tropical Storm Ted ripped across the Philippines, killing five people, demolishing houses and causing floods, landslides and volcanic mudflows.
19920828000000000	FT  28 AUG 92 / Cleaning up after Andrew. SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday to begin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole districts, killing two people and injuring dozens more, agencies report from Florida and New Orleans. However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need. Federal emergency officials acknowledged distribution problems, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card yesterday promised 'dramatic' improvements within 24 hours and President George Bush last night ordered troops to Florida, without specifying a number. The government estimated it would cost Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for residents displaced by the storm. Louisiana state officials said they had no overall count of storm-related injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 100. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was setting aside Dollars 77m to help Louisiana recover. Most of the storm's fury was spent against sparsely populated farming communities and swampland in the state, sparing it the widespread destruction caused in Florida, where 15 people died. Official estimates in Miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one Dade County resident in eight - a quarter of a million people. Andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early yesterday, moving across Mississippi state and heading for the north-eastern US. Several of Louisiana's main industries were affected, including those of oysters and alligators. Wildlife and fisheries secretary Joe Herring estimated a 50 per cent decline in the alligator industry. The cotton and sugar-cane crops were threatened, the state agriculture department said. Most Louisiana oil refineries, however, were barely affected and deliveries of crude oil were expected to resume yesterday.
19920827000000000	FT  27 AUG 92 / Hurricane batters southern US but lets insurers off lightly. HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.
19920826000000000	FT  26 AUG 92 / Hurricane damage put at Dollars 20bn as 2m people told to leave homes. DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans. Government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advised or ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas. The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causing billions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday was moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140 miles an hour. At least three people died on Sunday when Hurricane Andrew crossed the Bahamas. Ms Kate Hale, director of emergency services in Florida's Dade County, which bore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already caused Dollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 10bn) of damage. However, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early to assess the costs accurately. The US industry's Property Claims Service, the official compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tally of the Florida bill. A hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along 470 miles of Gulf coast from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas. Several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central Louisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or this morning. New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north. Much of America's oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal Texas and Louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down. These included British Petroleum's Belle Chasse plant in Louisiana. In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some 10-15 miles south of Miami. The town of Homestead, near the centre of the storm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base. Miami's city centre escaped with relatively light damage. More than 24 hours after the hurricane, some 825,000 households and businesses were still without power. The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the US industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State Farm Group and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck. These are also the leading property/casualty and home insurance groups in Louisiana, together with American International Group. A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company had roughly 20 per cent of the Florida market. The mutually-owned company has no reinsurance. Its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and its reserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary. According to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claims adjustment firm, other insurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are Hartford Insurance, Aetna and Travellers. Travellers said it had flown 50 claims adjusters in to Florida late on Monday and was assessing losses. About 12 per cent of Travellers' home insurance premium income came from Florida last year, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums. The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989, cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn.
19920825000000000	FT  25 AUG 92 / US insurers face heaviest hurricane damage claims. US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk  - known as the retrocession market  - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state. Picture, Page 14

19930326000000000	FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (7): Survival on the seashore - Shiraz Sidhva finds faith and fatalism in the wake of disaster. TWO years after the great cyclone, Ahmed Kabir is still picking up the pieces. The cyclone hit Bangladesh on April 29 and 30, 1991. Ahmed's little mud hut, four miles from the sea, was one of nearly 50,000 homes in this region alone which were washed away. Across the country, 140,000 people were killed and millions made homeless. Ahmed lost more than a dozen close relatives. Apart from losing its home, his family lost all its livestock including four goats and six buffalos. The sea, from where the lethal typhoons swept ashore, is also the source of Ahmed's livelihood - he works on the salt pans and cultivates shrimps. Ahmed and his wife Nafisa Khatun spent the first days after the cyclone at a relief centre 25 miles away in Cox's Bazar. They then went back to their village and rebuilt their home in three months. Ahmed is one of about 10,000 fishermen who catch shrimp larvae, which they sell for Taka10 per 100. Since the fishermen have almost no assets, they cannot borrow from the banks and the cyclone left them in even deeper poverty than before. Sayyat Noor, one of Ahmed's neighbours, says 'the aid agencies helped by giving us money to rebuild our houses and buy fishing nets, but only 10 farmers in 100 were lucky enough to benefit'. Knee-deep in salt in the blazing heat, Sayyat says his family lived for days on the rice, salt and chilli powder that they had kept buried in earthen containers outside their home. These are the 'iron rations' which people in this part of Bangladesh store away in case of natural disasters. 'If we got saved that day, and if we are able to feed ourselves today, it is only because of Allah,' says Noor. About 30,000 families depend on salt reclaiming in Bangladesh and the cyclone destroyed more than 30 per cent of the salt pans and washed away more than 200,000 tons of uncrushed black salt. Two ruined salt works still bear witness to the devastation, although another, less than a mile from the worst hit area, has been rebuilt and is thriving. Large fishing boats are used to transport the salt to Chittagong. The plant's owner, Hafeez, says 1992 was a very good year, thanks to the good weather which enabled the salt panning season to last from November to May instead of the usual mid-December to early April. Abdul Karem, like two thirds of those who work the salt pans, is landless, and has to lease the land on which the salt is deposited. Borrowing from the moneylender who also owns the salt pans, many farmers end up as bonded labourers and their families go ever deeper into debt from one generation to the next. The money lender-landlord also buys back the harvested salt at prices as low as his interest rates are high. 'The cyclone has only increased our debt to the landlords,' says Kasem. 'For those who did not survive, at least the misery of surviving each day has ended.' In summer, the flooded salt flats are used for harvesting shrimps. The methods used to trap shrimp fry are primitive and uneconomical. According to an expert, even semi-intensive methods would yield 1,130kg of shrimps per acre compared with the present 60 kgs. The greater salinity caused by the cyclone and by last year's long dry summer further reduced the shrimp harvest. But nature has not been not entirely cruel to the people of Chakoria. The emerald-green paddy fields that fringe the salt and shrimp flats benefited from the wrath of the cyclone. Nearly 80 per cent of all agricultural crops were destroyed, and the watermelons and tomatos for which the area is renowned were damaged by the increased salinity. But the rice crop was 50 per cent bigger than usual thanks to the rich layers of alluvial soil which the cyclone deposited in the paddy fields. Aid organisations are slowly helping people to rebuild their homes, even though this will seriously deplete the amount of bamboo in the nearby forests. More than 90 per cent of all livestock (1.4m animals in Chakoria alone) were killed, together with all the poultry. Only a few buffalos survived. Thanks to the diligent husbandry of the women, the poultry stock is now back at more than 30 per cent of its original numbers. 'It killed me to save the eggs for hatching when my children were starving,' says Farida Khatun. After the disaster she bought a single hen from the market with money she had saved without telling her husband. She now has 300 birds. 'We have to think ahead, and I knew that a few days more of hunger would afford us comparative comfort later.' For Ahmed Kabir, however, recovery is only relative. 'We were poor to begin with; the cyclone has only made us poorer,' he says. His children had attended one of the 33,000 primary schools destroyed by the cyclone. Today, classes are still held out of doors. Roads have been largely rebuilt and the government is constructing multi-purpose cyclone shelters with financial help from Saudi Arabia. Standing on a rebuilt anti-flood embankment (52 per cent of these structures were destroyed), Ahmed voices the local fatalism. 'No embankment or shelter can save us, if Allah wishes otherwise,' he says. 'Sometimes, when I work to rebuild all I have lost, I can't help wondering how soon it will all be washed away again.'

19930810000000000	FT  10 AUG 93 / High death toll in Caracas storm. VENEZUELAN firemen and civil defence crews were yesterday pulling bodies out of the wreckage of shanty towns ringing Caracas, after tropical storm Bret hit at the weekend. The storm killed about 150 people in the capital, according to reports. Hundreds have been injured and thousands left homeless. Yesterday, residents were clearing up after the rains (picture left). Most of the damage occurred in the Caracas metropolitan area, where heavy rains on Sunday morning battered slum dwellings perched on the city's many hills, causing mudslides and burying people alive. The total number of victims was still in doubt yesterday and the government had not issued official figures. Caracas newspapers estimated fatalities nationwide could exceed 300. The US National Weather Service said yesterday that Bret, which was breaking up as it moved off the Colombian coast, could gain strength before passing over Central America. The government of Venezuelan President Ramon Jose Velasquez of has declared a state of national mourning. Despite a big fiscal deficit, officials are looking for ways to release funds for emergency relief.

19940822000000000	FT  22 AUG 94 / Taiwanese projects in China. Taiwan has approved proposals for 31 investment projects in China totalling Dollars 60m (Pounds 38.9m) and will further relax restrictions on investment by local companies in China, the Economics Ministry said at the weekend. The moves signify a further step in the liberalisation of investment by listed Taiwanese companies across the Taiwan Strait, until recently subject to strict government controls. Small companies have been investing in China since the early 1980s, largely through indirect channels. Taiwan has banned direct trade, investment and transport links with China since 1949, forcing the bulk of such activities to be routed through Hong Kong. The recently approved investments by Taiwanese companies include a Dollars 6m container terminal project by Evergreen Marine, part of the Evergreen, one of the world's biggest container shipping lines. The project marks Evergreen's first foray into China following an announcement in May it planned investments amounting to Dollars 80m. A total of 633 items will be moved from a prohibited list and to a permitted investment list for Taiwanese manufacturers, the Economics Ministry said. The newly approved list includes 196 textile items, 188 machinery items and eight steel-related items. The combined export value of the 633 items was Dollars 22.6bn in 1993, accounting for 27 per cent of Taiwan's total exports, the ministry said. Imports of the items amounted to Dollars 6.14bn or 8 per cent of the total. A fourth typhoon in two months pounded Taiwan yesterday on leaving three people dead and two missing, Reuter adds from Taipei. Typhoon Fred brought 180mm of rain across northern Taiwan overnight and early on Sunday, and as much as 480mm in mountain districts, days after torrential rains from Typhoon Doug caused floods in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Most domestic flights and many trains were cancelled as the storm, with winds of up to 180kph, swept across the north of the island.

19890102000000000	CONSTRUCTIVE DISSENT; A TOPANGA-BASED GROUP IS OPPOSING U.S. POLICY BY HELPING NICARAGUANS WITH BUILDING PROJECTS. Ted Heselton is, in effect, a contra Contra. The 40-year-old West Kennebunkport, Me., carpenter and Vietnam veteran spent 6 weeks in war-torn Nicaragua in 1987 helping build houses, a school and a water system in a poor rural cooperative. "I was frustrated with demonstrations and wanted to do something more personal and practical," said Heselton, a staunch opponent of U.S. support for the anti-Sandinista rebels. "The point is to somehow help the situation rather than having those policies done in my name as a U.S. taxpayer." Heselton is one of 350 volunteers from across the nation who have been recruited and dispatched to Nicaragua's battle-scarred highlands since 1984 by a Topanga-based organization, Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua. These short-term brigadistas have built 85 homes, four schools and four water systems.  Providing Equipment APSNICA, as it is known, has also shipped $170,000 in trucks, generators, chain-saw mills and other equipment to Nicaragua and taught campesinos to use them. It has sent teachers, biochemists and transportation planners to the Central American country for several months each to assist the government. It has arranged trips for Americans to see the revolution firsthand. And, most recently, it is helping rebuild a hurricane-ravaged village. Its slogan defines its mission: "Help Build Not Destroy in Nicaragua." The grass-roots, nonprofit project is run out of an architectural firm, set deep within wooded Topanga Canyon, that specializes in helping the poor and handicapped. APSNICA is one of a handful of groups nationwide -- and the largest in Southern California -- that recruits Americans to support a Sandinista revolution that the Reagan Administration has actively opposed for the past 8 years.  Challenging Policy "Our idea always was that we should bring people down in different capacities so that they can see what was happening there, work with the Nicaraguans, help them, but also come back here and tell others what they've seen so we can change the policy of the Administration," said Stephen Kerpen, 52, the Topanga architect who founded and directs APSNICA. "It's a policy, sad to say, that doesn't respect the sovereignty of Nicaragua, that's contemptuous of Third World people. And it's a policy that kills men, women and children." APSNICA's educational program -- which includes individual slide shows, house parties and a quarterly newsletter -- has reached more than 15,000 individuals in the United States, Kerpen said. Volunteers have also made presentations to civic groups, including several local Rotary clubs. Nationwide, groups such as the Quixote Center in Mount Rainier, Md.; Witness for Peace in Washington, and TecNica in Berkeley have raised $202 million in labor and supplies for Nicaragua since June, 1985, according to Sister Maureen Fiedler, co-director of the Quixote Center. In addition, she said 1,500 Americans are working in Nicaragua at any given time. These efforts seek to counteract U.S. military and humanitarian support for the Contras. In fact, Fiedler said, annual fund-raising goals have been based on the amount of U.S. Contra aid. APSNICA's recruits represent a cross-section of men and women from 15 states. Their ranks have included a cabinetmaker, computer programmer, factory worker, lawyer, park ranger, electrician, waitress, mechanical engineer, university lecturer and music teacher. Some enlist because they want to see firsthand what's happening in Nicaragua, Kerpen said. Others are drawn to a revolution that they say epitomizes a sense of community and idealism that is missing in the United States. Many are driven by opposition to the Administration's Central American policy.  Selective Service Age Heselton, who lives 12 miles from President-elect George Bush's family estate, has another, more personal, incentive to see the Central American hostilities end: His 19-year-old son recently registered with the Selective Service. "I don't want to see him killing Nicaraguans, and I don't want to see him in a war down there," he said. "I don't see anything going on in Central America that's worth Americans dying for." Everyone pays his or her way down, room and board, a $300 administrative fee and insurance costs as well as foregoing potential earnings at home. APSNICA bluntly advises prospective recruits that they are putting themselves "in an inherently risky situation." Participants find various ways to take the time off. Some are self-employed. Those who work in construction may go during the winter lull. Some teachers use their summer vacations. Others take a leave of absence or go between jobs. The U.S. State Department does not have an official policy opposing such groups as APSNICA as long as they comply with U.S. law, said press officer Anita Stockman. Kerpen, however, maintains that APSNICA has been harassed by the government while shipping supplies. And some U.S. elected officials are critical of those who seek to bolster the Managua government.  Sandinistas Criticized "It's hard to object to people building shelter for the citizens of Nicaragua, who are certainly among the oppressed of the earth," said Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), a high-profile Contra supporter. "I do object to strengthening the Sandinista government because I think it's a tyranny." Meanwhile, the Sandinistas -- who work closely with APSNICA -- welcome the volunteers with open arms. "They've been doing a wonderful job there," said Rita Clark, who is assistant to Nicaragua's charge d'affaires in Washington and has visited APSNICA projects. "These are people who saw a need and they started helping. The more they do, the more they want to do." Larry Weiss, 41, a Minneapolis carpenter and self-described anti-imperialist, first went to Nicaragua with APSNICA in early 1987. He returned for almost 8 months later in the year as a project coordinator with his wife and two daughters. He's going back for 6 weeks in March.  'Won't Give Up' Weiss said he was most impressed by the pride and determination of the Nicaraguan peasants. For example, he recalled sitting around a campfire one evening when two older couples discussed the hardships they endured under Gen. Anastasio Somoza, the former U.S.-backed Nicaraguan president who was ousted by the revolution in 1979. "One guy said, 'We'll die before we'll go back to that. We're campesinos. We know hunger. We can do that again. But we won't give up what we have for anything.' " Two events in the past 2 years have spurred APSNICA to expand its activities. The most recent was Hurricane Joan, which killed more than 116 Nicaraguans in October and further wracked an economy already crippled by war. In response, APSNICA established a wood-milling operation in Pearl Lagoon on the Caribbean coast 25 miles north of Bluefields, a town of 42,000 that was largely destroyed. Volunteers are harvesting hurricane-felled trees on the river bank and floating them downriver to the mill, where they will be used to rebuild homes.  Activist's Death The other occurrence was the death of Benjamin E. Linder, 27, a mechanical engineer from Portland, Ore., who suffered a fatal head wound in 1987 when his armed work crew was ambushed by rebels in the northern Nicaragua war zone. Linder was working on a hydroelectric project under the auspices of the Nicaragua Appropriate Technology Project, which he had helped found. "We felt strongly that he was targeted because he was a real figure down there," Kerpen said as he sat at his desk beneath a poster of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. "And we felt it was a means for this Administration to stop other Americans from building in Nicaragua. So instead of stopping us, we made plans to build twice as much." Unlike Linder, who was reportedly carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle for protection, APSNICA volunteers do not bear arms. Instead, they put themselves in the hands of the cooperative defense committees. There have been no APSNICA casualties. The construction efforts are around the town of Mantiguas in the Matagalpa region of north-central Nicaragua, which Kerpen describes as "a war zone but not what you might call a combat zone." Volunteers have heard mortar fire but never been in imminent danger, he said.  Grieving Mother They have encountered grieving Nicaraguans, however. When an APSNICA-sponsored delegation visited a cooperative that had been attacked by Contras, a woman took the group to the grave site of her 16-year-old son who had been killed 5 days earlier, Kerpen recalled. "She said, 'If any of you have cameras, take pictures of all the kids because I don't even have a photograph of my son.' " Still, the volunteers face many hardships. Health problems are endemic. APSNICA warns participants prior to departure that typhoid fever is "not uncommon"; hepatitis is "very common"; malaria is "quite common"; worms, amoebas and other diarrhea-causing parasites are "almost inevitable," and "many Nicaraguan dogs have rabies." Living conditions are primitive. The weather is hot and humid. Food is simple. The workweek entails 45 hours of hard physical labor. Volunteers wash their clothes by hand in the river.  Self-Sufficient "I realized how simple the life is there, how people have learned to live on the basis of their ability to devise tools and hard work," said Lisa Aarli, 29, a Chicago tenant organizer who spent 2 months in Nicaragua in early 1988. "It was one of the most intensive experiences of my life." The experience of working in Nicaragua generally reinforces pre-existing support for the revolution or creates new-found sympathy, Kerpen said. Volunteers Heselton, Weiss and Aarli said this was the case for them. Still, Aarli said: "We were very isolated. We were staying on this cooperative. We didn't get out to see other things. In some ways, I didn't see much in a bigger, broader sense." It was the bigger geopolitical picture that Kerpen says drew him to Nicaragua as a cause. A native New Yorker, he began his architectural activism nearly 25 years ago with urban renewal efforts in Harlem and continued them when he moved to California in the late '60s and directed the Rural Development Corp., which built federally subsidized housing in rural areas.  Unpaid Post In 1971, he established a private architectural firm specializing in low-income housing and barrier-free designs for the disabled with his partner, David Marshall. Peoples Center for Housing Change now provides the headquarters and corporate umbrella for APSNICA; Kerpen is the unsalaried, full-time director, while Marshall handles Peoples Center's paying clients. Kerpen and two others founded APSNICA after a trip to Nicaragua in 1984. The idea arose when a Sandinista official asked them to raise money in the United States for housing in Nicaragua. The first brigade was dispatched in December, 1985, to build 25 simple 3-room, brick-and-stone houses, a 1,200-square-foot school and a water system. "Some people will ask us, 'Well, aren't there communists down there?' " Kerpen said. "The fact is that every country has a right to decide what kind of a government they have. . . . Of course, if anything, it's a nationalist government down there and nothing else. But the question itself is impertinent."
19900425000000000	UPDATE / HURRICANE HUGO; IN CHARLESTON, LIFE'S ALMOST NORMAL AGAIN; BUT SEVEN MONTHS LATER, THE DISASTER LEAVES A NEW LEGACY: A CONTINUING MENACE OF FOREST FIRES.. Seven months later, coastal South Carolina almost looks normal. The tourist season is underway, and Charleston successfully held its annual tour of elegant old homes last week. For this the region is grateful, because time has moved ever so slowly here since Hurricane Hugo roared ashore last September. It is now clear that the storm, which killed 29 people and caused $6 billion in damage in this state, left a legacy that will last for years. Most immediately, residents must contemplate the potential for forest fires along the coast. There, downed trees decay where Hugo left them. The forest fire problem in coastal areas north of here "may well be our greatest danger that we still have to face," Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. told a recent news conference. Around tiny communities like Mt. Pleasant, Tibwin, Awendaw and McClellanville, about 260 million cubic feet of the felled timber has been recovered, but so much remains that it would be almost impossible for firefighting equipment to move through the woods. "What we're looking at in the future are fires that are difficult to control," said Ken Cabe, fire prevention coordinator for the state forestry commission. "It'll be with us for three to five years." In this city and in the outlying areas as well, rebuilding and repairs are still underway. In some communities, neighbors band together to make repairs and collect debris. Charleston officials have high hopes for the tourist season. "Unless you've been here enough to know which tree was where, you may not notice the destruction," said Barbara Vaughn, public information coordinator for the city. Indeed, the city is no longer the prostrated habitat left behind by the 140-m.p.h. winds that roared directly up Charleston harbor. At the same time, troubles remain. The convention and visitors bureau itself lost a roof during the storm, and now is run out of two trailers. The building will not be ready for occupancy until the end of May. Homeowners say they still have a hard time getting work done, and even when they do, they run into problems with preservation officials who demand that replacement materials meet difficult standards. Mary Brown, a retired teacher who is chronically ill, lost a roof off her two-story home near downtown. After months of waiting and hassling with insurance officials and contractors, she recently got a new one but was told it did not conform to preservation rules. To avoid having to rip off the new roof, Brown said: "I got to do some tough talking and some praying, too." As repairs are made, another huge problem is created: trash. Mounds of it sit in front of some homes here, and it litters the countryside. State officials said enough garbage has been removed after Hugo to fill 620,000 trucks. This, of course, drastically shortens the life of garbage dumps, exacerbating an already serious problem. Some trash burning has created smoke hazards severe enough to endanger auto traffic, say officials. In seaside communities along Hugo's path, many homeowners are rebuilding their damaged beachfront homes, to the chagrin of environmentalists who saw Hugo as a kind of opportunity to stop development that has eroded land and polluted water. "What kind of idiots would want to rebuild their houses at the same place?" demands Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University coastal geologist who warns against building too close to the sea. "They're foolhardy in the extreme."
19900625000000000	TYPHOON LASHES PALAU, HEADS FOR PHILIPPINES. Typhoon Percy battered the Pacific island of Palau and then roared west Sunday toward the Philippines, where at least 30 people were killed in a tropical storm last week. One child was killed on Palau, a newspaper said.
19890628000000000	THE NATION. Remnants of Tropical Storm Allison moved into eastern Texas and western Louisiana, still dumping heavy rain and triggering thunderstorms after hitting the Houston area with more than 10 inches of rain. Downpours flooded homes and streets, forcing at least 800 people into Red Cross shelters. At least two fatalities were blamed on the storm, which was downgraded to a tropical depression in the morning. Harris County Sheriff's Department divers pulled a man's body from rain-swollen Spring Creek. On Monday, a traffic death in the Beaumont area was attributed to the storm. In southwestern Louisiana, police reported that a tornado at Hackberry damaged roofs and destroyed a mobile home.
19890629000000000	STORM FLOODS HUNDREDS OF HOMES IN LOUISIANA. The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison flooded hundreds of homes Wednesday in southern Louisiana and whipped up tornado-force winds that injured five people in Mississippi. Almost 10 inches of rain fell in the Baton Rouge area and 3 to 6 inches more were expected. Allison came ashore Monday in Texas and was blamed for four deaths in that state. More than a foot of rain fell in some spots, and authorities estimated that damage could total $1 billion in the Houston area alone. Louisiana and Mississippi continued to take a pounding from the storm as Texas began drying out.
19890705000000000	CAMPERS, SOME IN KAYAKS, FLEE FLASH FLOODING. Flash floods forced hundreds of Fourth of July campers out of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, and some had to be ferried across swollen streams by kayak after more than a week of heavy rain across the South. Hundreds more were still out of their homes elsewhere because of flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison. The death toll since Allison sloshed ashore in Texas a week ago rose to 13 -- one in North Carolina, five in Mississippi, four in Texas and three in Louisiana. At least 700 Louisiana homes have been flooded, and about 500 people remained flooded out of their homes in Liberty County, Tex., authorities said. Campers were evacuated from three steeply mountainous counties of western North Carolina. One woman drowned when her tent was washed away, but her husband was rescued. Divers searched for her body and those of possible other victims. Several agencies and volunteers used kayaks to take campers across rapidly rising streams. The remnants of Allison had brought more than 1.5 inches of rain to the mountains since Monday, causing some mudslides. The National Weather Service said up to 4 inches of rain were likely in some areas.

19900826000000000	13 KILLED, 200,000 FLEE HOMES AS STORM LASHES AT PHILIPPINES. At least 13 people died and 200,000 fled to safer ground during floods and heavy rains spawned by a tropical storm in the capital and surrounding provinces, officials said Saturday. Manila Weather Bureau officials said the storm late Saturday was located 345 miles east of Aparri on the northern tip of the main Luzon island, with peak winds of 40 m.p.h. The military Office of Civil Defense said 13 people were killed by flooding in the capital, either by drowning or being pinned by a wall that collapsed at the height of the rains. The Social Welfare Department said more than 200,000 people in the capital and in the rice-producing provinces of Tarlac and Bulacan, north of Manila, sought refuge in evacuation centers. Most of the evacuees were from metropolitan Manila slum districts, relief agency officials said. Weather forecasters said the storm unleashed heavy rains that combined with high tide in the afternoon to create one of the worst floods in recent years. Thousands of commuters were stranded and hundreds of workers and students slept in their offices and schools as transport drivers refused to ply flooded streets. Also Saturday, suspected rebel soldiers seeking to overthrow President Corazon Aquino exploded a bomb at a Toyota sales office in the capital's financial district, damaging six cars but causing no injuries, police said. The blast was the 11th in the capital since rebel soldiers announced Aug. 15 that they would resume hostilities after Aquino rejected their call for a cease-fire in the face of the devastating July 16 earthquake and the Persian Gulf crisis.
19900830000000000	TYPHOON TOLL AT 216. The death toll from Typhoon Yancy, which lashed China's southern coast last week, has climbed to 216, the China Daily News reported Wednesday.
19890911000000000	THE NATION. Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic whipped up huge waves, sweeping beach goers out to sea and capsizing boats from Maine to New York. But by late in the day, Gabrielle's winds had weakened to 65 m.p.h. and it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Gabrielle was located 350 miles south-southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Hurricane Center in Florida said. Earlier, at least six people were reported missing and three people apparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the sea swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high, even on some rivers. "People shouldn't be out there," said Jarred Randall, a Narragansett, R.I., police sergeant who rescued two teen-agers from the water.
19890917000000000	48 DIE, 190 INJURED AS TYPHOON STRIKES CHINA; FARMLAND FLOODED. Typhoon Vera killed 48 people, injured 190 and left 26 missing when it struck the East China province of Zhejiang, the New China News Agency said today. It said the typhoon, the worst to hit the province in 27 years, flooded the port of Shujiang, closed down a major power plant and inundated 195,200 acres of rice fields and orange groves Friday and Saturday in the area south of Shanghai. Torrential rain caused many rivers and ponds to breach their banks and many rivers to exceed danger levels, the agency added, but it gave no more details.

19890920000000000	HURRICANE NEWS; FAMILIES RELY ON RADIO TIES TO CARIBBEAN. Thousands of Southland residents were besieging local ham radio operators Tuesday for word of relatives and friends on Caribbean islands who may have been in the path of Hurricane Hugo. But with requests for emergency disaster assistance taking priority in ham communications to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, most of those concerned are not likely to get their messages answered for several more days, according to amateur radio instructor Gordon West of Costa Mesa. But West said "no news is good news" in this situation, because if the relatives had been seriously hurt or killed, that information would be passed along quickly. As of Tuesday, 25 storm-related deaths had been reported in the eastern Caribbean, including two in Puerto Rico. That is little comfort to Cynthia Harper Miley. The Newport Beach woman has tried frantically to get word of her sister and brother-in-law, who were marooned on the tiny island of Culebra off the east coast of Puerto Rico when Hugo, packing 125-m.p.h. winds, struck Monday. With power and telephone communications knocked out in the Caribbean, Miley, 37, asked a ham operator late Monday to try to track down her sister, Joan Foley, 45, and Foley's husband, Ed Burnsed, 48, on Culebra, where the two had been stranded since Saturday for emergency boat repairs. The word Miley got back Tuesday was not reassuring: Culebra's harbor, where Foley and Burnsed were towed after the engine of their boat stalled, was a scene of devastation, a ham operator told her. But no word has trickled out on casualties there. "I've cried all night," Miley said Tuesday, who is maintaining a vigil beside her telephone. "If we (her family) can at least hear there are not any casualties, and everybody is safe on the island, then we'll be fine. But now, I'm on pins and needles." West, who helps mobilize the county's 5,000 amateur ham enthusiasts in such disasters, said his network received about 1,000 calls in one three-hour period early Tuesday from county residents seeking information on loved ones caught by the hurricane. "I received 25 messages" in 45 minutes, West said. Such calls as Miley's are forwarded by West and the other ham volunteers to the National Amateur Traffic Network, which is relying upon East Coast ham operators to forward messages to hams in Puerto Rico, West said. The messages for information are given secondary priority to information on the devastated area, the hardest-hit communities and the need for medical aid and supplies, he said. After those messages are relayed, the radio operators in Puerto Rico will be asked to check on such people as Foley and her husband. West hopes that all of the responses come back as Message 1, which is the radio operators' code for: "Everybody safe here. Please don't worry." Less reassuring, however, is Message 26, which means: "Immediate help for sick and injured in evacuation needed at once." Any death announcements, West added, would be handled by the State Department or through other radio channels. Joe Gallant, 67, a ham from Newport Beach who has been monitoring his radio for nearly three days straight during Hugo's march, said information on casualties was still being tallied Tuesday. Gallant said radio frequencies have been filled, instead, with reports of damage. "It's just a disaster," Gallant said Tuesday as his radio crackled in the background. It was Gallant who radioed Miley's request for information. Gallant said the response he received from the disaster region indicated that Culebra, about 40 miles from Puerto Rico, had been pummeled. "The harbor was devastated, and all the boats are devastated," he said. Miley said her sister and husband -- retired and living on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in their 40-foot yacht Hiatus -- had gone into Puerto Rico last week to refurbish the vessel and were on their way home when the engine failed. The vessel was towed to nearby Culebra, where Foley and Burnsed were last reported awaiting repairs Saturday. Miley's sister, Beth Andrini, 40, of Costa Mesa, is also waiting anxiously for news, as is the rest of the family in Jacksonville, Fla. Another status request had been filed with local ham operators Tuesday by Lynne Weintraub, 43, a housewife from Orange whose friend, Joe Linares, along with his family, were caught in the storm. Linares lives near San Juan with his wife, four children and 82-year-old mother. But unlike Miley, Weintraub heard back Tuesday that the Linares family is safe. Linares, 52, managed to call his sister -- Estelle Nash, 55, of Riverside -- from a business telephone that had been restored to service. HURRICANE TOLL RISES At least 25 die as storm aims at U.S. Part I, Page 1
19890920000000000	EAST COAST BATTENS DOWN AS HURRICANE HUGO NEARS. Residents from Florida to North Carolina stocked up on groceries, flashlights and window-reinforcing tape for Hurricane Hugo's expected assault, and the Navy sent ships to sea today to ride out the killer storm. Looting broke out on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the wake of the storm blamed for at least 25 deaths in the Caribbean. President Bush declared the islands a disaster area, and the government made available $500,000 for food and emergency supplies there. Forecasters said the chances of the hurricane hitting the East Coast late this week were steadily increasing, and most projected paths had the storm hitting between Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Cape Hatteras, N.C., by early Saturday.  High Winds, Rain The storm today brushed northeast of the Bahamas with winds of 105 m.p.h. and was expected to bring mostly high wind and rain. Workers boarded up government buildings, and Prime Minister Lynden Pindling cut short a visit to Jamaica. Hugo's center was located this afternoon 360 miles east of Nassau in the Bahamas. It was moving northwest at 12 m.p.h., a course it was expected to maintain through today. "Looking at satellite pictures, the eye of the storm is coming back stronger," meteorologist Jim Gross said. "There might be some slight intensification. We don't expect it'll reach 140 m.p.h., as it was when it hit the Virgin Islands." The Navy today began to send ships to sea from a base at Charleston, S.C., to avoid storm damage. Looters ransacked stores and law enforcement collapsed on St. Croix, where tourists pleaded with reporters for help in getting out.  'Help Us!' "When we landed, we were pounced upon by about 15 tourists," said Gary Williams, a reporter for a San Juan newspaper. "They said, 'Please get food! Please get water! Please help us! They're looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen National Guard looting. There's no law and order here.' " Hugo so far has left millions of dollars in damage, more than 50,000 Caribbean residents homeless and hundreds injured. In Georgia, residents stocked up on batteries, food, plywood and generators. Insurance companies told agents to hold up writing some types of policies until the storm passed. Boaters were advised to move inland. Sheriff Van Findley in Effingham County, Ga., said he was rounding up generators for emergency medical headquarters and shelters and arranging for chainsaws for use in cutting trees that may block evacuation routes. "I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork and beans," said Bryan Raleigh, manager of a grocery in the Wilmington, N.C., area. "It's been pretty steady all morning."
19900923000000000	VIETNAM STORM TOLL 10. Tropical Storm Ed tore through central Vietnam with torrential rains last week, killing at least 10 people and leaving thousands homeless.
19891003000000000	RAIN, FLOODS, TORNADO ADD TO HURRICANE WOE. Rain, floods and a tornado heaped more misery on Hugo-wrecked South Carolina on Monday, interrupting rebuilding efforts from the hurricane that pummeled the coast 12 days ago. Relief officials deluged with clothing urged donors to send building supplies, food and cash. "I feel sorry for the people. It's terrible. It adds insult to injury," National Weather Service meteorologist Dick Shenot said after 2.5 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period on Charleston, the town hardest hit by the hurricane's 135-m.p.h. winds. A tornado in Lebanon, about 25 miles north of Charleston, left two injured. About 100 people in Anderson County, 200 miles north, had to be evacuated because of flooding. The Broad and Blair rivers in Gaffney, the Congaree River in St. Matthews, the Waccamaw River in Conway and the Saluda River in Chappells spilled over their banks Monday. The Tiger River rose 12 feet above flood stage, damaging a major telephone cable and knocking out long-distance service from Spartanburg to Asheville, N.C., said Ron Laughlin, spokesman for AT&T. He had no estimate of the number of people affected. In North Carolina, also deluged by rain Monday and still recovering from Hugo, Monroe rescuers were looking for three people missing when a creek flooded and swept away their car. A fourth passenger was rescued after clinging to a downed tree for more than an hour. Aid from across the nation continued to pour into South Carolina. The response has been so overwhelming, though, that some officials do not know what to do with everything. "We have clothing backed up on us, including in boxcars that have come from the West Coast," Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation Army said. "People, generally speaking, only want a number of clothes . . . and we've reached that certain amount. We're backlogged."  10 Rooms Full of Clothes In the fishing village of McClellanville, population 500, about 10 classrooms in the local school are filled "from floor to ceiling with used clothing." "Used clothing has almost choked us to death," said Billy Newsom of the American Red Cross. Bush and Newsom said donations of non-perishable food items are still desperately needed. As cleanup efforts progress, hardware items will be in demand to help repair homes and businesses, Bush said. Marilyn Quayle, Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, visited the hardest-hit areas of South Carolina and worked briefly at a relief center Monday in Moncks Corner. She was expected to work in Charleston before leaving the state today. Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135-m.p.h. winds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless and 270,000 jobless.
19901005000000000	WORLD; KLAUS GAINS POWER IN CARIBBEAN. Tropical Storm Klaus gained strength off Antigua today and was upgraded to a hurricane after leaving six people dead and two missing in flooding on the Caribbean island of Martinique. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus had sustained winds of 80 m.p.h. this morning, up from 60 m.p.h. earlier. It remained stalled 30 miles off Antigua but was expected to start moving again. It was uncertain whether Klaus, the sixth named hurricane of the season, would reach the United States. "We expect it in the next two or three days to move toward the northwest and to be north of Puerto Rico and east of the Bahamas. Beyond that, it's too early to say," the Hurricane Center said.
19891008000000000	THE WORLD; TYPHOON HITS PHILIPPINES. Typhoon Angela roared through the northern part of the main island of Luzon in the Philippines, killing at least 26 people and leaving another 40 missing, relief officials said. The storm, with winds over 100 m.p.h., caused heavy damage to structures and crops, with about 8,500 people being forced from their homes. The 26 who were killed drowned when floodwaters swept through their homes in the coastal town of Gonzaga, 270 miles north of Manila. Detailed damage and casualty reports from remote areas may take days or weeks to reach Manila, the capital, because of ruptured communications.
19891012000000000	WORLD IN BRIEF; PHILIPPINES; NEW STORM BATTERS REGION; 31 KILLED. Tropical Storm Dan pounded Manila and nearby Philippine provinces, killing 31 people and raising to 149 the death toll in two storms that struck the country in less than a week, news reports and officials said. Carrying peak winds of 60 m.p.h., the storm roared across provinces on the southern portion of the main Luzon island from the Pacific Ocean and swiped Manila as it swirled out into the South China Sea.
19901013000000000	SOUTH AWASH IN PINCERS OF DUAL STORMS. Hurricane Lili and the remains of Tropical Storm Marco locked pincers on the South on Friday with a combination of powerful winds, heavy surf and drenching rains. At least 10 people have died in the storms. Lili lurked off the shore of North Carolina, a weakling among hurricanes, spinning harmless 8-foot waves into the Outer Banks. Its winds were clocked at 75 m.p.h. -- barely over the hurricane threshold of 74 m.p.h. But the convergence of the hurricane and the tropical storm, plus the dying remnants of Tropical Storm Klaus, brought a third day of rain and dangerous flooding to parts of the coastal Southeast. "We got so much rain, so fast. . . . We've never had anything like this," said Pam Smith, director of the Richmond County Emergency Management Agency in Augusta, Ga., whose west side was swamped by floodwaters. In South Carolina, where floods Thursday carried coffins out of a graveyard, state climatologist John Purvis said some places had the most rainfall in a century. At the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., forecasters said Lili appeared to be veering to the north sooner than expected, decreasing the threat of a direct hit on the mid-Atlantic Coast. The hurricane's center was about 290 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. It was moving northwest at nearly 15 m.p.h. "It poses less threat to the East Coast now," said Herb White of the National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C. "Now it's projected to parallel the coast a little farther out." Forecasters said gale-force winds could extend 75 miles inland along the route of the storm. Tourists in North Carolina packed ferries to flee the Outer Banks, although the most noticeable signs of the storm were waves big enough to thrill surfers. The real danger for the time being lay farther south, in Georgia, where four people drowned in rising floodwaters that ravaged the Augusta area. The floods were blamed on remnants of Tropical Storm Marco, which blew north Thursday out of the Gulf of Mexico. Three people drowned Thursday in South Carolina, and one person drowned and two died in storm-related accidents in North Carolina. In Augusta and surrounding Richmond County, officials closed all roads and declared a state of emergency, Smith said. "All of our roads are flooded," she said. "People are trapped in their homes. People are hollering out for help through their windows. Some are on the rooftops. There are people in their cars floating down the road." Emergency officials began evacuating families in the Augusta area Friday morning.
19901014000000000	STORM LOSES HURRICANE STATUS; MORE FLOODING IN EAST. Tropical Storm Lili veered away from the mid-Atlantic coast Saturday, its hurricane status a memory, but the remnants of two other storms created floodwaters from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania before disintegrating. The National Weather Service reported that Lili, which had once carried 92 m.p.h. wind gusts, dropped to tropical storm status Saturday as it began turning toward the north. A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the extreme southern coast of Virginia, with a tropical storm watch over the remainder of the Virginia coast. A tropical storm watch, with a coastal flood watch and heavy surf advisory, also was posted for the Delaware and Maryland coasts. As of Saturday afternoon, the storm was about 175 miles east of Cape Hatteras, N. C., and was moving north at about 14 m.p.h. Its peak winds of 65 m.p.h. extended up to 115 miles eastward, but it was expected to turn northeast and pick up speed as peak winds diminished. Weather officials said small craft from Hatteras to Eastport, Me., should remain in port. The strong winds combined with glass-smooth waters to produce ideal conditions for windsurfers who flocked to Pamlico Sound, which lies between North Carolina's Outer Banks and the mainland. Rain from two tropical storms that weakened and fell apart after hitting land caused some problems Saturday along the East Coast, where nine people were killed earlier in the week. A major flood was working its way down the Ogeechee River in east-central Georgia, the weather service reported. The level of the upper Ogeechee River was six feet above flood stage, the highest level since the 1940s. Heavy rains caused flooding over portions of northwest Virginia, western Maryland and eastern West Virginia. Many rivers and streams were overflowing their banks, and numerous roads were closed. A small-stream flood watch remained over northeast Pennsylvania, and flood watches also were posted over portions of New York state and northern Vermont. The remains of Tropical Storm Marco -- which earlier absorbed remnants of Tropical Storm Klaus -- were moving northward through the Carolinas, but the weather service said it had broken into a multitude of minor storms and was no longer trackable. In the Carolinas, six deaths were attributed to the storms. Two were traffic fatalities and four were the result of a collapsed dam, officials said. Georgia authorities reported three deaths from flooding near Augusta. Elsewhere Saturday, it was windy in the West with winds gusting to 57 m.p.h. near Pocatello, Ida., and 58 m.p.h. at Laramie, Wyo. Snow fell in the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming, and the town of Spruce Lodge reported two inches of new snow. It was 84 degrees in Cape Hatteras, breaking the record high of 83 degrees set in 1986. It was the seventh record high tied or broken during the past week.

19901113000000000	TYPHOON ROCKS PHILIPPINES; AT LEAST 14 KILLED. The strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines in nine years swept across the central islands today with 150 m.p.h. winds, killing at least 14 people, sinking ships and forcing 240,000 people to flee their homes. The navy said a merchant ship with 25 crew members was missing off Mindanao island and that 16 boats had sunk off Cebu island. Three sailors were reported missing in the Cebu sinkings. At least 17 people, including six Americans, were trapped on an oil rig off Palawan island after 68 other workers were evacuated, said Maj. Antonio Babijes, chief of the Manila Rescue Coordinating Center. He said officials asked U.S. Air Force and Navy authorities to assist in evacuating the rig after a rescue boat was forced back by rough seas. The rig is operated by Alcorn Production-Philippines Inc. After wreaking considerable destruction in the midsection of the nation of islands, the so-called "super typhoon" passed into the South China Sea in the evening, sparing populous metropolitan Manila and U.S. military bases in the northern Philippines its fury. The storm smashed into Leyte from the Pacific Ocean with sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. The typhoon then raked rice, coconut and sugar farms in Cebu, Negros, Panay and Palawan islands. Its winds weakened to 100 m.p.h. before it moved out into the South China Sea. Relief agencies said two people were killed in Panay island, seven in Negros and five in Leyte. Most of the fatalities either drowned or were hit by flying debris. Officials said downed communications and power networks prevented a full assessment of damage and casualties, and they feared the death toll would go up.
19891204000000000	ST. CROIX SEEKS TO REBUILD BATTERED IMAGE; VIRGIN ISLANDS: THE DEVASTATION FROM HURRICANE HUGO REMAINS. MANY RESIDENTS WANT THE AREA TO BE KNOWN AGAIN AS AN 'AMERICAN PARADISE.'. Two months after Hurricane Hugo ripped through St. Croix with winds in excess of 150 miles an hour, 80% of the island remains without electricity and telephones, thousands are living in severely damaged homes under roofs fashioned from plastic sheets, and the winter tourist season has been written off completely. But, say many residents, even tougher than rebuilding homes and lives in this devastated U.S. territory is rebuilding the island's image as an "American paradise." Hugo not only physically tore apart this 82-square-mile island, it also stripped bare its deep-seated social and racial problems. The storm roared in after dark on Sept. 17, bringing wall-to-wall destruction. Trees were uprooted, tin roofs went flying, boats were piled atop each other on shore and glass was shattered everywhere. For the next two days looting was rampant. The storm severed all communications with the outside world, and with no lights and little evidence of local law enforcement on the streets, an unnerving air of anarchy descended, residents say. As newspapers and television spread images of people carting off appliances and men armed with shotguns patrolling a shopping center from the roof, President Bush ordered 1,100 Army troops to the island. Order was restored quickly. But the damage, both to the public image of the island as a haven for tourists, and to the private image residents had of themselves, had been done. "It just shocked me," said Everett Gumbs, a 63-year-old taxi driver. "My wife and I saw four men carrying a refrigerator down the street, and I said: 'What is this? Something's wrong.' " "There was racial tension here prior to Hugo (related to) an expanding gap of economic difference," says Jerry Garcia, 26-year-old executive director of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce and a native of the island. "So the good thing the hurricane brought about is an awareness. The issue is now being discussed." The issue of race is a particularly sensitive one on this island, still haunted by the grisly murder 17 years ago of eight people at the Fountain Valley Golf Course. Five black men were charged with killing the eight, seven of whom were white. Mike Hernandez, a conciliation specialist with the U.S. Justice Department's Community Relations Service, helped investigate the Fountain Valley case. "People here are still traumatized by Fountain Valley. You hear about it all the time," he says. Now Hernandez has been sent back to St. Croix to reactivate a human rights commission that has lain dormant for years. "St. Croix is not a powder keg," he says. "We're not going to see a riot here. But St. Croix -- like other U.S. cities -- needs some sort of mediating organization to deal with tensions." What's wrong in St. Croix may be no different than what's wrong in many other scenic Caribbean islands, where the development of tourism seems to have favored off-islanders with money more than the native population. Although 85% of the island's 56,000 residents are black, most of the businesses are owned by whites and other non-blacks. David M. Nissman, the U.S. attorney in St. Croix, says that despite the multi-ethnic population, "color matters less here than anywhere I've ever lived." But, he adds, "internal weaknesses in the Virgin Islands government and a school system that is a mess" have put native Crucians at a competitive disadvantage for jobs. "And that's a cause of tension," he said. In the aftermath of the storm, that tension bubbled to the surface, Nissman says. Although initial reports of attacks on whites by machete-wielding gangs were patently untrue, "there was some violent crime, and some racial epithets were directed at continentals," as whites are called here, Nissman says. "And let's not sweep this under the rug for the sake of tourism." Tourism is two-thirds of the economy in the Virgin Islands -- St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix -- which became an unincorporated American territory in 1917 when the United States bought the islands from Denmark for $25 million. Last year, almost 2 million tourists visited -- most via one of the many cruise ships that stop at St. Thomas -- and spent $676 million. Visitors spent $132.8 million last year on St. Croix. Positioned as they are atop the Lesser Antilles chain, just east of Puerto Rico and about 1,100 miles southeast of Miami, the islands are on the main line for hurricanes that form off the coast of Africa and head west across the open Atlantic. But Hugo was the first tropical cyclone to hit the Virgin Islands directly in 61 years. Both St. Thomas and St. John suffered considerable damage. But St. Croix got plastered. Today, the island looks like it's waking up from a hangover, still a little groggy, but determined to set itself right. The roads are clear, the trees are greening with new leaves and debris is being hauled to dump sites by the truckload. But evidence of Hugo's fury is never far from view nor out of mind. An island-wide curfew remains in effect from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., and although the Army troops have gone, local police and National Guard forces have been bolstered by the arrival of 150 MPs from a Washington, D.C., National Guard unit. After its roof fell in, the island's lone hospital was condemned. Medical care is now dispensed by doctors and nurses working in tents set up in the parking lot. "We've cut down on elective surgery," administrator Lloyd K. Austin said. "We're just doing things that have to be done." In Fredericksted, the island's second city, the pier that once enabled huge cruise ships to tie up and disgorge tourists was blown away, and without visitors the town looks depressed. In the mountains that run through the center of the island, the once stately mahogany trees are splintered and cracked, as though blitzed by a firestorm. Hundreds of houses along the rugged coastline remain roofless or collapsed into rubble. Still, in the major city of Christiansted, amid the noise of hammers, saws and portable generators that have replaced the chatter of tourists on the narrow streets, there is optimism. Sailboats remain beached on some downtown streets, and the harbor is littered with overturned hulls, but there is a lot of hard work going on. About 750 of the island's 1,700 hotel rooms are habitable, and all are filled, with off-island construction workers, Red Cross and federal disaster teams, insurance adjusters and 450 linemen sent from power companies in six states. There are not many tourists here, and no one is expecting them back soon. The Virgin Islands government recently spent $600,000 to promote the winter season, which begins Dec. 15, and did not even mention St. Croix. "We're not ready for tourists yet," says Charlie Martin, executive director of the St. Croix Hotel Assn. While food supplies are ample, businesses are reopening daily, and school has started up again, coping with the day-to-day routine can be a struggle. "There is a lot of stress here," says Jerry M. Kaiser, an expert on stress management flown in from Santa Cruz, Calif., to conduct workshops for schoolteachers and students. For many, daily life means filing insurance claims, applying for Small Business Administration loans or filling out forms at offices set up by the Red Cross or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "In 16 years with FEMA, I've never seen a place hit so hard border to border," said Steven B. Singer, director of the agency's efforts here. Although only five persons were reported killed as a result of Hugo, Singer said most of the homes on the island were damaged or destroyed, and more than 95% of the power poles were blown down. Most residents will not have full electrical and phone service until spring. Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly estimated total damages to the territory at $935 million. On St. Croix, Singer says FEMA has passed out $125 million in goods and materials, including 4.2 million pounds of food, and more remains to be done. "FEMA will have a presence here for two years," he added. Physical recovery seems certain. Hotels will reopen. Sid Kalmans, the owner of the Caravelle Hotel, hired 11 construction workers from the mainland, put them up in the 11 of the hotel's 43 rooms that still have roofs and set them to work. He plans to welcome guests again by the summer. But Kalmans knows that island residents have some emotional repair work to do as well. For two days after the storm, Kalmans walked the street in front of his hotel with a rifle in his hands. The weapon was unloaded, he now admits. But seeing shops all around him being looted, he said he was determined to protect his property. By the second day after Hugo's passage, the looters represented a broad cross section of St. Croix society, attested to by later arrests. Among those charged with grand larceny were former Virgin Islands Sen. Adelbert Bryan, a captain in the local police force and an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate, alleged to have stolen a truckload of building material; and Michael Harris, the owner of a popular Christiansted cafe, who allegedly stole foodstuffs from a competitor's shop to resell in his own. Many residents are convinced that St. Croix will emerge stronger for the tribulations Hugo has posed. Kalmans said he thinks "those few days after the storm, when things were crazy, brought people together. We started a community watch program to look out for each other."
