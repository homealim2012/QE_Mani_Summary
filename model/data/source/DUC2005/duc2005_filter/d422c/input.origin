19910415000000000	FT  15 APR 91 / Thieves dump 20 Van Goghs. TWO armed thieves stole 20 paintings by Vincent Van Gogh from Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum yesterday but abandoned their haul - worth more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 112.9m) - less than an hour later near a city railway station. Police said they had no idea why the two masked thieves had decided to abandon the paintings and their getaway car after managing to pull off the biggest art theft in the Netherlands since the Second World War. The 20 paintings, which were worth at least Dollars 10m each, included such works as The Potato Eaters, Self-portrait As Painter, and Still Life With Sunflowers. The museum houses the world's single biggest collection of paintings by Van Gogh, whose work soared in value on the art market in the 1980s. Police said they had no trace of the masked thieves, who were described only as two men who spoke English with American accents. One of the thieves may have hidden in the museum just before closing time on Saturday afternoon, according to police. Around 3am, he overpowered two security guards and forced them to turn off the alarms. He then let the second man into the building. About 45 minutes later, the thieves fled after forcing one of the guards to hand over the keys to his car, a Volkswagen Passat. Shortly thereafter, the car and the paintings were found near the Amstel train station just outside the city centre. Three of the 20 paintings were seriously damaged but they will be restored, Mr Ronald de Leeuw, the director of the museum, said. A police spokesman said: 'The robbery seemed to be well thought out but the ending was amateurish.' The spectacular robbery is the fourth theft of Van Gogh paintings in The Netherlands in the past three years. It also comes just a year after the museum marked the 100th anniversary of Van Gogh's death with a major exhibition of 135 paintings, including many on loan for four months from foreign museums and collectors. The insurance cover for the borrowed works totalled Dollars 3.2bn. The paintings which were stolen and then recovered yesterday were uninsured, in line with Dutch government policy of not insuring works of art in order to free up funds for other spending on the arts.

19920919000000000	FT  19 SEP 92 / Hi-tech sleuths who take art off the fence: Harriet Crawley visits the Belgravia bunker from which Brigadier Emson traces stolen art. BRIGADIER James Emson has been a trouble shooter all his life. When London's firemen went on strike he was appointed Chief of Staff for Military Firefighters. Today he is leading another fight, against art theft. The weapons are not hosepipes or guns but computers, and some slick software produced in the US and installed in the basement of 13 Grosvenor Place, a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace. From his high tech bunker, surrounded by five university graduates with degrees in history of art, the ex-Brigadier directs his fast-growing operation. The International Art Loss Register is a computerised database of stolen art with over 40,000 items in its memory bank ranging from snuff bottles to marble Venuses. Items (they must be over Pounds 1,000 in value) are logged by description and by photograph on the state-of-the-art optical computer. The fees vary. Insurance companies take out a corporate subscription for Pounds 8,000-odd pounds, which means that whenever one of their clients is robbed the theft is automatically logged with the ALR; otherwise you and I pay Pounds 20 to register a theft, or Pounds 10 to conduct a 'search,' which says Emson, has no cut off point. The ALR was founded in 1990 by a consortium of leading auction houses (Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips) and insurance companies (Hogg Group, Lloyd's, Nordstern). It has confounded its critics and is proving extraordinarily successful in tracking down stolen art. Recently, a man in a double breasted suit appeared at the counter of Sotheby's with a view of Westminster Abbey by John Inigo Richards, claiming he had bought it in a car boot sale for Pounds 40 and had cleaned it with Fairy Liquid. Sotheby's found the story far-fetched and rang the Register. There, Caroline Wakeford fed details into the Register, to instigate a 'fuzzy' search, hoping for a 'match.' Up came an identical picture logged as stolen a month earlier. A cry of jubilation went up in the bunker. The police are making increasing use of the Register. The police have free access to the ALR, and many of the 'dedicated' officers spend hours in the bunker 'fuzzy searching'. Recently the Regional Crime squad paid a visit with photographs of two stolen pictures, Charles I and Henrietta Maria, copies of Van Dyke, which had been registered in 1991 by a loss adjustor. This led to the recovery not only of the paintings but of nine other items, all stolen from the same Somerset house. 'Liaison between the 52 different forces in Britain is poor,' said Sarah Jackson, another articulate ALR sleuth. 'Increasingly we act as go-between.' The Metropolitan Police logged the theft of several pictures from a private London house with the ALR; six weeks later the City of London police found a hoard of paintings in Jewry Street and, suspecting they must be stolen, came to the register offices with photographs. After feverish 'fuzzy searching' the paintings were identified as the same sea scapes by James Cleveley the Elder and works by Thomas Luny, worth Pounds 60,000, which had been stolen from a private house in Westminster and registered by the Met. At the end of July, the Register identified a stolen item of furniture when it was sold at an auction. This gave police the breakthrough which led them to a series of 'fences' in London. They recovered 3,800 items stolen in burglaries in the the southern half of England. The Register identified 198 of the items, 80 of which were insured with Lloyd's. The new head of the Metropolitan Art and Antiques Squad, Detective Chief Inspector John Butler, is so impressed with the Register that he is installing a modem in Scotland Yard to give the police instant access to the files. Emson is delighted: 'The police don't have a comparable stolen art register which includes images, so we are filling a vacuum. We are the art equivalent of the Lloyd's register for shipping.' Sotheby's and Christie's, leading shareholders of the ALR, use it to have their catalogues searched at a cost of over Pounds 20.000 a year. 'If we can show a painting has been stolen they will withdraw it at once . . . both Sotheby's and Christie's are determined to see a reduction in the traffic in stolen art.' Insurance companies have a vested interest in subscribing to the ALR (corporate subscriptions run at Pounds 8,500 a year.) They want to get the stolen art back so that they do not have to pay out. 'At last we're getting through to the loss adjustors,' says Emson. 'They are beginning to see that it is worthwhile registering thefts with us.' The figures speak for themselves: 134 Lloyd's syndicates subscribe and over Pounds 400,000 of stolen art has been recovered. Syndicate 33 paid the ALR a fee of Pounds 2,179.60 and recovered Pounds 67,350 of art. 'Value for money,' the ex-Brigadier purred. But the art trade is showing little interest in the Register, even though the Society of London Art Dealers and the British Association of Art Dealers are both shareholders. Phillip Broadbridge of the London and Provincial Art Dealers Association says his members are sceptical of a commercial body which is doing the police's job for them. Emson counters: 'The police are unlikely to get a national database of stolen art . . . anyway even if they do it won't be available to the public. A dealer can subscribe for only Pounds 36 a year . . . it must be in everyone's interest to stop the circulation of stolen goods.' And yet dealers are not coming forward. 'It's the hassle . . . police, perhaps a court appearance, a lot of wasted time . . .' says Phillip Saunders of Trace magazine, which circulates photographs of stolen art. 'In my view dealers will never subscribe in any numbers . . . they should but they won't' In France dealers are obliged by law to register all purchases except those bought at public auction. 'This draconian measure has been an effective deterrent against dealers who may otherwise have been tempted to buy stolen art,' said Saunders. 'It's only a matter of time before the same legislation comes to Britain.' Meanwhile, the ALR is spreading its international net: the European dealers' associations have subscribed, so have leading French, Swiss, German and US insurance companies. A few weeks ago the head of the Italian national art squad, Colonel Conforte, visited the Belgravia bunker. Soon the ALR will be working round the clock. It is linking its computer with Centrox, a US company which digests the catalogues from 178 auction houses round the world. The ALR will be able to search for your Georgian tea pot, Constable sketch or Chippendale chair, world wide. Unless the art thieves think up a computer virus to stop it.
19930306000000000	FT  06 MAR 93 / Stolen portraits are recovered. TWO portraits, one by Reynolds, the other by Gainsborough, which had been stolen from the Great Hall at Lincoln's Inn in London in 1990, were recovered this week when they were brought into Sotheby's for evaluation. They had been bought at the Bermondsey market in London for Pounds 145 for the two, and the new owner, who had no idea of their provenance, carried the two canvases to the auction house in a plastic bin liner. Ms Lucy Hodson, of Sotheby's British pictures department, was called down to the front desk to examine the paintings and immediately recognised them as the work of Reynolds and Gainsborough. She checked with the Art Loss Register and discovered they were the missing paintings. 'I could not believe my eyes when this man pulled these two paintings from the bin bag,' she said. 'Both of them had been taken from their frames when they were stolen and the Gainsborough was rolled up. The Reynolds is smaller and was still on its stretcher but I recognised them straight away.' A portrait of William Pitt the Younger by Gainsborough, which was also stolen in the raid, has yet to be recovered.

19890214000000000	THE NATION. A retired Argentine police commissioner and his wife were held in Miami on charges of conspiring to sell stolen paintings worth as much as $100 million by such masters as El Greco and Goya, FBI officials said. Juan Carlos Longo, 53, and his wife, Hilda, 40, who have homes in Buenos Aires and Miami, were held without bond in pretrial detention after being arrested last week, the FBI said. During the investigation, Longo told an informant, posing as a dealer of stolen artworks, that 11 paintings stolen from Argentine museums were split between two groups in Argentina, according to an FBI affidavit. The Longos were arrested Feb. 6 after the informant set up the purchase of "Doves and Hens," a masterpiece by Goya, allegedly stolen from the Castagnino Museum of Rosario, Argentina, on March 24, 1987, the FBI said.
19900320000000000	COLUMN ONE; ONE CRIME THAT'S A FINE ART; PRECIOUS ARTWORKS ARE SECOND ONLY TO NARCOTICS AS A LURE FOR GLOBAL CRIMINALS. SOARING PRICES, AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THIEVES, ARE FUELING THE BOOM.. The wood-paneled offices are tucked away on the fourth floor of the Explorers Club in Manhattan -- a nice bit of symbolism -- and serve as a central clearing house in the international search for stolen art. When the phone rang on Monday, it was no surprise that the FBI was on the other end of the line. The agent in the Boston field office wanted to know if the International Foundation for Art Research could print a special bulletin with pictures and descriptions of a dozen priceless masterpieces taken from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston Sunday -- the biggest theft of old masters in the nation's history. "The FBI and the Gardner Museum want to get the word out," said Constance Lowenthal, the foundation's executive director, who immediately began planing a mini-magazine which will be sent to collectors, art dealers, museums, insurance companies and law enforcement agencies around the world. "They (the robbers) obviously stole it very well," Lowenthal said. "The next part is more difficult to carry off. It requires a different set of skills to insert these works of art into the art market." Her colleague, Margaret I. O'Brien, speculated that the works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet and Vermeer could well prove impossible to dispose of because of all the publicity. But they could also be held for ransom, or possibly dealt to a collector intent on having a masterpiece no matter what the origin. Art experts said Monday that the astounding haul from the Gardner -- possibly the biggest art theft in modern times -- underscores what law enforcement officials have realized for more than a decade: stealing art works has become the second biggest international criminal activity after narcotics. The boom in stolen art is fueled partly by soaring prices, increasing sophistication of thieves and the low priority many thefts get from law enforcement agencies busy focusing on violent crime. Lowenthal's group maintains files on more than 30,000 stolen art cases. More than $100-million worth of paintings, sculpture, decorative arts and antiquities are stolen each year on average around the world. A single case like the Gardner theft can balloon that number dramatically. Although the museum will not put a price on the missing masterpieces, some experts say the value could be a quarter-billion dollars. And while the masterpieces may prove to be challenging to unload, lesser artworks are almost liquid assets in today's art underworld. Experts estimate that only 5% to 10% of stolen artworks ever finds its way back to the owners. "You'd be amazed at how many folks are dealing unknowingly with stolen art," said Milton Esterow, editor and publisher of ARTnews magazine. "More and more of the thieves know exactly what they are doing. They know the difference between a Rembrandt and a Botticelli," he said. "As thieves have become more knowledgeable about the art world, more sophisticated, law enforcement activities in the United States have diminished, and that's disgraceful," Esterow added, noting that offenders, when apprehended, often receive light sentences. "Thefts have gone up for two reasons," Lowenthal said. "The value of what is stolen has risen so dramatically. Thieves who used to steal other things have learned there is value in art and antiquities. They are willing in some cases to accept 1% of market value when they sell stolen goods. They sell to unscrupulous dealers who don't ask any questions." In the case of the Gardner thefts, "It's difficult to figure out what the thieves will do with the art if you think of it in the normal manner of buying and selling," said Detective William Martin, a Los Angeles Police Department art theft expert who has worked in the field since 1980. "If I were investigating this case, I'd be looking at ransoms and rewards," he said. The Boston thieves might demand a ransom from the museum or an insurance company, he said. If a reward is offered, an accomplice "might just happen to be walking down an alley and spot one of the paintings in a trash can," Martin said. One case involving a ransom occurred last year, when thieves stole three paintings by Vincent van Gogh from the Kroeller-Moeller Museum in Otterlo, Holland. They demanded a $2.2-million-ransom and returned one of the works. The others were later recovered and four suspects arrested. It is unlikely the Boston thieves are working for a collector, Martin said. "Everyone wants to hear that thieves steal to order for some mad collector who will hide the art in a castle . . . (but) the joy of collecting is showing your collection. Theft is done for profit. The basic motivation is money," Martin said. Still, occasionally thefts are commissioned for works that cannot be legitimately acquired. One such theft occurred in 1983, when thieves stole Italian Renaissance masterpieces, including Raphael's self-portrait, from the Hungarian national museum in Budapest. Investigators found that a sophisticated band of Italian art thieves, armed with cutting tools and high-tech alarm-busting devices, executed a perfect break-in and vanished with the works. An extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home country before they could get the paintings to Greece where, it was later found, an olive oil baron had paid a handsome sum for the sake of having the works hang in his home. "There aren't many thieves with that sort of expertise," said Robert Volpe, a former New York City police detective who worked on the Hungarian case and is now a private consultant tracing stolen art around the world. "They were capable of stealing anything." Recoveries are relatively rare but when they occur, they are celebrated in "IFAR Reports," the monthly publication of Lowenthal's group. The magazine listed 10 important recoveries in 1989 in its December issue. Among them is "one of 21 Dutch Old Masters stolen at gunpoint in a daylight raid on a Zurich gallery, and allegedly transported to the U.S. in a diplomatic pouch." The painting by Dutch master Adrian van Coorte was recovered through the efforts of New York dealer Richard Schillay, who was offered some of the works, according to the journal. A lithograph, "Sick Child," by Norwegian Expressionist Edvard Munch was returned to an Oslo collector after a citizen's tip about a suspicious driver led Norwegian police to a cache of stolen art. Auguste Rodin's bronze "Mask of a Man With a Broken Nose," stolen from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, turned up under a sewer pipe in the basement of a Philadelphia truck driver, thanks to an anonymous tip. Christie's auction house was responsible for another recovery, listed in the publication. A double-sided drawing by Rembrandt "induced gasps of excitement" when it was delivered to the auction house for consignment, but it was later found to be property stolen in 1979 from the Rembrandt House Amsterdam, the IFAR publication reported. Documentation is essential to recovering a stolen work of art. When law enforcement officers receive vague descriptions of stolen property, such as "oil painting, multi-colored" or "painting, abstract," as is typical of thefts from private collections, they can't help. But when photographs and complete documentation of stolen artworks are available, as it is for works in major museum collections, the information can be circulated and the items can be easily identified if they are found. The Gardner thefts prove that American museums have a serious security problem, but they are better prepared than European institutions, which are often housed in antiquated, ill-equipped buildings. Of all the art-rich countries, Italy probably has the greatest difficulty protecting its treasures, some of which still sit around in open churches, Martin said. "There has been an increase in museum thefts in America during the last two years, principally back east," Martin said, noting that "there hasn't been a major museum theft in Los Angeles for a long, long time." Martin credits that record to effective preventive measures. "The security in major museums in Los Angeles is excellent," he said. Art museums have become more security conscious and installed increasingly sophisticated security systems during the last decade, he said. Effective security for a museum includes a "very sophisticated, up-to-date alarm system, 24-hour protection by trained security officers and back-up cataloguing of items in the collection," Martin said. Given that effort, the Gardner theft sent shock waves through the museum world. "I'm just devastated. It's a terrible loss," said Deborah Gribbon, associate director for curatorial affairs at the J. Paul Getty Museum. "People may get the impression that the Gardner is a lax institution or that it is understaffed, but that's not true. It's not a situation where they were a sitting duck," said Gribbon, who was curator of the Gardner from 1976 to 1984. The Getty, the Los Angeles area's most conspicuous center of art wealth, has always been security-conscious, Gribbon said. "But there's no question that you take a look at what you are doing after something like this," she added. "The Gardner theft underlines that excellent security people are the ultimate line of defense, and ours are extremely good." "Certainly an incident like this causes all museums to reflect on and review their procedures." said Jeanne Collins, director of public information at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Museums typically do not insure artworks for full replacement value. Rates are prohibitive and the money is better spent on prevention, museum officials and insurance agents agree. While museums have the most valuable collections and are vulnerable to the largest losses, dealers whose doors are open to the public are probably even more susceptible. Longtime dealers say that security is a relatively recent worry, but an extremely serious one now. "We didn't have any security at all when I started out here about 55 years ago; it wouldn't have occurred to anybody to take a work of art," said Klaus Perls, owner of Perls Galleries on Madison Avenue in New York. "It was very hard to get rid of art in any way you wanted to -- you couldn't sell it and there were very few people who wanted it. In the museums, there were some precautions but they were more about fire than stealing." Perls was a victim of theft in January, when a mobile by Alexander Calder was stolen through a domed skylight. "You would not believe the kind of fortifications we have in our place now," he said. Dealers who exhibit at antique shows across the country deliver objects to armories or halls where the exhibitions are held using unmarked vans or trucks. "All drive trucks with nothing on the side panels," said Wendell Garrett, editor of the magazine Antiques. "Anonymity is the best thing." It is also the first line of defense for many private collectors. Being identified as the owner of a major artwork once was regarded as a status symbol, but "you go to exhibits nowadays, and most labels say 'loaned by a private collector' rather than identifying the owner," said Jim Reinish, senior vice president of New York's Hirschel Adler Galleries. Experts say that while spectacular robberies like that at the Gardner Museum may make headlines, smaller thefts are more common. Each year, the International Foundation for Art Research adds over 2,000 works of stolen art to its files. They include liturgical objects like a 19th-Century silver chalice stolen in Seraing, Belgium; a 16th-Century Gothic clock taken in Zurich; an Egyptian statue of a standing man stolen in New York, and a 20th-Century Tiffany Studios peony lamp taken last June in Beverly Hills. The foundation put out a special art theft alert offering a $100,000 reward for a private collection of 60 pieces of art, antiquities and Oriental and tribal sculpture stolen last March in New York City. It included a Picasso pastel and pencil drawing and an Egyptian Middle Kingdom standing man. Goldman reported from New York and Muchnic from Los Angeles. Staff writer Karen Tumulty and researcher Lisa Phillips in New York also contributed to this story.

19900425000000000	LANCASTER MAN PLEADS NO CONTEST TO PAINTING THEFT. A Lancaster man who admitted stealing an $18,000 painting from an Antelope Valley College exhibit pleaded no contest Tuesday to a charge of grand theft. Jerald Christopher Sharitz, 23, entered the plea in San Fernando Superior Court after prosecutors agreed not to seek a jail sentence of more than one year, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald L. Smalstig said. Sharitz could have been sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison, Smalstig said. Also on Tuesday, Sharitz's roommate, Timothy Daniel Cain, 27, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of being an accessory to a felony. Cain confessed to stealing the painting when Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators inspected the men's Lancaster apartment in November. But Sharitz surrendered to authorities shortly afterward and said it was he, not Cain, who stole the artwork. Smalstig said Cain's admission was made to protect Sharitz. Deputies searched the apartment after an acquaintance of the pair told officials that he had seen the painting in their apartment and recognized it from news reports. Sharitz lifted the 17th-Century Dutch painting by Gerard Hoet the Elder, titled "Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape," from a gallery wall on Nov. 6, authorities said. Smalstig said Sharitz, a student at the college, had become enamored of the painting while conducting an inventory of artworks in the exhibit. "He said he stole it for inspiration," Smalstig said. Sharitz and Cain, who are free on their own recognizance, are scheduled to be sentenced May 29.

19900626000000000	SHORT TAKES; STOLEN MADONNA RECOVERED. ithograph by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, stolen from an Oslo art gallery in April, has been recovered, news reports said today. The print, Madonna, worth about $231,000, was among four works by Norwegian artists recovered at a house in Drammen, near Oslo, newspapers said. All the works had been stolen. Two Norwegian men were held on charges of receiving stolen property, but they were not suspected of stealing the artworks, reported the Norwegian news agency NTB. The Madonna was among a number of works stolen from the Kunsthuset gallery in mid-April.
19900709000000000	THE MICHELANGELO OF SECURITY. For more than 25 years Joseph Chapman has made his living, in part, by breaking into museums. "I walked through the museum like I was a visitor and then at the end of the day I went into a men's room stall and hid there," said Chapman, 60, a ruggedly built man who speaks about art with reverence. The story he was telling took place in 1965 at the Amon Carter Museum in Ft. Worth, Tex. "At 5 o'clock I heard the toggle switches go and everything got dark and quiet," he said. "And the museum was all mine." Chapman was not there to take anything. Rather, he was intent on leaving something behind -- his business card. Chapman, a former FBI agent, is founder of one of the best known museum security companies in the world. He and his team of architects and engineers have designed security systems for the National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Archives, the Forbidden Museum in Beijing, the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities in Cairo, the National Palace Museum in Taiwan, some of the Smithsonian museums and the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Locally, he has done work for the the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Norton Simon Museum and the Gene Autry Museum, for which his team designed a high-tech system so pervasive that it makes use of cameras hidden inside the heads of manikins, microwave motion detectors hidden in the walls and tiny electronic sensors attached to every object on display. In the last week-and-a-half, the number of calls coming into his Connecticut-based firm has increased at least 50%, Chapman said. The reasons are easy to trace. On June 28, three Van Gogh paintings were stolen from the North Brabant Museum, 55 miles south of Amsterdam, and last Wednesday three paintings were taken from three museums in Paris, including a Renoir that was sliced from its frame in the Louvre. "We've been getting calls from museums I have never heard of," Chapman said, adding that they had a similar flurry of calls in March after the theft of $200 million worth of paintings and drawings from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. "There is nothing like a terrible robbery to call attention to the woeful security situation in some museums." Indeed, Chapman leaves today for the Netherlands -- officials of the North Brabant Museum are bringing him in to visit their institution and discuss what a new security system would entail. He has not been contacted by the Louvre. "French museum officials don't much like to call on outsiders," said Chapman, who has been a frequent visitor to that museum. Asked to hazard an assessment of the Louvre's security arrangements, he said he has noticed that the security guards are not aggressively diligent. "Unfortunately, at the Louvre the security guards are almost all, by requirement, disabled war veterans," Chapman said. "The problem is that they have not had a war recently from which to draw worthwhile people." Chapman began dealing with art thefts in 1958 when J. Edgar Hoover appointed him as the first FBI agent to exclusively investigate these types of crimes. He made several famous art recoveries while with the bureau, including Picassos stolen from a Pittsburgh industrialist (Chapman was made up to look like the industrialist to deal with a thief who demanded ransom) and a group of Paul Cezanne drawings stolen in France. In 1964, Chapman left the bureau to be a consultant to Lloyd's of London, the New York attorney general and an art heist movie entitled "How to Steal a Million." He set up his own security firm in New York, and one of the first calls came from an old friend, the director of the Carter Museum in Ft. Worth. "He told me, 'We have a good security system but I would like to have an outside evaluation. Why don't you drop in some time? You don't even have to tell me you are coming.' " Chapman, who believes in the element of surprise, left on a flight that same morning to Ft. Worth. Being careful not to be seen by the museum director, he toured the Carter and then hid. He was a "stay behind," in the jargon of the art-theft world. He wandered the museum halls unchallenged, placing his card behind several pictures. He also got into the director's office to leave another card and a note giving the telephone number of his hotel across the street. When he left through a door, he purposely tripped a photoelectric beam alarm and then went up to his room to observe the police response. "The director called me the next morning," he said. After muttering an epithet in greeting, the director demanded that Chapman "come over here and have lunch." Chapman eventually designed a new security system for the museum, one that has at least so far guarded it from "stay behinds" or any other kind of theft. Chapman has, however, suffered losses from museums with which he has worked. The worst came just before Christmas, 1978, when a call came from the Chicago Institute of Art, for which he had designed a security system. Three Cezanne paintings, worth more than $3 million, were missing. He caught a flight to Chicago, not to return home for several months. Chapman gives credit to the Chicago police for eventually solving the crime, which centered on "the most dangerous piece of paper in the museum environment, the temporary removal notice," he said. Everyone who frequents museums is familiar with those small notices that mark the spots where art has been removed for photography, a loan, repair or some other reason. The man who was eventually convicted of the crime, Laud Spencer Pace, worked as an art handler in the museum and figured out that if he took a painting off a wall and replaced it with an official-looking notice, the robbery would not be discovered for at least several days. This gave him ample time to take each painting out of its frame and wear it home under his winter coat. "When they arrested him," Chapman said, "they found over 2,000 blank notices in his apartment." Chapman now asks all his museums to keep careful control of the temporary notices, and he trains security personal to regularly read them. Another important safeguard against inside jobs, Chapman said, are thorough, centralized inventory records. At some major museums individual curators still keep their own records, which can lead to easy theft. If a stored object is taken and the record of it destroyed, it can be difficult to trace. Computerized inventories provide better security but can also be the source of unpleasant surprises. A computerized inventory check last year resulted in the discovery that more than 100 objects, worth more than $2 million, were missing from the collection of American Indian art at the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles. Officials at that museum still refuse to call it a theft, even though the FBI has been investigating and has reportedly recovered some of the objects from dealers and collectors far from Los Angeles. Officials at the Southwest Museum would not discuss details of their security system but said it had been upgraded since the objects were discovered missing. At some museums, a thorough inventory is simply not practical. "In 1976, the word came down that we had to put a real emphasis on inventory and collections management," said Warren Danzenbaker, who at the time was in charge of security for the Museum of American History, one of the Smithsonian museums in Washington. "Of course, we only had about 15 million objects to worry about," he said with a laugh, "of which about 12 million were stamps." Because the Smithsonian has periodic inventories, strict policies on the movement of art objects and a pervasive electronic security system, said Danzenbaker, who is now chief of security systems for all the Smithsonians, the museums have not suffered a serious loss due to theft since 1981 when someone made off with a set of George Washington's false teeth. The electronic wizardry of the modern security world is markedly out of place with the bucolic surroundings at Chapman's home and offices in suburban Connecticut. A cobblestone walk leads to the simple white house where Chapman and his artist wife, Else, live. There are gardens, stone walls, wind chimes and lawn benches. Nearby is a converted barn that looks homey from the outside, but inside are immaculate workplaces and offices for the 14 full-time employees of his company, a drafting room and a library. Also inside are stored the security plans for some of the world's most famous museums. Doesn't it make Chapman nervous to have those plans -- which are printed on the premises because Chapman doesn't trust them to outsiders -- out here in the country? He shakes his head no and points to various wooden boxes attached to the house and barn. "That one is a passive infrared energy type," he said, pointing to a box painted to fit the color scheme of the barn. "There is another one behind the rain gutter and another behind the wind chimes." All, he explained are connected to a master control in the house that is monitored 24 hours a day. Not even his employees -- all of whom go through extensive background checks before being hired -- have access to complete plans. Several of them might work on a museum, but in the company only Chapman, his wife and Robert Ducibella, an engineer who recently became his partner, ever see a museum's complete security scheme. The company is currently working on new projects being designed by prominent architects such as Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry and Peter Eisenman. They have several Southern California projects in the design stage, including at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles and museums in Newport Beach, Santa Ana and La Jolla. Chapman and his crew are also under contract to periodically run a security check on museums for which they previously designed a system. This includes an occasional staged stay behind -- they enter the museum unannounced and try to find a place to hide. "We fit ourselves into a closet or some place where we might not be discovered, and then wait and see if the system works," he said. "Usually," he said with a smile, "we get caught."
19900717000000000	ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS. For those who prefer to skip the museum and go directly to the gift shop: New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art is opening a retail outlet in the Century City Shopping Center this fall. In addition to posters and stationery, reproductions of sculptures from the Met's massive collection will be offered for purchase. Also available will be museum memberships -- for the old-fashioned folks who would rather gawk at the originals on 5th Avenue than spend all their time and money at the West Coast, Westside retail emporium. Switching from Manhattan to Manhattan Beach, but keeping with the subject of art: Those city-installed dumbbell sculptures that were heisted from a seaside bench last month still have not been recovered. "It would be a surprise if they did turn up," acknowledged Howard Spector, the community's public arts administrator. "There was no reward put up this time." "DDumbbell," consisting of two cast bronze 25-pound hand weights, was first stolen hours after being bolted down by city workers last September. The art piece was recovered that time with the help of a $500 reward. Police were on the lookout for any suspicious-looking hulks, possibly with hernias. Add serial criminals: the mad manhole-cover lifter is still on the loose. City sanitation officials report that 185 of the iron covers now have disappeared in little more than a week in locations ranging from Hollywood to South-Central Los Angeles. With the total replacement cost exceeding $15,000, authorities are beseeching the public for help. "If you see someone lifting a manhole cover, especially the ones in the sidewalk near the corner catch basins, please report the event," says Sanitation Bureau Director Delwin A. Biagi. Authorities surmise that the thief has been getting away in a vehicle. Each cover weighs 40 pounds. Police were on the lookout for any suspicious-looking hulks, possibly with hernias. America's most wanted: Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who has shunned the spotlight since his defeat in the June Democratic primary for state attorney general, also skipped the National District Attorney's Assn. conference in Kalispell, Mont., this past weekend. The session was held at a rural resort called, of all things, the Outlaw Inn. Need a lift? Today marks the start of "Things Are Looking Up Week" in Los Angeles, in conjunction with the 1990 International Jugglers Assn. convention at UCLA. More than 1,000 prestidigitators are expected to be on hand for a slew of juggling-while-running races, consecutive-toss contests and an all-star comedy-juggling show. Police were expected to be in the audience, on the lookout for anyone juggling manhole covers. Do city sign makers have trouble with heights?

19890913000000000	STOLEN SCULPTURE CAPER FUELS A BATTLE OVER ART; MANHATTAN BEACH EMBROILED IN ANOTHER CONTROVERSY OVER CITY-SPONSORED PROJECT. It's not every city that boasts a civic organization called the Friends of the Arts. Then again, it's not every city that seems to have as many enemies of the arts as Manhattan Beach. Only hours after being bolted onto a seaside bench, a city-installed artwork entitled "Ddumbbell"was stolen over the Labor Day weekend. The cast bronze sculpture, in the shape of two slightly abstract hand weights, was recovered last week after the Friends of the Arts posted a "no questions asked" $500 reward. The "Ddumbbell" caper was not the first art imbroglio in the increasingly posh beachside community. Manhattan Beach drew headlines seven years ago when police officials objected to an abstract metal sculpture the city had placed in front of police headquarters. It seemed that the men in blue were averse to the piece's pastel color scheme and wanted it repainted, or removed. Before the yearlong controversy concluded, two then-City Councilmen, under cover of the night, spray painted the sculpture black and white in what they termed a joke. Meanwhile, some opposition appears to be surfacing against the city's new public arts program, which, besides "Ddumbbell," includes the temporary installation of a serpent's head (some say it resembles a shower head) on a concrete wall near the beach and four steel posts (some say they resemble outdoor lighting fixtures) across town in Polliwog Park. In a poll conducted by a local weekly, The Beach Reporter, several respondents suggested that the city could make better use of its $20,500 municipal art budget by cleaning the city's streets or fixing up the municipal pier. "What good is art if we have dog poop on the sidewalks?" one reader wrote. Scribed another: "I don't get it. . . . Why bother with ugly, pointless art? . . . We can go to a museum free of charge. . . . A classic pier will be in style forever." C. R. (Bob) Holmes, a 10-year City Council veteran, believes public support for municipal art "is pretty darn close to a 50-50 thing." "Probably about half the people think that -- in an affluent, financially secure community like this -- government expenditures at a reasonable level on the arts aren't inappropriate," he said. "And I'd guess that probably about half the people feel that government expenditures on art aren't appropriate." Local arts activists say community concern over the theft of "Ddumbbell" has spotlighted the heightening interest in public art in a town where three-piece-suited Yuppies are rapidly replacing wet-suited surfers. Rather than anxiously waiting for city government to get involved, the 200-member Manhattan Beach Friends of the Arts, formed early this year, responded immediately with the $500 reward. As soon as the reward notice was posted, activists said, dozens of calls of support flowed in.  Unusual Occurrence "Something bad happened, but people in the community took it upon themselves to knock on doors and distribute handbills. That's something we don't see very often," said Robert Millar, a member of the city's Cultural Arts Commission. "We were thrilled with the community response," said Sandy Wetmore, spokeswoman for the Friends of the Arts. "We're finding a lot more friends than enemies. . . . People are interested in the arts as a quality-of-life issue in a community like Manhattan Beach." One of the callers was Chris Davis, 25, who said he had noticed one of the dumbbells under the stairway of an apartment building in a nearby alley. Davis, with a portable phone, returned to the site, keeping Wetmore apprised. "She was saying like if the police come by, could you tell them where it is," Davis, an employee of McNall Sports and Entertainment, explained later. " . . . The weird thing was I had (also) seen the dumbbell when it was over on the bench and I thought, someone left their dumbbells there."  To Buy Surfboard Davis said he will use the reward money to buy a new surfboard. At this point, police say, there are no known suspects in the theft. And reaction to "Ddumbbell" itself remains mixed. While some residents interviewed found the piece humorous, others complained that it placed more emphasis on physique than on the oceanside environment -- albeit at a beach where some lithe sun worshipers are known to wear swim suits little larger than the washing instructions on an average dress shirt. Even the harshest critics, however, said that "Ddumbbell" should be returned to its home of less than a day on The Strand at 20th Street.  Stronger Bolts And Santa Monica artist Anne Preston, who designed "Ddumbbell," said she plans to reinstall it soon. But this time, she said, she will use stronger bolts and will ask Manhattan Beach officials to place a plaque nearby informing the public that the object, insured for $3,500, is indeed a piece of art. "They will have to, because it sort of looks like an abandoned object otherwise," Preston said. "It has a very tactile nature to it. It's instinct for people to want to touch it."
19900924000000000	WORLD IN BRIEF; FRANCE; POLICE RECOVER 5 STOLEN MASTERPIECES. French police recovered five masterpieces stolen from Paris museums last summer, including a small work by Renoir. Police arrested Richard Etoh-Mvondo, 21, and said he confessed to stealing the paintings and a small 15th-Century statue. They said he also had stolen a 1470 portrait by Italian painter Lazzaro Bastiani from a Venice museum last week. He led police to Lyon, where the works were recovered, including Renoir's "Portrait of a Seated Woman" cut from its frame at the Louvre on July 4 during visiting hours.
19900928000000000	SOVIETS INTERCEPT 22 STOLEN PAINTINGS. Soviet customs authorities said Thursday that they have seized 22 paintings, some stolen from Leningrad's Hermitage gallery, and other cultural objects as they were being spirited away to West Germany. The haul, valued at about $1.8 million, was seized Wednesday by officials in the Baltic republic of Lithuania. Tass news agency said the haul was being moved by an employee of a joint venture who was heading for West Germany. It did not give the nationality of the employee.
19891003000000000	WORLD; 2 SENTENCED IN THEFT OF 3 VAN GOGHS. Two Dutchmen were each jailed for five years today for stealing three paintings by Vincent van Gogh last year in the Netherlands' biggest art theft. A Dutch court convicted Anton Willem Baeten, 37, and Anton Overweel, 30, for stealing the paintings worth up to $100 million from the Kroeller-Mueller Museum and demanding a ransom for their return. One of the stolen paintings, "Weaver's Loom and Weaver," was recovered last April when the thieves left it in a car trunk and said they would destroy the other two unless they received $2.2 million. The other two paintings, "Wilted Sunflowers," and "The Potato Eaters," were recovered in July after the men's arrest.
19891014000000000	STOLEN RENOIR FOUND. A tiny painting by French Impressionist Pierre Auguste Renoir, stolen from its frame in a Brussels art museum last week, was found in a ventilation duct in a museum washroom, an official said Friday. The painting, entitled "Nude," is worth about $50,000.
19901105000000000	SHORT TAKES; STOLEN ARTWORK FOUND, MAN HELD. A $320,000 French painting snatched from a gallery wall was recovered in a New York apartment, police said Sunday. A 46-year-old man was arrested and charged with burglary. The canvas by Maurice Utrillo was one of several paintings -- together estimated to be worth up to $1 million -- found at the apartment in Brooklyn, said Sgt. Norris Holloman, a police spokesman. Police didn't know if the others had also been stolen. Balazs Gabor was arrested and charged with burglary and possession of stolen property. The Utrillo painting, "Rue a Montmartre," a 1926 work showing a Paris street, was stolen last Tuesday from the Soufer Gallery in Manhattan.

Stolen Warhol Works Recovered: Amsterdam police said Wednesday that they have recovered stolen lithographs by the late U.S. pop artist Andy Warhol worth more than $1 million. The 81 works were stolen from a West German gallery near Bonn last September. Police arrested a 35-year-old Dutch dealer and two buyers Tuesday night after a tip-off that the dealer was selling some of the works in a local hotel. They recovered 14 lithographs. The other 67 Warhols were found in a house search. Police arrested two Britons and two Yugoslavs, seizing firearms and a large amount of cash. ALEENE MacMINN
19891130000000000	AUTHORITIES GET 2 CONFLICTING CONFESSIONS TO PAINTING'S THEFT. Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators believe they have one confession too many in the theft of a 17th-Century Dutch painting recovered at the apartment of two Lancaster men who were arrested for stealing the $18,000 artwork. The roommates, one of whom is an art student at Antelope Valley College where the painting was stolen Nov. 6, have both confessed to taking the painting off the wall of the college art gallery and walking out with it, Detective J. Siebert said Wednesday. But Siebert believes only one person stole "Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape," painted by Gerard Hoet the Elder before 1700. Each suspect says the other is innocent, Siebert said. "They're probably trying to protect each other," he said. "Both say they don't want the other one to get in trouble for something he didn't do. I believe one is the thief and the other is an accessory." Jereld Sharitz, 23, a student at the college, and Timothy Cain, a 27-year-old grocery clerk, were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of grand theft. Cain was arrested at their apartment in the 43300 block of Gadsen Avenue in Lancaster and Sharitz surrendered shortly afterward at the sheriff's station, the detective said. Siebert said he has been notified by the owner's lawyer that the work, which was recovered in good condition, is worth about $18,000 -- considerably lower than the tentative estimate of $50,000 to $100,000 made by college officials. Deputies served a search warrant Tuesday afternoon after an acquaintance of the suspects told Siebert he had seen the painting in their apartment and recognized it from news reports. Sharitz was released on $1,500 bail, and Cain remained in custody Wednesday in lieu of the same bail amount, Siebert said. The theft last month abruptly ended the college's first major art show "Great European Masterpieces," an exhibit featuring 18 paintings owned by Lancaster businessman Kenneth McDonald. The show was monitored by a student aide and occasionally by security guards. The gallery alarm functions only when the building is closed for the night. Sharitz told investigators he took the painting because he liked it and because it was nearest to the gallery entrance, Siebert said. Cain, meanwhile, said he stole the painting as a gift for Sharitz, Siebert said. Gallery director Pat Hinds described Sharitz as a student with a "healthy interest in art. I was surprised. He's a very nice person." Sharitz has been taking courses at the college since 1983, college officials said. This semester he is enrolled in a ceramics class taught in a room next to the gallery, they said.
19891201000000000	METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT SEIZED IN 1978 THEFT OF ORIENTAL ART. A man suspected of stealing a million-dollar collection of hundreds of ancient Nepalese and Tibetan art objects in New York 11 years ago was arrested Thursday at his South Los Angeles home, where he had been hiding the antiquities, police said. Craig Warner, 40, was arrested at his home on suspicion of receiving and transporting stolen property and was being held on $5,000 bail, said Detective William Martin, the Police Department's art crimes specialist. The collection is made up of hundreds of Tibetan and Nepalese statues and art objects, many dating to the 8th Century. The antiquities, many of them depictions of Oriental gods, were stolen Christmas Day, 1978, from the Manhattan home of antiquities collector Jane Werner, Martin said. Martin said the suspect and Werner were acquaintances in New York and that Warner had been an original suspect in the case.
19901206000000000	STOLEN MONET, 8 OTHER WORKS ARE RECOVERED. Clues from Japan led police to a stolen masterpiece by Claude Monet that gave its name to Impressionism, a French police chief said today. Monet's "Impression Sunrise" and eight other Impressionist works were taken from a Paris museum five years ago. All nine were recovered from a villa on the French island of Corsica on Wednesday. Mireille Ballestrazzi, head of France's art theft police squad, said more than 12 suspects were being held. One was handed over to a judge, who will decide whether to press charges. It was not clear whether those arrested included the hooded bandits who raided the Marmottan Museum in broad daylight. Ballestrazzi said she found the first clues three years ago during an investigation in Japan, where experts feared the works could have been sold. "We got some testimonies that led us to Corsica step by step," she said in a television interview. Apart from Monet's 1872 masterpiece -- a misty dawn in Normandy that gave its name to the Impressionist movement -- the nine recovered paintings included two by Auguste Renoir. Two were slightly damaged.
19901220000000000	FRENCH MASTERPIECES FOUND IN BERLIN MUSEUM; ART: THE 28 PAINTINGS SEIZED BY NAZIS HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN AN ARMOIRE SINCE 1972, A MAGAZINE SAYS.. Twenty-eight French masterpieces seized by the Nazis during World War II, including paintings by Monet, Renoir and Gauguin, have been found in a cupboard at a Berlin museum, a news magazine reported today. This week's cover story in L'Express described how the works seized from private citizens between 1942 and 1944 have been locked away since 1972, their existence known to only a handful of people. According to the magazine, the Department of French National Museums learned that the works existed in 1975 but "was not interested because the works did not come from national collections." "Never did the prestigious department think of consulting its experts or glancing through the catalogues of the artists in question," l'Express wrote. The paintings included Claude Monet's "Route, Effet d'Hiver. Soleil Couchant (Road, Effect. Sunset)"; Eugene Delacroix's "Jeune Homme (Young Man)"; Auguste Renoir's "Coco Ecrivant (Coco Writing)"; and Paul Gauguin's "La Falaise (The Cliff)." They were examined by l'Express reporters, who said they were in excellent condition. Sylvie Poujade, a French museum spokeswoman, said her department learned of the paintings' existence a month ago when contacted by l'Express reporters. "We searched our archives and did not find proof that the department had ever received a list of works from Berlin," Poujade said. Poujade said French museums are considered "depositories of state property which they are expected to conserve and display in good condition." "Our role is not to track down or recuperate artworks not considered state property. That's the job of other government offices," she said. The magazine quoted Lothar Brauner, curator at the Nationalgalerie, in formerly East Berlin, as saying he received the works on May 19, 1972, from an unidentified person claiming to have gotten them from a third party. A legal document drawn up that day shows that the person wished to hand over the paintings "so that they would be properly preserved until being returned to their rightful owners." Brauner said he did not know who the rightful owners were. According to l'Express, French museum authorities were informed that the works were in Berlin by the French Foreign Affairs Ministry, which had been contacted by authorities in eastern Germany. L'Express recounted how Brauner and his wife, a restoration expert, locked the paintings in a yellow wooden armoire and equipped it with a pail of water and a hydrometer to measure the humidity. From time to time, they would check the paintings' condition, the magazine wrote. During the war, the Nazis sought to amass as much art as possible to fulfill Hitler's dream of creating a European arts center in his native Linz, Austria. Several of his aides, including Martin Bormann and Hermann Goring, were also art collectors and rerouted much of the booty into their own hands.
19891227000000000	DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO THEFT OF PAINTING. Two men charged in the theft of a 17th-Century Dutch painting from an Antelope Valley College art show last month have pleaded not guilty. Jereld Sharitz, a 23-year-old art student at the college, was charged with grand theft. Timothy Cain, Sharitz's 27-year-old roommate, was charged as an accessory, a Lancaster Municipal Court official said. The $18,000 artwork, "Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape" by Gerard Hoet the Elder, was stolen from the college art gallery Nov. 6 during an exhibit of European paintings. Sharitz and Cain were arrested Nov. 28 after investigators acting on a tip served a search warrant at the apartment of the two men and found the painting. The suspects entered not guilty pleas Friday and face a preliminary hearing Jan. 11.
