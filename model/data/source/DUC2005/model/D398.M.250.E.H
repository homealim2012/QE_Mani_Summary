The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty between NATO and Warsaw Pact nations began March 8, 1988 in Vienna, and was signed in Paris on November 19, 1990 -- marking the Cold War's end.
The Warsaw Pact will reduce its European arsenals by 40%, NATO by 3%, for equal arms ceilings.
Both keep in Central Europe 20,000 battle tanks, 30,000 armored vehicles, 20,000 artillery, 6,800 combat planes and 2,000 attack helicopters -- about half current stocks.
They have 40 months to destroy excesses.
Combined East and West German troops go from 600,000 to 370,000.
A separate declaration limits Soviet land-based naval aircraft.
Broader troop talks are to begin.
The first U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty, in 1963, banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, oceans and space.
In 1972, the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty established ceilings on long-range nuclear missiles and bombers higher than either's arsenal -- legalizing further buildup.
In 1979 SALT II reduced USSR missiles, but spawned a quadrupling of unrestricted multiple nuclear warheads.
Initialed in June 1990, for signing in early 1991, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty limited strategic nuclear warheads and platforms.
Side agreements limited chemical weapons and nuclear testing.
START limits both sides to 6,000 nuclear warheads; a maximum of 4,900 on ballistic missiles -- the rest on air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) and bombers; no more than 3,300 on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and no more than 1,540 on Soviet very large ("heavy") ICBMs.
Sea-launched cruise missiles remain unresolved.
START II talks begin in early 1991.
