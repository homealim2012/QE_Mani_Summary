There are many proposed hydroelectric projects being undertaken throughout the world.
Each seems to be encountering problems of a financial, humanitarian, environmental, or political nature.
Dam and hydroelectric projects are currently proposed for China's Yangtze River, in Kenya, in Mexico, in Quebec, in Southern Turkey, in Malaysia, in Slovakia on the Danube River, in Chile, in India on the Narmada River, in Iran, on the Parana River bordering Argentina and Paraguay, in Nepal, in Portugal, and in the Mekong Delta by Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
Ecologists and environmentalists have objected to most of these projects because they will greatly alter the existing ecosystem.
In Vietnam, the spawning grounds of 90%of the region's fish could be destroyed.
Environmentalists also foresee destruction of forests as a problem, particularly in Chile.
Environmentalists claim that some cases, such as the Mekong project, danger of serious flooding could increase.
Projects in China, Malaysia, Quebec, and India would all result in lose of homeland of indigenous populations.
The Mexican project would destroy archeological sites.
Several dam projects have created serious controversies between nations.
Hungary has objected to Slovakia's diverting of the Danube River and is threatening reprisals if the project goes through.
Financial problems have plagued most of the dam sites.
Kenya's project has led to questions about payments to consultants for study of the proposal.
Turkey's economy has been strained by the massive costs of its hydroelectric project with many economists believing that it is the cause of Turkey's 70% rate of inflation.
