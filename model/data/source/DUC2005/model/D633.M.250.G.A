People in Wales who speak Welsh do not feel they are full citizens under British rule while English speakers do.
During the Tory years of Thatcher and Major there were demands in Wales for devolution -- establishing a parliament for Wales.
Leading the devolution fight in Wales was the nationalist party Plaid Cymru.
They claimed that as the UK became increasingly integrated into the European Community it was essential that Wales should be self-governing.
They also wanted to be treated the same as Scotland on devolution.
A referendum was held in 1979 and a majority of the Welsh people voted against devolution.
Opposition was lead by Labor leader Neil Kinnock who claimed that the working class would gain nothing from a Welsh assembly.
Calls for an elected assembly continued, coming mainly from the Welsh Labor party and from Plaid Cymru.
Conservatives opposed devolution.
Since the 19th century Tory ideology included opposition to separatist movements.
John Major in opposing devolution claimed it would raise taxes.
He asserted that the best interests of Wales would be served if existing arrangements were continued.
Tony Blair in the 1994 election campaign said that a Welsh assembly would be established in the first year of a Labor government.
John Major favored a referendum.
The British government in 1993 planned a reorganization of local government in Wales.
It wanted to replace 8 counties and 37 districts with 21 new authorities.
Some Welsh political leaders were concerned that these changes could undermine the independence of local government.
