Cyanide is used in mining to extract precious metals from low-grade ore.
The heap-leach technique uses a water-cyanide solution to dissolve gold, silver, or copper from the ore.
Cyanide also is used to extract precious metals from ore in open pits and tanks.
Mine waste-water poses an environmental hazard.
Leaks contaminate waterways and groundwater.
A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley.
A broken dam spilled cyanide-contaminated water into a creek.
The death of hundreds of birds and other wild animals is alleged to have been caused by contaminated mining holding ponds.
Water diverted for mining use can dry surrounding wells and streams, destroying wildlife habitats.
Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry, where the storage tanks pose a risk of deadly hydrogen cyanide being accidentally released.
Cyanide fumes killed five workers cleaning one tank.
Environmental damage occurred when a leaking holding tank contaminated ground water and when a plating company dumped cyanide-laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer system.
Cyanide is used to extract silver from used x-ray films.
An employee at one of these plants died after inhaling cyanide fumes on the job.
Philippine fishermen use cyanide to catch fish.
This method decimates the fish population and is linked to the destruction of area reefs.
Some garden pesticides contain cyanide.
A fire in a garden store could release dangerous fumes from stored pesticide.
Another use of cyanide is in manufacturing the nutritional supplement tryptophan.
