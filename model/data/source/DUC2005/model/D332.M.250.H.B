Frequently tax-related charges are filed in criminal cases where there are or could be other criminal charges not related to taxes.
Charges of conspiracy, fraud, racketeering and money laundering have been linked with charges of tax evasion.
Accusations of mail fraud, stock fraud, illegal enterprises or banking activities may be connected with charges of tax evasion.
In some of these cases only the tax-related charges are filed although there is obviously suspicion of the non-tax violations.
In some cases a well-known mobster may escape prosecution for seemingly more serious crimes only to be convicted of tax evasion or tax fraud.
Tax charges have been combined with indictment for running a house of prostitution, grand larceny, drug smuggling or other drug charges, and distribution of pornography.
In one case charges of pimping and pandering that would require mandatory prison sentences were dropped in favor of charges of "conspiring to maintain a house of prostitution" and tax evasion.
Payola, accepting kickbacks, embezzlement and sale of steroids have all been charged along with tax evasion or filing fraudulent tax returns.
In an unusual case involving "record industry racketeering" a man was indicted on a bevy of criminal counts including "racketeering, conspiracy to defraud Columbia Records, making undisclosed 'payola' payments to radio stations, mail fraud, filing false tax returns, conspiracy to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service."
