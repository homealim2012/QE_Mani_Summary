People who died as the result of mercy killings, including those who died as a result of doctor-assisted suicide, suffered a broad spectrum of conditions prior to their deaths.
Some were suffering from a severely deteriorated quality of life and others were terminally ill or in irreversible comatose states.
Those suffering from a deteriorated quality of life include the elderly, quadriplegics, those paralyzed by the incurable Lou Gehrig's disease, and those afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and fearing further mental deterioration.
These victims often sought the right to die.
Those terminally ill often suffered from cancer or AIDS, or were victims of severe injuries.
Those in comatose states include injury victims, victims of gunshot and stabbing wounds, disaster victims, and victims of severe physical abuse; there are cases of comatose states being induced by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, drinking a cocaine-laced soft drink, and swallowing a balloon.
The principals performing mercy killings and their methods varied considerably.
They include hospital staff turning off life-support systems; physicians and nurses administering lethal injections; Dr. Kevorkian supplying patients with a device containing lethal drugs for use in committing suicide; a friend fatally shooting an AIDS patient; a brother smothering his ill brother; a husband shooting his wife who suffered from Alzheimer's disease; and a husband suffocating his wife who suffered from cancer.
There are cases of self-anointed "angels of death" giving lethal injections to hospital patients who were not necessarily terminally ill or who had not expressed a right to die.
