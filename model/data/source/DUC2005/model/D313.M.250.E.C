Magnetic levitation rail systems are being developed in several countries.
The revolutionary technology is being tested in Japan and Germany.
However, actual construction has not yet begun.
In Japan, development is underway for a proposed Tokyo-Osaka line.
Construction would be government funded.
Service is expected to begin after 2000, but high costs and difficulties obtaining land could delay it indefinitely.
Germany has approved development of a Hamburg-Berlin "maglev" line.
The government, which already has spent DM1.6bn on research and development, will fund construction, while a private consortium will operate the service.
Service is expected to begin in 2005.
In the US, maglev projects have been proposed for the Los Angeles and Las Vegas areas.
The California project would link downtown Los Angeles, Orange County and the San Fernando Valley.
The line would serve commuters and airport-bound travelers.
It would also serve gamblers headed to Las Vegas via the proposed 69-mile Anaheim-Las Vegas line.
The Los Angeles area line originally was to be privately funded.
California state law prohibits the use of federal or state funds.
However, because ridership estimates have been reduced by half, some county government financing will be necessary.
Issues of costs and rights of way have delayed approval of the Los Angeles area project.
The two projects are not expected to begin service before 1997.
In Switzerland, the government and 80 Swiss companies are financing a feasibility study for an underground maglev system.
The proposed Geneva-St.
Gallen and Basle-Bellinzona lines would take eight years to build.
