Indonesia and Malaysia in Southeast Asia, along with Brazil, were among the world's major producers of tin into the early 1980s.
Tin mining had been ongoing in Malaysia for centuries.
In the mid-19 century, large tracts of land were given over to tin concessions.
Chinese immigrants came to the country to work the tin mines.
The tin industry was the foundation of the wealth of many of Malaysia's early entrepreneurs.
In the early 1980s tin as being replaced by aluminum in beverage containers.
Also thinner coatings of tin were being used to tin-plate steel cans.
The tin market declined further with the collapse in 1985 of a price support scheme operated by tin producers' International Tin Council.
The scheme held prices artificially high and encouraged over-production.
The huge tin stocks accumulated by the ITC contributed to the decline in tin prices.
Increased use of tin in solders and in chemicals was not large enough to offset decreasing demand.
Tin consumption in 1993 was 90 percent below its peak twenty years earlier.
Malaysia's tin industry began disappear rapidly in the earl 1990s.
The main factor for declining production was low prices in the international market; other factors were rising production costs and the depletion of high-grade reserves.
Mines were closed; Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the world's biggest producers, closed all of its mines in 1993.
Mining sites were turned into condominiums for the newly affluent.
Indonesia's tin industry cut production costs in an effort to return to being profitable.
