Proposals for the governing of Wales split more along party lines than national divisions.
Proposed changes in the governance of Wales and Scotland became a major political issue in the 1994 British elections.
In Britain the Tories are in favor of keeping the existing relationship with Wales, perhaps with some internal restructuring of Welsh local government into districts.
The Labour Party, responding to Welsh nationalist protests, favors a Welsh elected assembly giving more autonomy to that country.
In Wales, countrymen are also divided on issues of separation and self-determination.
These divisions fall mainly along language lines with Welsh speakers favoring separation and English speakers preferring to keep the economic benefits of being part of Great Britain.
The most outspoken group for separation is the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, led by Dafydd Wigley.
With only three members in parliament, they seek support from Labour who has promised an independent Welsh Assembly.
Many say that formation of assemblies would only create an expensive restructuring of current local services, (eight counties would be changed into 37 district councils,) and actually threaten local democracy.
Plaid Cymru wants full independence with a Welsh parliament.
Mr. Wigley's vision for the Welsh parliament is equal representation wit half the members being women.
It is predicted that as of 1994, a referendum on independence in Wales would probably receive less than 50% support from its people.
Because of the complexity of the issues, the Welsh government has delayed any legislation regarding proposed changes.
