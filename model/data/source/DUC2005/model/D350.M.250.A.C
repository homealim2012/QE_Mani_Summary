Many health problems are associated with computer use.
Most common are musculo-skeletal injuries known as repetitive strain injuries.
These painful, often debilitating injuries include tenosynovitis, capsulitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, and muscle-pain-spasm syndrome.
Other problems are stress, eyesight problems, headaches, and fatigue.
Computer use may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or birth defects from low-level magnetic radiation, "sick building syndrome," possibly because terminals attract dust and minerals from ventilation systems, and a high incidence of anginal chest pain for video display terminal users.
To avoid problems, use good posture.
Sit upright, feet flat on the floor or foot rest, knees bent at right angles, and lower back supported.
Keyboards should be elbow-height.
Keep natural wrist lines, with elbows hanging free, bent at right angles.
Don't squeeze the mouse.
Position the top of the screen below eye level, adjust the contrast high and brightness low, and reduce glare.
Most important, take breaks every two hours.
Industry and national standards were adopted for workspace configuration to alleviate problems.
New regulations require safety training, mandatory breaks, free eye testing, any necessary eyewear, and flicker-free screens.
Regulations also cover desk, chair, and workstation design, and the immediate work environment, including humidity, lighting, radiation and noise.
Employers must assess and reduce risks.
New equipment has been developed, such as ergonomic keyboards, mice, and chairs, adjustable work stations, and polarized light panels to reduce glare.
Lower-tech devices such as wrist rests, anti-glare screens, special eyeglasses, telephone headsets and document holders also help
