The anti-communist movement in Czechoslovakia forced the collapse of the government in the "velvet revolution" of November 1989.
As reforms got underway, tensions developed between Czechs and Slovaks.
Slovakia's economic difficulties during the reforms fueled an emerging nationalism.
Slovakia's unemployment rate was three times the Czech rate.
Differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks came to a head in the June 1992 election.
Vladimir Meciar won in Slovakian regions, bringing Slovak nationalists to power, and Vaclav Klaus won in Czech lands.
Because of differing views on the future composition of the Czechoslovak republic, after the election Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to prepare to split Czechoslovakia into two separate states.
In the fall of 1992 the leaders work worked on the details for dividing Czechoslovakia, ranging from division of the federal army to apportioning the foreign debt.
In November, the Czech and Slovak parliaments voted to split into two independent republics in January 1993.
Outlooks for the two republics during the first year differed considerably.
The split left the Czech Republic free to pursue its drive towards a free-market economy.
They continued privatizing efforts and built markets in the European Community, especially with Germany.
Slovakia was saddled with a high concentration of heavy industry geared to the Soviet market.
Its flawed leadership and its slow pace of privatization and little foreign investment hampered its ability to compete in international trade.
By the end of 1993, its economy was in deep recession, inflation was above 25 percent, and unemployment was rising.
