From 1990 to 1992 there were three major boundary disputes occurring.
The first, a dispute over the Spratley Islands involving China and Viet Nam and to a lesser extent Malasia, Brunei, Taiwan, and the Philippines.
These islets became an issue when China granted an oil exploration concession to a US company in an area claimed by Viet Nam.
This move threatened the oil industry of Viet Nam.
Ten years after the conclusion of war, Britain and Argentina are again in dispute over the waters around the Falkland Islands.
Britain has begun seismic studies in hopes of drilling for oil in the waters surrounding the islands.
Argentina wants results of the survey negotiations.
Britain has agreed to cooperate with Argentina because they will need to use Argentinian land for the supporting the oil industry.
There also been disputes between the two countries over fishing rights.
A third dispute over territorial rights involving oil is between Greece and Turkey regarding the continental shelf under the Aegean Sea.
Greece has opened the way for oil exploration, but has agreed to international arbitration regarding seabed mineral rights.
They have rejected Turkey's proposals for joint exploration of the area.
A territorial dispute has been settled between Denmark and the Faroe Islands.
The Danish government has agreed to hand over all mineral rights to the Faroese government.
Another potential dispute could be over oil rights in Crimea in the Black Sea currently controlled by Britain, but with interest from the Ukraine, American, Dutch, and Norwegian companies.
