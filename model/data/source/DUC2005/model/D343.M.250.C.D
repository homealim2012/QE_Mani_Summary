A 1990 edition of the LA Times printed statistics on deaths of Los Angeles Police Department officers from 1907 to 1990.
During those years 175 officers had died in the line of duty, 88 killed by suspects, 36 in car crashes, 31 in motorcycle collisions, 6 in helicopter accidents, and 14 in other incidents including bomb explosions.
There were many extenuating circumstances that indirectly contributed to the cause of death in LA and elsewhere.
For example, San Jose police officers sued their city charging that inadequate staffing contributed to the shooting death of an officer by a crazed gunman.
Two other officers died when they went to investigate a shooting incident, only to discover a pipe bomb in the garage of the home.
They died when the bomb they were trying to dismantle exploded.
Another officer died of acute and chronic infections suffered after receiving gunshot wounds five years previously.
One off-duty policeman, trying to stop an armed robbery at a restaurant, was shot by the gunman.
Another officer was killed when he was struck by a car while directing traffic.
Still another was struck by a drunk driver while issuing a citation to another motorist.
One officer was shot and killed during an undercover operation while disguised as a drug dealer.
He was ambushed as he attempted to sell narcotics.
The number of police officers killed on drug-related duty nationwide reached an all time high in 1988 with the death of 14 officers.
