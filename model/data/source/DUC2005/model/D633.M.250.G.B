As of December 1994 the issue of restructuring the Welsh government (devolution) remained a hot issue in Britain.
Basically the Labour Party under the new leadership of Tony Blair had pledged to create a Welsh assembly within a year of its election to power.
(Devolution had not been a major issue in the 1992 general election).
The ruling Conservative Party offered a plan in 1993 for 21 "unitary authorities" in Wales to replace the existing 8 county and 37 district councils as organs of local government, but opposed the creation of a distinct Welsh "assembly" or parliament.
Conservative Prime Minister Major suggested a referendum on the issue of a Welsh assembly, but Blair countered that the issue of devolution would be central to the next general election campaign and if Labour won that would settle the issue.
In Parliament Labour generally stood with Blair while Conservatives preached national unity.
The Council of Welsh Districts urged the government to go ahead with its plan for 21 unitary authorities while the Assembly of Welsh Counties rejected the plan holding out for a Welsh Assembly.
