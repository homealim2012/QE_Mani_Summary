The Amazon rainforest, the world's largest, contains 30 percent of the world's plant and animal species.
The rainforest has serious environmental problems stemming from destruction of forest cover, from exploitation of the rainforest's mineral resources and hydroelectric potential, from oil exploration, from population growth, and from economic policies.
These problems include loss of biodiversity; habitat destruction, less oxygen, and an increased threat of global warming all resulting from deforestation; disruption of the carbon cycle caused by forest burning; soil depletion and erosion caused by over-harvesting and loss of trees; water and air pollution caused by oil spills; and environmental damage caused by mining.
Deforestation is the result of several activities, including clearing land for farming and cattle ranching; constructing roads for mining, oil exploration, and logging operations; and logging of rainforest timber.
Forest burning, a widely used method for clearing land, is often the product of government actions.
To encourage development, ranchers and others have received government subsidies in Brazil for burning forests.
Government policies have encouraged poor farmers to settle on forestlands, where they use fire for clearing land.
Many actions are being taken to solve or at least reduce environmental problems.
Among them are establishing environmental and economic zoning to protect endangered species; introducing tree harvesting methods less harmful to the forest and engaging in reforestation projects; and applying agroforestry methods to cultivate profitable combinations of crops and trees to reduce soil erosion and make unnecessary slash-and-burn farming.
Abolishing subsidies has virtually eliminated forest destruction by ranchers.
