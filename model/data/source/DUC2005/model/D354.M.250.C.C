Journalism is an increasingly dangerous profession.
Journalists of today are bold and insist on asking tough questions and challenging authority whenever it appears to be abusive.
Sometimes they are endangered accidentally by the situations they cover, such as those arrested covering a rock concert riot, and those whose car burst into flames while driving past a burning oilfield in Kuwait.
More often they are at risk because they plunge into situations of political conflict and unrest and crusade against political corruption and oppression.
Covering political unrest or wars, journalists are often caught in the crossfire of the fighting.
However, they are more often targeted by one or another side of a conflict.
Numerous journalists have been killed, wounded or kidnapped by opposition forces in dozens of countries.
In the Middle East, journalists have been targeted by extremist groups who kill some, and hold others hostage in an attempt to force government action.
Journalists often fall victim to the repressive regimes they crusade against.
They have been executed as spies, unlawfully detained, and beaten.
Some are attacked to intimidate other journalists.
They have suffered retaliation for their parts in uprisings, been exiled, jailed, forced to recant, and denied their jobs.
Even émigré journalists have been attacked for their muckraking publications abroad.
Journalists have been victimized for pursuing stories of official corruption, drug trafficking, and mafia activities.
Not only have drug traffickers and cartels targeted journalists, but public officials who fear exposure of their connections to them have, as well.
