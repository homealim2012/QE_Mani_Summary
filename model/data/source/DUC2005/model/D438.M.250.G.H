According to the British Tourism Authority, United Kingdom tourism revenue growth averaged 13 percent annually from 1985 to 1993.
1993 was a record year for tourists visiting the UK, up 4 percent over 1992.
1993 revenues rose 15 percent.
A 3.6 percent visitor increase was forecast for 1994.
From 1983 to 1993 UK tourism sector employment rose 31 percent, well above the rate for the entire economy.
Tourism is a leading industry in the UK, being 5.6 percent of gross domestic product and earning pounds 10 bn annually in foreign exchange.
It is 6 percent of UK employment.
Tourism accounts for 20 percent of northern Scotland's gross domestic product and employs 20 percent of its workforce.
Tourism had shown slow but steady growth until global recession downturns in recent years ending 1991.
After some increasing tourism to Scotland in 1992, in April to June 1993 its tourism business sector profits, new jobs, and pay raises all rose further slightly, while most other sectors declined.
The UK economy was not helped by the decline from 1982 to 1992 in the UK's tourism account foreign exchange balance (foreign visitor revenues minus UK travelers' spending abroad) from breakeven to a pounds 3.1 bn deficit.
In 1993 the UK's tourism foreign exchange deficit worsened further by 8.8 percent, because the number of foreign holidays taken by UK residents rose 8 percent.
UK domestic tourism remains stagnant since 1972.
There is room for growth in a global tourism market expanding 5 percent annually since 1970.
