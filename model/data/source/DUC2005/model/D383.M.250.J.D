Until the 1990s, patients suffering from depression and other mental disorders relied on drugs such as Valium and Xanax which often had major side effects such as patient drowsiness and sluggishness.
The side effects of anti-schizophrenic medicines such as Thorazine used before l990 included tics and twitches, motor disturbances, persistent restlessness and even heart failure.
In the 1990s a new class of drugs came on the market, the most popular of which was Prozac.
A similar drug, Zoloft, also became commonly used in the treatment of depression.
Both medications have greatly improved the lives of those suffering from depression.
Prozac can have side effects of insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, nausea, and sexual problems, but is mostly considered a safe drug.
The Church of Scientology, however, has associated Prozac with incidences of suicide and filed a suit to have Prozac removed from the market.
Manufacturer, Eli Lilly, found no relationship between Prozac and suicide in their trials.
The new generation of drugs for treatment of schizophrenia include risperidone and bromoperidol.
They promise to help those suffering from the disease to lead a normal life.
Another medication, clozapine is being used with people with severe schizophrenia.
It is limited to cases not responsive to other medication because it can cause a fatal blood disorder.
In 1990, The FDA approved a drug to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The drug is clomipramine sold under the trade name of Anafranil.
Anafranil is associated with side effects such as dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, increased appetite, and impotence.
