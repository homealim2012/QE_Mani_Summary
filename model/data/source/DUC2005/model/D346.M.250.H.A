Educational reforms aimed at improving student academic or vocational performance, such as the use of standardized national tests, changes to teaching practices and teacher training, and reforms targeted for specific groups, raise numerous issues.
Standardized national tests are used in the UK and proposed for the US.
There are questions surround what testing hopes to achieve and whether it actually brings about improved performance.
Other issues include the possible disruptive effects on students of test preparation and test taking, and whether testing kills educational diversity and inhibits teachers.
Controversy surrounds the question of making public test results for individual schools.
Teacher unions have threatened to boycott testing.
Issues revolving about reforms to teaching practices include the use whole-class and subject specific teaching; the use of a "back to-basics" approach to counter falling standards of performance; the use a national curriculum featuring a basic core of subjects; and use of standards for academic performance to be evaluated by testing.
Other issues are the size of classes, the length of school days, and the choice of schools.
Teacher training issues include the proper balance between subject matter and theory taught to teachers and the amount and type of in-service teacher training needed to improve subject matter knowledge and to meet the demands of a national curriculum.
Curriculum reforms for inner-city students and for vocational students are controversial.
Other issues include whether to manage inner-city schools locally or centrally, and whether vocational schools are producing students equipped to satisfy the needs of industry.
