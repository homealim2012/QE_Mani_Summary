In 1992 the FDA made significant changes to labels on food products.
Before 1992 food processors did not have to list nutritional information on labels unless they had added a nutrient to the food.
At that time a comprehensive label consisted of three basic parts; the amount of calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and sodium per serving.
There were fairly liberal regulations permitting health claims so that a high fiber cereal, for example, could contain a message claiming the cereal would reduce the risk of colon cancer and heart disease.
During this period several companies, including Ragu and Proctor and Gamble, were cited for misleading consumers.
The definition of serving size was unclear so that a 12 ounce can of soda was described as being two servings although it was usually consumed by one person straight from the can.
The new FDA regulations give consumers more nutritional information.
Every packaged item must give full details of caloric and nutritional content.
New strict definitions exist for terms such as low-fat, high fiber, light, or sodium-free.
Cholesterol- free means specifically that the product has less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol and low-cholesterol is defined as less than 20 milligrams per serving.
More information must be given for perishable foods and the temperatures at which they should be stored.
Information about food additives and ingredients must be presented according to uniform rules.
The definition of serving size has been standardized.
The European Union adopted many of the same guidelines during the same period.
