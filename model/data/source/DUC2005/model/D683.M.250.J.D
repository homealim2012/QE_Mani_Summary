When the Soviet yoke lifted from Czechoslovakia, historic nationalistic feelings arose again.
The Czechs, representing 2/3s of the country's population, were highly industrialized and Western looking with strong ties to Germany.
Slovakia still had stronge ties to the East, it's factories producing heavy goods geared to Soviet markets.
It was also suffering high unemployment rates.
The two regions were unable to agree on a political plan for coexistence.
In the election of 1992, the Slovak nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by charismatic Vladamir Meciar, won a large percentage of the vote.
His party pushed for greater economic and political autonomy for Slovakia and prevented the re-election of Vaclav Havel.
Compromises for political federation failed and it was agreed that the two parts of the country would "divorce".
Several agreements regarding currency, trade, borders, etc. were instituted.
Most agreements lasted a very short time.
Six weeks after the separation, each country had it's own currency.
Since the breakup, Slovakia has faced economic stress, higher unemployment, and some political upheaval since many of its citizens were not in favor of complete independence.
It is attempting to modernize, but is faced with the heavy costs involved.
The Slovak government has managed to gain international recognition and join many world institutions.
The Czech Republic, on the other hand, has been blessed with increased prosperity, one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe, substantial foreign investment, and a thriving tourist trade.
The Republic is working toward rapid integration into the European market.
