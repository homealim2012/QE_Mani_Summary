The research and development process for creating new drugs and releasing them to market consists of three steps: drug discovery; drug testing; and drug launching and continuing support.
One group of activities involved in the process consists of mainly scientific efforts and a second group consists of efforts to manage the process.
The aim of activities in the drug discovery step is to develop a product that satisfies an unmet need in an important therapeutic area.
Scientists exhaustively test thousands of drugs to eliminate ineffective compounds and identify those potentially useful.
Their activities can include using an automated testing system to screen compounds, performing searches of compound databases, applying molecular modelling techniques, using gene-splicing machines, and designing, by means of a computer-aided process, a drug that targets RNA responsible for synthesizing diseased protein.
Drug testing activities deal with determining the efficacy and safety of a drug.
It is the longest and most expensive aspect of drug development, involving years of preclinical and clinical tests on humans.
When a drug is approved by regulatory agencies, it is released to the market with accompanying marketing activities.
Continuing support activities include conducting clinical testing to determine long-term health effects of the drug and conducting studies to determine whether it can be used to treat other illnesses.
Management activities include efforts to reduce drug development costs, such as by reducing the time between drug discovery and market release and by setting up clinical trials to be conducted simultaneously in the US, Europe, and Japan.
