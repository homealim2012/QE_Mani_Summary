Nobel prizes are award each year for achievements in the physical sciences -- physics, chemistry, medicine, economics, literature and for peace.
Winners in physics include Norman Ramsey, Wolfgang Paul and Hans Delmelt in 1989 for work leading to the cesium atomic clock; Jerome Friedman, Henry Kendall and Richard Taylor in 1990 for first detecting quarks; Georges Charpak in 1992 for particle detectors; and Betran Brockhouse and Clifford Shull in 1994 for work on neutron scattering.
Chemistry winners include Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech in 1989 for work on RNA; Elias Cory in 1990 for work on organic synthesis; and Rudolph Marcus in 1992 for electron transfer theory.
Winners in medicine include J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus in 1989 for contributions to cancer research; Joseph Murray and E. Donnall Thomas in 1990 for work on organ transplants; Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp in 1993 for cancer research; and Alfred Gilman and Martin Rodbell in 1994 for work on proteins.
Among winners in economics are Robert Fogel and Douglas North in 1993 for work on causes of economic change; Gary Becker in 1992 for work on the economics of discrimination and human capital theory; and John Harsanyi, John Nash and Rheinhard Selten in 1994 for work on game theory.
Winners share some common background factors, One is that generally took five and 20 years between a discovery and its recognition.
Another is that most winners in certain fields were Americans -- of 142 medicine prizes awarded, 69 were to Americans.
