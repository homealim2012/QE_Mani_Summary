19970208000000000	Primary Education Project Launched in Kenya. NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has launched the phase two of the Strengthening Primary Education (SPRED) project in a bid to increase enrollment rate in primary schools. The Project was jointly developed by the Kenyan and British governments, and the Overseas Development Authority (ODA) of Britain is scheduled to provide about 30 million U.S. Dollars to support the project. At the launching ceremony held on Friday, Kenyan Education Minister Joseph Kamotho said that the enrollment rate in primary schools standing at 95 percent in 1989 declined to about 87 percent last year. The minister attributed the decline to ineffective teaching methods, wide-spread poverty and poor management of schools. On the same occasion, British Minister for Overseas Development Lynda Chalker noted that the situation in Kenya's education sector is so critical that only 35 percent of the current seven million school-age children can expect to complete primary education. She pointed out that "this is a tragic waste of the tremendous potential which every girl and boy has within them." The project is one of the largest projects ever undertaken by the ODA in the primary education sub-sector throughout the world, the minister stated. During the phase one already completed, the ODA provided more than seven million Dollars to buy textbooks and science equipment for primary schools in arid and semi-arid areas. The phase two is aimed at improving the quality of primary education including the training of primary school head teachers throughout the east African country. According to Kamotho, the training program has already begun and about 800 head masters are undergoing management training courses in various teacher-training colleges.
19970415000000000	Kenya to Conduct Family Life Education. NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will provide family life education to children and youth so as to make them ready for responsible parenthood, according to No. 1 Sessional Paper of 1997. The government will strengthen existing child-youth programs and formulate new plans to deal with reproductive health, adolescent fertility, education and employment, said the paper. The move aims to help Kenyans under age 24 to solve problems facing them, which are identified as sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, teenage pregnancies, abortion and drug abuse. As many as 55 percent of Kenyans are under 18 years old and the Kenyan youth, defined between age 15 and 24, accounts for one-fifth of the total population. According to the paper, Kenya would make the population problem central to all national development agenda because its population is the greatest asset in the development of natural capital.
19970612000000000	Kenya to Open Enterprise Course in Primary. NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided to introduce enterprise education in primary schools to inculcate a business culture among children in the eastern African country. The new subject, Entrepreneurship Education, will focus on practical aspects of business management and industrial development, Education Minister Joseph Kamotho announced on Tuesday in a statement. "The intention is to inculcate a business and enterprising culture in the minds of learners at an early age," he claimed. However, it is just an additional one to the 13 subjects taught in primary schools and will be non-examinable. The move is one of the eight strategies for training and human resource development in preparation for the country's industrialization, said Kamotho. Other strategies include strengthening of educational and training programs for the disabled, ensuring street children get access to education and offering a second chance to drop-outs to improve their literacy and get short-time career training. Training in the country's institutions would be harmonized with the labor market requirements to correct the mismatch between labor supply and demand, he stressed.
19970613000000000	Pupil Enrollment Down in Kenya. NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The annual gross enrollment in Kenya's primary schools fell by two percent to 55 percent this year mainly due to the introduction of cost-sharing in schools, which has locked out children from poor background. Moreover, 23 percent of the pupils enrolled in the country's 16,000 primary schools dropped out before reaching grade five between 1990 and 1995, according to a lastest Human Development Report. The decline was also a result of lack of adequate teaching facilities and qualified teachers in many schools in the eastern African country, the local press quoted the report as saying today. The requirement that children must go to school in uniform, buy a variety of textbooks and pay numerous levies and fees have also contributed to the drop in school enrollment, said the report. However, Kenya's adult illiteracy rate was sharply down to 21.9 percent in 1995 from about 35 percent in previous years, said the report. Earlier, Kenyan Education Director Sammy Kyungu said the government has drafted guidelines to liberalize the education sector in the next century. Under the guidelines, procurement of textbooks, supply and distribution would be school-based rather than dependent on the Kenya Institute of Education, he said on Thursday.
19970904000000000	Kenyan Teachers to Go on Strike over Pay. NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- About 240,000 teachers around Kenya will go on strike on October 1 if the government fails to meet their salary hike demands within 28 days, local press reported today. The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) sent the strike threat to Minister for Labor and Manpower Development Philip Masinde Wednesday following a crisis meeting of the KNUT national executive council. The union is demanding a salary increase ranging between 150 and 200 percent as recommended by the remunerations committee, instead of 10-to-28 percent announced by Education Minister Joseph Kamotho Monday. "The teachers have resolved that they will not accept anything sort of the full implementation of the recommendations" made by the committee, said KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo Wednesday. According to the recommendations, the lowly paid teacher should get a minimum of 5,640 Shillings a month, with a top bar of 7,079 Shillings. The highest paid teacher (chief principal) is to get a minimum of 42,240 Shillings, with a top bar of 52,246 Shillings. Currently around 62 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar. The remunerations committee also recommended automatic house allowance for all cadre of teachers, with the lowest being 4,700 Shillings a month up from 640 Shillings. A chief principal is to get 35,200 Shillings a month, up from 8,700 Shillings. Others are motor vehicle, transfer, hardship, commuter and accommodation allowances. In contrast, under the Kamotho's announcement, the lowest paid teacher will start at 2,405 Shillings a month, up from 1,880 Shillings. The highest starts at 21,000 up from 19,115 Shillings, with a ceiling 25,840 Shillings. The KNUT has described Kamotho's package as an insult to the teachers in charge of about seven million children in the country's primary and secondary schools. Meanwhile, Kamotho argued that the government is unable to give the hefty pay rise and lucrative benefits the committee had recommended because of inadequate budgetary allocations.
19971007000000000	Teachers' Strike Talks Deadlock in Kenya. NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The talks on teachers' pay dispute between the Kenyan government and the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) has reached a deadlock, the Daily Nation reported today. The paper said that the teachers' union vowed to continue with the four-day-long strike until the Kenyan government meets its demands. The government issued a statement last night, advising all teachers who started a nationwide strike on October 1 to report to their duty stations by 8 a.m. tomorrow or face unspecified punishment. The statement signed by Kenyan Education Minister Joseph Kamotho was issued when the talks aimed at ending the strike was going on under the chairmanship of Labour Minister Philip Masinde. After learning this development, John Katumanga, Chairman of the Teachers Service Commission said that "it is unfair, immoral and against all known labour laws to make prejudicial statements when the talks were going on." The striking teachers are demanding a salary increase ranging between 150 and 200 percent, but the government has agreed to give a 10 to 28 percent salary increment. The KNUT Secretary General Ambrose Adongo noted that "we went to the talks with an open mind" and prepared a proposal of spreading the salary increase over a three-year period. However, he stressed, the Kenyan government has not offered anything new to the teachers at the talks and kept on saying there is no money. Sources here said that the talks had to be adjourned to facilitate "further consultations at the political level" and to "give the parties time to see whether all grounds were acceptable to them."

Presenting a paper "Role of Women in the East African Cooperation (EAC)", Alot said when full fledged, the evisaged women's regional organization will among others, serve as a center for articulation, harmonization, and promoting of women's rights and roles within the framework of the EAC and regional integration. Alot said that the apex body will also address issues such as women's participation in decision-making at all levels and access to social resources, including education, employment, health and population services. He stressed, "Women account for roughly 50 percent of the combined population of the three (EAC) member states of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania" and the EAC cannot ignore the plight or contribution of half of its human resource while pursuing regional integration and development. Alot noted that what women need and deserve is nothing more and nothing less than the affirmation of their equal rights and opportunities under the law and in the society at large.

Garcia Marito, a World Bank official in charge of regional Early Childhood Development Project, said that other targets include health and nutrition, community support grant, pre-school to primary school transition, and sound early childhood education monitoring and evaluation. World Bank's intervention has been necessitated by a strong need for well-trained pre-school teachers in this east African country, said Marito.

Currently, the sub-sector has a teaching force of 36,129. Out of them, only 16,500 are fully trained. According to the data from the Kenyan Ministry of Education and Human Resources, the enrollment rose to the current 1,064,053 pupils from 844,796 in 1980.

19990402000000000	Kenya Urges Unified Education System in E. Africa. NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Ministry of East African and Regional Cooperation has called for the harmonization of education in the east African region, including similar curricula and certification. Permanent Secretary Samuel Ambuka said the move would help attain a state of singularity in the region's economic management and social organization, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday. Ambuka noted Thursday that Kenya's 8-4-4 education system, which means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and four years of university, was different from the 7-4-2-3 structure in both Uganda and Tanzania, which made regional integration difficult. "It brings in the problems of differences in the basic skills and knowledge a student ought to have to acquire at the various levels of education, and the question of assessment of points and credits in the three countries," he noted. He suggested that the three east African nations set up joint teams to study curricula, examination and certification of primary, secondary and college education as a basis for harmonization of curricula and certification. On Kenya's 8-4-4 curricula, Ambuka admitted that it emphasized a wide range of subjects at the expense of in-depth analysis.

19991005000000000	U.N. Agency Urges Kenya to Adopt Sex Education. NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has urged Kenya's Education Ministry to include sex education in the curriculum. The UNICEF country representative Chrispin Wilson said Monday that it was essential to provide information about HIV/AIDS to the youth in order to curb the spread of the killer disease. "Using schools as the means to reach children aged between five and 14 to induce behaviour change through HIV/AIDS education are some of the best methods to try to stop the spread of the virus," said Wilson. Kenya will have about 850,000 AIDS orphans by the year 2000, according to Wilson. The newly infected were young people in Kenya, where the HIV infection rate has reached 13 to 14 percent, said Wilson. He observed that the age group most at risk was between 15 and 24 and girls aged between 15 and 19 were at a much higher risk of contracting the virus than boys. Kenya's Catholic church leaders and some politicians are strongly against adolescent sex education citing it would mislead young people.
