Jury Finds Simpson Liable in Wrongful Death of Ex wife Friend.
WASHINGTON February 4 (Xinhua) A civil jury found former American football star O.
Simpson liable for the wrongful death of his ex wife and her friend according to television report from Santa Monica California on Tuesday.
Simpson 49 was acquitted in October 1995 in the criminal trial for the slashing murders of his ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman but the victims relatives filed a civil wrongful death suit against him seeking monetary damages.
dollars in compensatory damages and will return Thursday to decide whether to award millions more in punitive damages.
Earlier Tuesday the jury in the wrongful death suit was read back statements by several witnesses including testimony pertaining to Simpson s whereabouts on the evening of June 12 1994 when Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were killed outside her home.
WASHINGTON July 14 (Xinhua) Former football star O.
Simpson s house was sold at auction today for 2.
The sale was held outside the courthouse in Los Angeles suburban Norwalk.
Patrick Dobiesz representing lender Hawthorne Savings opened the bidding.
Four times another bidder added one dollar to the pot.
By buying the property Hawthorne Savings can sell it privately for a much higher price.
It also eliminates any excess money that would have been used to pay part of a 33.
Although Simpson was acquitted of murder during a criminal trial he was found liable for the killings in a wrongful death trial that ended earlier this year.
The 6 200 square foot home in Los Angeles wealthy Brentwood section which Simpson has lived in for 20 years has six baths a tennis court waterfalls and an Olympic size swimming pool.
It was unclear how quickly Simpson would have to move out.
He said he will remain in the home with his two youngest children for a while hoping to find another residence in Brentwood by this fall.
5 million judgment against him provoked bitter angry reactions from the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
Denise Brown Nicole s sister said Friday the family responded to news of the appeal by stripping the name Simpson from the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation which helps victims of domestic violence.
Fred Goldman the father of Ronald Goldman called the appeal further proof positive that this monster doesn t want to be held responsible for his actions.
Golfing in Louisiana Simpson said the appeal was his fundamental right.
I think in America justice is supposed to be fair and it s supposed to be blind Simpson told reporters and public opinion or certain prejudices are not supposed to count.
You re supposed to go by the law and I don t think any person involved in the law who looked at that trial and looked at some of the rulings would say it was legal.
Goldman contends that Simpson has become adept at shielding his income from the Goldman family as they try to collect on the huge judgment.
For instance Goldman said Simpson recently granted a paid interview to a German television station and asked the station to pay the money to a third party.
We ll continue to chase him and file suit against those he fraudulently conveys money to Goldman said.
In February 1997 a civil jury found Simpson liable for the stabbing deaths of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.
The appeal filed 17 months after that verdict could take months or even years to resolve.
In 1995 a criminal jury acquitted Simpson of murder charges.
Simpson s attorneys filed the 96 page appeal last week with the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles labeling the civil trial fundamentally tainted by several erroneous evidentiary rulings.
The former football star s attorneys said the judge should have excluded evidence that Simpson had a history of violence against his former wife.
They also said the judge s rulings thwarted their efforts to prove then Officer Mark Fuhrman of the Los Angeles Police Department planted a bloody glove at Simpson s estate.
The brief criticizes the inclusion of several civil trial witnesses including a veterinary clinic worker who claims she saw the couple fight over a fur coat and a former security guard who testified Simpson smashed a windshield and dented a Mercedes Benz coupe with a baseball bat in a jealous rage.
Peter Gelblum one of the Goldmans attorneys predicted the appeal wouldn t have much success.
It s the same issues we litigated twice already in the trial court he said.
The Goldmans attorneys said they will continue to pursue Simpson s assets.
Later this year they plan to auction off his Heisman Trophy Gelblum said.
Los Angeles attorney Nathanial Friedman who successfully sued Charles Manson on behalf of the family of one of Manson s victims called Simpson s appeal an absolutely outrageous abuse of the taxpayer supported court system of California.
His guilt is so self evident that any reasonable person says he would have emigrated to Brazil or Mozambique or some other place if he had the slightest shred of decency Friedman said.
federal tax agency wants the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson to pay dlrs 6.

(AP) Potential bidders expressed qualms about buying O.
Simpson s seized possessions as they viewed the collection in advance of Tuesday night s auction.
I find the whole thing a little bit sad to take away the Heisman Trophy said Gary Nickerson of Los Angeles who came to view another auction lot but stopped by the Simpson display on Friday.
Simpson s 1968 trophy the most prestigious award in college football is the most valuable item to be auctioned.
The catalog noted as did viewers that the word athletic is misspelled as atletic on the trophy s plaque.
Auction officials who will be taking bids on site and via the Internet were unwilling to predict a price on the trophy.
It s the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction said Michael Schwartz director of entertainment memorabilia for the Butterfield and Butterfield auction house.
The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson s home at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
They won a civil wrongful death suit after Simpson was acquitted of the murders in criminal court.
Among viewers who showed up for the preview was Alfred Beardsley a longtime collector of Simpson memorabilia who said he would be bidding even though I feel like I m paying a ransom.
He said he objects to the auction of Simpson s possessions to help satisfy the 33.
It bothers me that I m putting money in the Goldman and Brown pockets Beardsley said.
I believe he s not responsible for this crime and I think there are a lot of people who believe that.
Among items displayed in a small corner of the auction gallery were numerous engraved plaques cups and bowls awarded to Simpson during his athletic career.
The only personal item of clothing was a fox fur coat once owned by Simpson s first wife Marguerite.
Simpson s Garage Sale of the Century takes place online.

You may have already seen the flashier stuff up for grabs such as his 68 Heisman trophy expected to fetch more than 100 000.
But included in the 77 pieces are many other awards given to him through the years.

Simpson s Heisman Memorial Trophy fetched 230 000 at an auction Tuesday intended to raise money for the families of his ex wife and her friend Ron Goldman.
The total amount raised by the sale of 74 items was 430 000 but the families of the two slaying victims will receive only about 382 000 once auction house fees and other costs are subtracted.
The amount collected today won t even put a scratch in the 33.
Myers the state court receiver appointed to oversee the liquidation of Simpson s property.
The auction was intended to partially satisfy the civil judgment owed by Simpson to the families of Goldman and his ex wife.
A civil jury held Simpson liable for their stabbing deaths in February 1997 two years after Simpson was acquitted by a criminal jury on murder charges.
The buyer of the Heisman Trophy an East Coast collector did not want to be identified said officials with the Butterfield and Butterfield auction house in Hollywood.
Bidding for the Heisman started at 75 000 and quickly rose above 200 000.
Marty Cohen of Cleveland came close to getting the trophy with a bid of 220 000 but decided to hold off when he realized that the East Coast collector would top his bid.
I just wanted to put it in my house and let it collect dust and say God.
I m a Heisman Trophy winner said Cohen a real estate developer who last played football in the ninth grade.
Another private collector Randy Burkett said he also wanted a Heisman but did not want to spend more than 100 000.
We just wanted a piece of it said Burkett who came from Amarillo Texas for the auction of items that were seized from Simpson s Brentwood estate in March 1997 by the Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department.
The most coveted item and the last to be auctioned was the Heisman Memorial Trophy awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a senior at the University of Southern California.
The bronze statute the most prestigious award in college football is the only one ever auctioned.
I was very pleased with the overall result (of the auction) said Ira M.
Friedman who represented the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson.
Nicole Brown Simpson s estate is expected to receive one third of the auction proceeds while Goldman s family should receive two thirds Myers said.
About 500 people including a crush of media attended the auction.
The professional football Hall of Fame Award that had been presented to Simpson went at auction for 10 000 to representatives of a computer Web site who said they plan to destroy the certificate and some Simpson football jerseys on Wednesday to protest failings in the criminal justice system.
(Criminal) Courthouse (Wednesday) at noon said Bob Enyart a representative of the Web site shadowgov.
Enyart said the group which spent 4 750 for two football jerseys had planned for two weeks to buy and destroy these items.
Jeff Mohr 43 of North Hollywood said it appeared many people were drawn to the auction by morbid curiosity.
You have a lot of people who bid from the heart and not the mind said Mohr a U.
Indeed some of the items went for far more than their estimated value especially the football jerseys and golf bags.
The Simpson golf bags with clubs went on average for about 2 200.
A simple white football jersey with red stripes and the number 32 estimated to be worth at least 400 went for 4 500.
A Hall of Fame commemorative football valued at 200 to 300 went for 2 250.
A Tiffany style leaded glass lamp shade valued at 600 to 900 went for 7 000.
Simpson memorabilia went up in flames to a chorus of cheers and boos Wednesday a day after it was sold at auction to help pay off the 33.
5 million judgment he owes in the deaths of ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend.
32 football jerseys and a Professional Football Hall of Fame induction certificate were burned and two trophies were smashed outside the Criminal Courts Building in a protest organized by a Christian radio talk show host who purchased 16 000 worth of items.
The auction Tuesday raised 430 000 including 255 500 for Simpson s Heisman Trophy.
courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying justice before our very eyes protest organizer Bob Enyart of Denver said.
The destruction was criticized by some spectators at the downtown courthouse and by Simpson who said it was a waste.
I wonder about the mentality involved in this Simpson said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
The guy s burning up 16 000 he could use to fight AIDS or help kids with cancer or even donate to battered (women s) homes.
Several hundred spectators booed and cheered at the destruction of the items which included jerseys from the University of Southern California and the National Football League s Buffalo Bills and two 1973 Lifesaver trophies apparently given for charity contributions.
The Heisman was the auction s big item and was not part of Wednesday s demonstration.
The winning bid of 255 500 came from an anonymous East Coast collector.
Money raised by the court ordered auction goes to the estate of Ms.
A jury made the award in a wrongful death lawsuit that followed Simpson s acquittal on criminal charges in the 1994 killings.
Also auctioned off were football awards artwork Tiffany style lamps and a fox fur coat that belonged to Simpson s first wife Marguerite.
The prices surprised some collectors because Simpson sports memorabilia hasn t been selling well.
There s a real sour taste in their mouths said Scott Welkowsky owner of Out of This World Memorabilia in Orange County.
Simpson s Heisman Trophy was identified Thursday as a Philadelphia sheet metal dealer who said he wanted to impress his girlfriend.
Tom Juice Kriessman 47 showed up at an auction house to collect the trophy which was awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a star at the University of Southern California.
Kriessman bought the prize anonymously at a court ordered auction of Simpson memorabilia Tuesday.
One of the first reasons was I wanted to impress my girlfriend Kriessman said.
It represents the story of a man who rose to be a superstar and lost it all overnight.
s whole career what happened you know the tragedy that was his life.
I just think in the future it s going to be worth a lot of money.
Kriessman was given the same nickname as Simpson when he played rough touch football in his 20s in Philadelphia.
His girlfriend whom Kriessman didn t identify apparently wasn t the only one impressed by the trophy.
Seems everybody wants to touch it everybody wants to be photographed with it.
Kriessman is the co owner of Triad Steel Inc a 10 year old company that buys and sells sheet metal.
Partner Edward O Brien said Triad has annual sales of about 20 million.
5 million a jury ordered Simpson to pay when it held him liable for the slayings of his ex wife and her friend Ron Goldman.
Kriessman also bought a couple of jerseys and a glass trophy but the Heisman was the top ticket item.
Kriessman a Philadelphia Eagles fan said he has never met Simpson.
Asked if he would like to hear from the former Buffalo Bills star and perhaps pose with him and the Heisman he said.
LOS ANGELES (AP) Is America ready to welcome O.
A lawyer referral service thinks so and the company has videotaped him making a pitch for legal representation.
Simpson the former spokesman for Hertz and other companies said he made the appearance on behalf of Justice Media as a favor to a friend and because he believes in the rights of all defendants to have adequate legal representation.
He said he was paid only enough to cover his expenses.
Simpson said the proposal interested him because it is aimed at minority defendants.
The main thing I have learned is you can t walk into a courtroom without competent legal representation Simpson said in a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press.
The football Hall of Famer said he was grateful he had the money to hire the best lawyers in the business to represent him at his 1994 criminal trial.
He was acquitted on charges of murdering ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after a trial with a defense focused on racism and alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.
Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Ms.
Simpson and Goldman in a separate civil trial and was ordered to pay 33.
Any income he receives can be seized by the estate of Ms.
Simpson and the Goldman family to satisfy the judgment.
Some wonder if a referral from Simpson would help a lawyer s business.
The message is not bad but people may have problems with the messenger said Laurie Levenson associate dean of Loyola University Law School.
Assuming they are targeting an African American audience it s still iffy she said.
Simpson said he has been following a number of recent cases in which defendants convicted long ago were released from prison.
These people lost years of their lives Simpson said.
If any of them had the money to properly defend themselves maybe they wouldn t have had to spend any time in jail.
He acknowledged a lot of people are convinced he is guilty but said that reflects a public unwillingness to believe that police do bad things.
Asked if he has any new evidence that might help convince the public of his innocence he said I m working on it.
Simpson will keep custody of his two young children in a settlement with the parents of his slain ex wife his lawyer said Monday.
The agreement which still requires the signatures of Lou and Juditha Brown heads off a second trial over the custody of 13 year old Sydney and Justin 10.
It s in the best interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the courts any further said Simpson attorney Bernard Leckie.
The Browns have long fought Simpson over custody of the children but Leckie said Simpson is now on good terms with his children s grandparents and they re closely involved in their upbringing.
The Browns and Simpson are getting along better now Leckie said.
Reached at home Monday Simpson refused to comment.
Calls to the Browns were unreturned and their lawyer could not be located.
The lawyer representing the children also did not return calls.
The California Supreme Court ruled in February that the custody case could go back to court for a second trial because a judge had failed to hear evidence about the slayings of Simpson s former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Simpson was acquitted in criminal court but held liable for the deaths in a civil trial and ordered to pay the Browns and Goldman s family 33.
The custody agreement comes nearly five years after Ms.
Simpson and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her Brentwood home.
Simpson spent a year in jail before he was acquitted.
During that year the Browns had custody of the two children.
When Simpson was freed the children moved in with him but the Browns decided to sue for permanent custody.
A judge awarded custody to Simpson in 1996 but the Browns appealed the decision.
LOS ANGELES (AP) There is no agreement yet on the custody of O.
Simpson s younger children their grandfather said Tuesday contradicting statements from Simpson s lawyer that he would retain custody.
Lou Brown the father of Simpson s slain ex wife said Nothing has been agreed upon.
Simpson s lawyer Bernard Leckie told The Associated Press on Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
I don t know why the attorney was discussing it Brown said.
Brown s lawyer did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Brown and his wife Juditha sued for custody and lost until an appeals court interceded.
The California Supreme Court ruled in February the custody case could go back to court for another trial.
But Leckie said Monday that Simpson would keep custody of the children in a settlement with the Browns.
Sydney 13 and 10 year old Justin Simpson the children of Simpson and his slain ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson have been at the center of a custody battle between their father and their mother s parents.
Simpson s father Lou Brown insisted Tuesday that no custody agreement had been reached and was angry at Simpson s lawyer for talking about the negotiations to The Associated Press.
I don t know why the attorney was discussing it he said.
Simpson s lawyer Bernard Leckie said Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
Simpson refused to comment and seemed distressed that his lawyer was discussing the matter publicly.
Asked what was holding up resolution of the children s custody Brown said It depends on him referring to Simpson and adding.
Marjorie Fuller the attorney representing the children said Tuesday she has not been involved in the negotiations but believes an agreement is close.
But as far as I know everybody s been working real hard on an agreement and it was waiting to be signed.
The Brown family lawyer Kimberly Knill did not return a phone call.
The children who live with Simpson often visit Brown and his wife Juditha.
The Browns lost their first custody suit but the California Supreme Court ruled in February the case could be retried.
Leckie said Monday that everyone agreed it s in the best interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the courts any further.
But he was held liable in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Brown and Goldman families who were awarded 33.
LOS ANGELES (AP) Nicole Brown Simpson s sister and her lawyer said Monday they are asking the state attorney general to investigate the possibility of filing perjury charges against O.
Simpson before a statute of limitations runs out in three months.
Denise Brown and attorney Gloria Allred said Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti has taken no action on similar requests made to him.
Allred and Brown said that Simpson lied during his civil trial when he testified that he never hit struck slapped or kicked his late wife.
District Attorney s spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin would say only that the matter is still under investigation.
In the civil trial Simpson was held liable for the 1994 deaths of Ms.
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and was ordered to pay 33.
In an earlier criminal trial he was acquitted of murder.
Simpson s ex wife and a man were stabbed to death the football star underwent a polygraph test that F.
Lee Bailey says he stopped because it was not going well.
Bailey said Friday during testimony in a Florida courtroom where his license to practice law is being challenged that shortly after the June 1994 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman he received a telephone call from Los Angeles defense attorney Robert Shapiro.
Bailey who has said he is an expert on polygraph examinations said Shapiro wanted his advice about a polygraph test of Simpson in progress that was not going well.
Bailey said he told Shapiro that was because it was too emotional a time for Simpson.
I said shut the test down you have to let him settle down said Bailey who was eventually part of Simpson s legal team.
Bailey said he advised Shapiro that if Simpson was to take a polygraph examination it should only include questions about Goldman s death.
Bailey said Shapiro took the test results and no one has seen them since.
He said Shapiro has said he doesn t have the test results.
Messages left for Shapiro Sunday afternoon were not immediately returned.
Simpson has said he never took a polygraph test but was hooked up to the machine to see how it worked.
In the civil case against Simpson lawyers for the Goldman family alleged that Simpson failed a polygraph test shortly after the slayings.
Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the deaths but the civil jury found him liable for the crimes.
The accounting of the polygraph incident in the Simpson case came in Bailey s lengthy accounting of how his time was spent defending another client international drug trafficker Claude Duboc.
Bailey is accused of misappropriating millions of dollars of stock Duboc held in a pharmaceutical company to pay Bailey s legal expenses.
Simpson will take a lie detector test if someone puts up a 3 million reward to catch his ex wife s killer defense attorney F.
Lee Bailey announced on CNN s Larry King Live Wednesday night.
If Simpson passes the test the reward money would be put in a trust fund and paid out for information about the crime.
If he fails the letter of credit pledging the money will be dissolved Bailey said.
It ll be publicly seen win lose or draw said the famed defense attorney who represented Simpson at his trial.
He s trying to get enough money out there to smoke someone out Bailey told King from West Palm Beach Fla.
On Monday the former football player told The Associated Press that he never has taken a lie detector test but was hooked up briefly to a polygraph machine to see how it worked.
Bailey on Friday had said during a Florida hearing where his license to practice law is being challenged that he suggested Simpson be stopped from completing a lie detector test after the slayings.
Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
However he was found liable for their wrongful deaths in a subsequent civil trial and was ordered to pay the victims families 33.
King also had Goldman s father Fred Goldman on the program.
Goldman said he hopes no one is stupid enough to give money.
Simpson will go on the Internet next week to field questions from the public and try once again to convince America that he didn t kill his ex wife and her friend.
I m not opposed to talking to the public about my case he said Tuesday.
My guilt was established in the public eye not in the courtroom.
It was established in the media Simpson said in a phone interview from Florida which will soon be his new home.
He said he plans to lease a house in the Miami area where he will live with his two younger children.
Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was found liable for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial and was ordered to pay the victims families 33.
He said his two hour stint on the Internet on July 27 will take place in Tampa the headquarters of Entertainment Network Inc.
He said he will receive no payment for his participation except a pledge from the company to contribute money to his three favorite charities.
Those who sign on to his chat room will pay a fee to talk with him.
Simpson said he didn t know how much it would cost to log on how much was going to charity or the address for the Web chat.
He said those with the right computer equipment will be able to see and hear him.
Others will receive answers typed in by a stenographer present in the room with him.
Simpson said the company sponsoring the two hour chat has become known for its voyeuristic Web sites in which people can look in on places such as college dorms.
He expects that some will sign on just to berate him but said he s become used to that and is confident he can get people to listen to his side of the story.
Simpson who insists he is innocent said he still receives tips about possible leads in the case and hopes the Internet site may attract people with helpful information.
As for his move to Florida he said he had wanted to move there for the past 10 years even before his ex wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman were slain in June 1994.
Had it not been for a prolonged custody battle over his children he said he would have relocated earlier.
Simpson will appear on a series of television programs next week including Today on NBC and The View on ABC to publicize a Web site on which he will take questions from the public.
The interviews will be rare television appearances for Simpson who in the years since his acquittal on murder charges in 1994 has been extensively interviewed only on Black Entertainment Television in 1996 and on ESPN in 1998.
On Tuesday Simpson will be interviewed on Today by the anchor Matt Lauer.
On Wednesday he will appear on the ABC daytime program The View talking mainly with Barbara Walters and Star Jones.
Later on Wednesday he will be seen in an afternoon segment on the Fox News Channel and that night he will appear on the same channel on the program The Edge with Paula Zahn.
In all the appearances Simpson will discuss the start up of the Web site AskOJ.
com established by the Entertainment Network a company that operates adult oriented Web sites.
Internet users who will be able to direct questions to him will be charged a 9.
95 fee to register for the site said Brian Barry a spokesman for the company and Simpson.
will be donating all his potential earnings from the Web site to charity Barry said but he did not provide details of the financial arrangement.
Jeff Zucker the executive producer of Today said Simpson was doing the interviews to publicize the start of this Web site.
But both Zucker and Bill Geddie the executive producer of The View said no conditions had been placed on the interviews.
Zucker said Lauer would ask the questions you d expect him to be asked.
Simpson lost a civil lawsuit over the deaths of his wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman in 1997.
He was ordered to pay Simpson s and Goldman s families financial judgments totaling 33.
Geddie emphasized that The View is an opinion program and said The image of O.
sitting in the center of our panel of women was too powerful to resist.
He added I think he knows he s going to be sitting with people who believe he s a murderer.
Zucker said he expected some viewers to be unhappy that Today was giving Simpson a forum to discuss his Web site but said It s certainly a newsworthy interview.
Geddie said Simpson had originally contacted Walters about doing an interview for her ABC News program 20 20 but said Barbara did not want to interview him on that show.
Geddie added that the scheduled NBC appearance influenced his decision to book the interview.
I don t know if we would have gone out on a limb to be the first to put him on.
Barry said the Entertainment Network was based in Tampa Fla.
He described it as a company that creates voyeuristic Web sites.
NEW YORK (AP) Loud cheers from a studio audience greeted Barbara Walters announcement Monday that she has canceled a scheduled appearance by O.
Simpson this week on her syndicated talk show The View.
Several viewers members of the show s production staff and all four of her co hosts had told her they were uncomfortable having Simpson as a guest she said.
Simpson s appearance scheduled for Wednesday was to promote his participation in a two hour Internet chat session on Thursday where members of the public can pay a fee to ask him questions.
Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was found liable in a subsequent civil trial for the 1994 deaths of his ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Walters said she and her co executive producer Bill Geddie made the decision to cancel the booking.
Although on The View Bill Geddie and I encourage differences of opinion among us we can t stop it and indeed we love it there was more serious concern about having Mr.
She was surrounded by her co hosts Meredith Vieira Joy Behar Star Jones and Lisa Ling.
Vieira joined in the audience s cheers by pounding the table after Walters announcement.
As Johnnie Cochran says if the guy s a schnook you must unbook.
Simpson is making other television appearances ahead of his Internet chat session including interviews Tuesday on NBC s Today and with Paula Zahn on Fox News Channel.
A Fox News Channel spokesman said Simpson s representatives asked to see questions they would be asked on the show in advance but were refused.
Goldman s father Fred went on Fox News Channel last week to encourage television networks not to have Simpson as a guest.
UNDATED Say two little letters get a big response everything from anger that O.
Simpson remains in the public eye to pride that the justice system finally worked for a black man.
Why is it that six years after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman nearly five years after O.
Just this week he s sparked controversy by appearing on the Today show to promote his latest venture (www.
com) and by not being a guest on The View after fans of that talk show protested his scheduled appearance.
They yawn when I bring it up said Frankie Bailey a University of Albany specialist in media and criminal justice in popular culture.
People may just be dragged along behind the media.
I don t think the case will ever be NOT interesting said Hunt director of African American studies and an associate sociology professor at University of Southern California.
To Joshua Meyrowitz professor of communication at the University of New Hampshire it s shortcut journalism.
and others like JonBenet Ramsey and Elian Gonzalez keep popping up.
He added It s not so much (that) the public is interested it s that journalists and journalistic institutions have figured out how simple it is to report these cases.
Meanwhile on the World Wide Web the 645 members of one O.

They even have labels for their split the No J s and the Pro J s.
The 1 272 topics include everything from the gruesome ( Nicole whose trachea was severed did not even aspirate a single drop of blood.

) One member is Betty Parker 60 a General Motors retiree in Trenton N.
She s pondered or researched or written on or read about the case from Day One she said and continues to do so.
But I started watching and I found myself thinking That s strange about so many details.
If he was in a life and death struggle he would have practically sliced it off but it was just a tiny cut.
For Parker such nagging questions never have been answered and in their wake is a different America.
As an African American I feel my people are being punished for taking this (innocent) position she said.
There are people in board rooms making decisions who are still embittered over the O.
News Rituals in the Construction of Reality agreed that race is a prime reason why Simpson remains a flash point.
I think the case might be seen as a giant Rorschach test he said.
The trials forced America to consider three hot button topics simultaneously Hunt said.
Race as Simpson is black and Nicole was white.
And class with his wealth enabling Simpson to hire a dream team of attorneys.
just never comes up said Bailey from the University of Albany.
I think by this time most people have reached their own conclusions about the case.
As an academic I ll be interested to see how many hits he gets on his new Web site.
Simpson wants to stop an upcoming television miniseries about the defense in his murder case saying its purported revelations are the product of a lawyer s breach of legal confidentiality and an author s breach of promise.
Simpson filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against his former friend and lawyer Robert Kardashian and author Lawrence Schiller whose 1996 book American Tragedy.
The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense is the basis of the series now being filmed for CBS Television for airing in November.
Judge David Yaffe declined to issue a restraining order that would have immediately barred Schiller from working on the miniseries but scheduled a hearing Sept.
6 on a request for a preliminary injunction that would accomplish the same purpose.
The suit also seeks return of any profits Schiller and Kardashian made by violating Simpson s rights.
This action is about the avaricious disregard of the attorney client relationship and of promises of confidentiality by an attorney and a writer who value the fame and fortune to be derived from publishing information about a sensational trial more than adhering to their ethical obligations and contractual agreements Terry Gross a lawyer representing Simpson said in court papers.
Gross alleged that Schiller had gained the cooperation of Simpson and eight of his lawyers for the book project by promising falsely that Simpson would be allowed to review the manuscript before publication and remove any confidential material.
The lawsuit also accused Kardashian a member of Simpson s defense team of divulging conversations and defense secrets to Schiller in violation of a lawyer s legal duty to keep confidential all information learned during the attorney client relationship.
Schiller who wrote the book with journalist James Willwerth initially described Kardashian as co author and wound up paying him a fee the lawsuit said.
The State Bar last month said it had privately reprimanded Kardashian for professional misconduct and ordered him with his agreement not to practice law for two years.
The disciplinary action was in response to Simpson s allegations his lawyers said.
In reply to the lawsuit Schiller and Kardashian denied making any promises to Simpson about the book or miniseries and also said Simpson should have sued before the book was published in 1996.
Gross said Simpson had not sued then because he was tied up in a civil damage suit.
Gross also said the miniseries had large amounts of confidential information that was not in the book.
Schiller who is directing the TV production said the content was virtually the same.
A Los Angeles jury acquitted Simpson in 1995 of murdering his ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
A civil jury in Orange County however later found the former football star responsible for their deaths in a suit by the victims families.
One of the last scenes of Schiller s book portrays Kardashian Simpson s longtime friend as doubting his innocence despite the acquittal.
Simpson s children have enrolled in an exclusive South Florida private school and he asked the media to leave them alone.
Standing on the driveway of Gulliver Academy Simpson said Thursday he s proud that his 14 year old daughter Sydney and 12 year old son Justin passed the school s rigorous entrance exams and are beginning classes.
The academy charges 13 000 annually has an average class size of 14 students and sends almost all of its graduates to college.
Jeb Bush and singers Julio Iglesias and Gloria Estefan have attended the school.
My major concern was the education of my kids Simpson said.
The two key things to raising kids is to make sure that they know they are loved and make sure that they got a first class education.
Simpson 53 has had custody of his children for four years since shortly after he was acquitted of murdering their mother his ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
A civil jury later found him responsible for their 1994 deaths awarding their families 33.
Simpson said he s in the middle of moving from Los Angeles to South Florida renting a house for now in an undisclosed location.
LOS ANGELES (AP) Six years ago this summer O.
Simpson was a defendant in the most watched murder case in American history.
Viewers sat glued to their TV sets as the saga unfolded in what would be dubbed the Trial of the Century.
Now a TV miniseries is reproducing the experience and exposing audiences to what they didn t see during the yearlong trial.
behind the scenes battles and strategy sessions by the defense dream team which won Simpson s acquittal.
Simpson sent his lawyers to court this month seeking a preliminary injunction to halt production on American Tragedy.
So far his 11th hour legal bid has been futile.
A judge refused to issue an injunction saying he d look at the script and revisit the matter.
With luck production will be completed by the time Simpson s suit gets back to court on Sept.
A visit to the soundstage in North Hollywood is an adventure in deja vu.
Actors bear an eerie resemblance to Marcia Clark Robert Shapiro and Superior Court Judge Lance Ito among others.
The courtroom where the case was tried has been duplicated in every detail including floral arrangements that often decorated the judge s bench.
The guiding hand behind the production is Lawrence Schiller who wrote the book American Tragedy with James Willwerth based on information from his mole on the defense team lawyer Robert Kardashian.
Schiller is directing from a script written by Pulitzer Prize winner Norman Mailer and he has assembled a top notch cast headed by Ving Rhames as Johnnie Cochran Jr.
Lee Bailey and Ron Silver as Robert Shapiro.
Schiller who collaborated with Simpson on a jailhouse book I Want to Tell You recently directed another miniseries from his book Perfect Murder Perfect Town a recounting of the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case.
The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense published in 1996 was controversial from the start.
Lawyers felt it invaded Simpson s attorney client privilege of confidentiality.
Eight members of the defense filed affidavits last week saying they had been misled into giving interviews to Schiller.
But the author s lawyers pointed out that no one took legal action until the miniseries was nearly completed.
Schiller says neither Simpson nor anyone else was promised prior approval on the book or script.
Cochran and Shapiro have met with the actors portraying them he said.
The public doesn t know what took place behind closed doors how the defense dealt with the evidence how they pushed the envelope in the court system.
Although a Simpson body double sits at the counsel table during filming of court sessions his is not a speaking role.
A Simpson voice is occasionally heard on an intercom talking to his lawyers during their meetings.
Segments of actual trial footage will be seen in the miniseries.
The actors have spent many hours immersing themselves in trial history reading books and watching hours of trial videotape.
It was the hottest show in town said Plummer.
But the actor who recently played Mike Wallace in the movie the Insider said the chance to play the legendary F.
Lee Bailey was irresistible and he found the miniseries much more than a ghastly replay of the trial.
It s about the defense team and the quite amazing ego challenges involved he said.
The challenges of playing Bailey included a physical transformation for Plummer whose body was padded and his face altered by a rubber mask.
He represents the high flown old school of lawyering the old man the curmudgeon.
Ron Silver who bears a striking resemblance to Shapiro added thick eyebrows and shaved a bald spot on the back of his head.
Silver has met with Shapiro more than once but said the lawyer claims never to have read Schiller s book.
I ve read Bob s book and I ve talked to other people about him said Silver who concluded that Shapiro laid the groundwork for a brilliant defense but was forced to the sidelines by others.
Once the trial started he became quite marginalized said Silver.
If the movie hews to the book it will not take a position on whether Simpson was truly innocent of the murders of his ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Simpson was acquitted in criminal court and later found liable in civil court.
I don t know what the truth is both Plummer and Silver said separately.
But one cast member said he became convinced that truth was never the aim.
This thing about the search for the truth is laughable said Bruno Kirby who plays attorney Barry Scheck.
I hope this (movie) makes people look at the system and see that it needs work.
Entertainment Television s second original TV movie takes a comic look at a struggling actor who discovers a formula for success being a heel and then learns success isn t all it s cracked up to be.
31 stars Harland Williams Robert Wagner and Elizabeth Berkley.
Bob Saget who directed makes a cameo appearance.
Simpson has lost a bid to block broadcast of a TV miniseries he claims would reveal his defense team secrets to an audience of millions.
After reading the script Superior Court Judge David Yaffe refused to issue a preliminary injunction Wednesday.
The judge said he was unconvinced the broadcast of American Tragedy would harm Simpson because most of the material already appeared in the 1996 best selling book on which it is based.
There s just no necessity for an injunction the judge said noting that Simpson can collect damages later if he wins his lawsuit claiming Lawrence Schiller who co wrote the book and directed the miniseries and Robert Kardashian Simpson s former defense lawyer violated privacy contracts and published confidential material.
We re very pleased of course said Gary Bostwick a lawyer representing Project 95 the movie s producer and Schiller.
Simpson lawyer Terry Gross of San Francisco said an appeal was being considered.
However both sides admit they are unlikely to get an appeal judgment before the miniseries Nov.
Like the book the miniseries focuses on the tensions and strategies of the legal dream team that won Simpson s acquittal in the 1994 slayings of his ex wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Simpson was found liable for the killings in a later civil trial and ordered to pay 33.
