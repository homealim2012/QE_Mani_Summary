19980615233000000	Work begins on Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade. SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Construction of Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade was under way Tuesday, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest. 	   A single bulldozer entered the Jabiluka mining lease in northern Australia late Monday and began clearing the site ahead of actual construction, miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. said. 	   Chief executive Phillip Shirvington said construction of the mine will take up to 18 months. 	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world. 	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market. 	   Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable uranium reserves, but only about 14 percent of the world market because of a previous government's restriction on the number of uranium mines. 	   The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia. 	   Work began on site despite the company not having final approval for its preferred plan for the project. 	   The company wants to truck uranium ore from Jabiluka to its existing mine and plant at Ranger, about 13 miles (20 kms) away, for processing. The plan has been approved by government but is opposed by key Aboriginal landowners, who don't want Jabiluka to proceed. 	   A more expensive option is building processing facilities at Jabiluka. ERA has a 1983 agreement signed by the landowners approving this plan, but does not have environmental approvals from the federal government. 	   Landowners have disputed the 1983 agreement and their attempts to have the mining lease declared invalid have failed in the courts. 	   Shirvington said Tuesday the contractor currently working on the site agreed to work for ERA after protesters blockading the site chained themselves to his truck as he was trying to reach a different job. 	   ``He was pretty angry, we saw the opportunity and negotiated with him to start working for us; he agreed and started straight away,'' Shirvington said. ``The protesters delivered him right into our hands.'' 	   Kate Lecchi, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said they didn't believe the contractor was not going to work on the Jabiluka site, and that demonstrators will continue to try to stop construction. 	   ``We believe that because of our actions ERA is a year behind schedule on this mine and we hope to delay them even more,'' she said from the protest site, about 220 miles (350 kms) from Darwin.

19980703045800000	More than 100 arrested in protest at uranium mine site. DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ More than 100 protesters were arrested Friday after overwhelming police and storming onto the site of a proposed new uranium mine in Australia's north, police said. 	   About 300 protesters walked from a camp set up in March by anti-uranium groups protesting Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s planned mine on the Jabiluka mineral lease, about 190 miles (300 kms) east of Darwin. 	   About 180 protesters climbed a security fence and walked onto the construction site, said spokeswoman Megan Kinninment. 	   ``They were reclaiming the lease for the traditional Aboriginal owners of this land, the Mirrar people, who have been opposed to this mine from the start,'' she said. 	   Police Superintendent Gary Smith said dozens of protesters stampeded over police on their way to the site, elbowing officers out of the way. Police were considering laying assault charges against the demonstrators. 	   Construction of the Jabiluka mine _ Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade _ began in June, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest. 	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world. 	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market. 	   Almost 100 arrested protesters had been taken to Darwin because the jail at the nearby town of Jabiru was not big enough, Smith said.
19980714002900000	112 uranium mine protesters arrested at Jabiluka. CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory. 	   The 112 were among 130 who entered a machinery compound at dawn, according to a statement issued by the protesters. Of these 130, 20 ``locked on'' to machinery in the compound. 	   The protesters, who have been campaigning at the site since March, want development of the Jabiluka mine stopped. 	   The arrests Tuesday bring the total since the protest action began to about 350. 	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide in ore at Jabiluka and plans to mine the deposit over 30 years. 	   The company already mines uranium ore at the nearby Ranger mine. 	   Philip Shirvington, ERA's chief executive, has said independent scientific studies have found no adverse impact on the environment from uranium mining at Ranger.

DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ An old car dressed up to look like a frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park on Friday. 	   A dozen protesters opposed to the uranium mine chained themselves to the car-lizard about 4 a.m., according to blockade spokeswoman Kerry Nettle. 	   She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore over 28 years. 	   Mine builder Energy Resources of Australia has denied the mine, which it says will inject 6.2 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion) into the Australian economy, will have any adverse impact on Kakadu. 	   Senior Police Sgt. Alan Thomson of the nearby Jabiru police said the protesters locked on to the car will be removed by police. 	   Thomson said the car looked like a lizard ``with the help of a lot of imagination.'' 	   Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley confirmed Thursday that the Labor Party would stop Jabiluka being built if it won government at the Oct. 3 national election. 	   pjs
19980921010600000	Firebomb attack carried out on Australia's Jabiluka mine company. DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A firebomb attack caused more than 100,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 60,000) damage Monday to a Darwin office of the company building the controversial Jabiluka uranium mine. 	   Four gasoline-filled beer bottles were thrown at the Energy Resources of Australia office between 1:45 and 2 a.m., a police spokeswoman said. 	   One went through a window while the remaining three were found outside the office, which houses ERA's environment monitoring division. 	   The fire caused more than 100,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 60,000) damage to the office's front room and computer equipment, ERA's principal environmental engineer, Mark Daniell said. 	   Police have not yet said if they suspect a link between the attack and recent demonstrations throughout Australia against ERA's planned uranium mine in an area surrounded by Kakadu National Park. The mine is opposed by the area's traditional owners and environmentalists. 	   Anti-uranium protesters distanced themselves from the Darwin attack. 	   ``We are a peaceful protest. This was not endorsed in any way by the protesters. We strongly disapprove of these types of tactics,'' said Sarojani Krishnapillai, a spokeswoman for the protesters. 	   In another incident Monday, a man chained himself to the office of a rural National Party member of Parliament and threatened to blow himself up if the government did not change its policy on uranium mining at Jabiluka. 	   The siege ended safely more than four hours later when police overpowered the 50-year-old man. 	   The Jabiluka mine, which is expected to dig up almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore in 28 years, is supported by the current conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard. 	   But it is opposed by Labor, which says it will stop the project it it wins government and there are no legally enforceable contracts in place.
19981015094900000	Anti-uranium protesters thrown out of miner's annual meeting. SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A rowdy group of protesters was ejected from uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s annual general meeting Thursday after interrupting chairman Campbell Anderson's address. 	   Those ejected, members of an environmental group called the Wilderness Society, had been protesting against the company's Jabiluka mine development in the Northern Territory. 	   The demonstrators had bought shares in ERA, a subsidiary of North Ltd., to gain entry to the meeting. 	   Most of those ejected by security guards were young women who were carried out of the meeting still screaming. 	   During the melee, one protester cried out: ``Don't you care about our children?'' 	   ``Hopefully you won't have any,'' Anderson replied. 	   Protesters also repeatedly asked the board questions about environmental risks of the proposed mine. 	   Construction has begun at Jabiluka, where ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide, making it one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world. 	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (6.2 billion Australian dollars) to Australia's gross domestic product over about 30 years, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
19981026001900000	U.N. team investigates claims uranium mine threatens park. DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A high-level United Nations delegation on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique cultural and environmental values. 	   An eight-member team from the U.N.'s World Heritage Bureau will visit environmental and Aboriginal cultural sites and speak to interest groups including the company building the mine, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.. 	   The team will report to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan, in December where it will recommend whether to place the park on a list of endangered world heritage sites. 	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq. kms) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-km) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species including many that are rare or endangered. 	   It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites. 	   The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed for both its environmental and cultural values. Thousands of tourists visit the park every year. 	   ERA has government approval to build a uranium mine at its Jabiluka lease within the park's boundaries, near a uranium mine it already operates inside the park. The company says its good environmental record at the existing Ranger mine shows the Jabiluka project poses no threat. 	   Environmental groups and the Mirrar Aborigines of the region claim it will cause environmental damage. 	   U.N. team leader Prof. Francesco Francioni said its findings will not be binding on the Australian government, even if the team considers the park is under threat. 	   However, he said governments can be embarrassed into protecting sites listed by the bureau as endangered. 	   ``The continuing value of Kakadu National Park is something that concerns the whole world, the whole of humanity and therefore justifies such interest,'' Francioni said. 	   Two parks are currently on the endangered list _ Yellowstone in the United States and the Galapagos Islands.
19981027062100000	Mining is destroying Aborigines' culture, representatives claim. JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government has mounted a systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living in Kakadu National Park, a U.N. team investigating whether uranium mining threatens the park was told Tuesday. 	   The 27-member Aboriginal Mirrar clan strongly opposed the building of the Jabiluka uranium mine on its traditional land, in an area surrounded by Kakadu. 	   ``The Australian government has mounted a systematic and sustained attack on the living tradition of the Mirrar and Aboriginal people of Kakadu,'' Mirrar spokeswoman Jacqui Katona told the U.N. delegation. 	   ``This attack on the political and social structures of Aboriginal people has manifested itself in the form of massive industrial development associated with uranium mining,'' Katona said. 	   ``The Mirrar believe that the Australian government supports mining at the expense of their very existence.'' 	   She urged the U.N. group to put Kakadu on the list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger. 	   The team from the U.N. World Heritage Bureau is visiting the park to examine claims that the environmental and cultural values of the park are being threatened by the Jabiluka mine. 	   It will meet with mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. and government representatives later this week. 	   The team will report in December to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan, where it will recommend whether to place the park on a list of endangered world heritage sites. 	   If Kakadu is put on the ``in danger'' list _ joining the likes of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, the war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of Mali _ the value of the park as a tourist attraction would be reduced, Katona said. 	   Such a decision would prove a major international embarrassment to the government of Prime Minister John Howard, which has maintained that the removal of 20 million metric tons of radioactive uranium ore over 28 years will not harm Kakadu. 	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered. 	   It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites.

19981028035900000	Uranium mine may threaten archaeological sites, U.N. delegations. JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ Archaeological sites that show humans lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a high-level U.N. committee was told Wednesday. 	   The Australian branch of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the impact on archaeological and rock art sites in the region of the mine had not been properly assessed. 	   In a submission to the U.N. team, which is investigating whether the mine threatens the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, the council said it was particularly concerned about the Malakunanja 2 archaeological site, just 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) from the mine entrance. 	   ``Malakunanja 2 is acknowledged as currently offering the oldest dated evidence of human occupation in Australia, dating some 50,000-60,000 years ago based on thermoluminescence dating of buried sands,'' the submission said. 	   The council was ``not convinced that the archaeological evidence of Malakunanja 2 will retain its integrity given the pressures of the proposed mine.'' 	   Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. has begun construction of the Jabiluka mine, which lies on a lease within the boundaries of Kakadu but technically not part of the park. Environmental groups and local Aborigines oppose the mine. 	   ``It is not certain what impacts noise, vibration, dust and changes to the water table might have on the natural processes of deterioration (of the site) and whether any acceleration of deterioration will occur,'' the council said. 	   It called on the delegation to declare Kakadu a world heritage area that is ``in danger'' unless Jabiluka is stopped. 	   The delegation will recommend whether to list Kakadu as the 26th ``in danger'' site of the 552 sites recognized by the United Nations' World Heritage Bureau for environmental and cultural values. The decision will be made at the bureau's meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December. 	   ERA and Australia's government claim Jabiluka will not hurt the park. 	   If listed as in danger, Kakadu would join the likes of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, and the war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of Mali. 	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.

19981125021800000	U.N. panel says uranium mine should be stopped. CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A United Nations World Heritage committee called Wednesday for the scrapping of the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory. 	   The committee said the proposed mine would pose a severe danger to the cultural and natural values of the adjacent Kakadu National Park. 	   ``The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed,'' the committee said in its report following a visit to Kakadu last month. 	   However, federal Environment Minister Robert Hill has blasted the report as biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity. 	   ``I am disturbed and distressed about the quality of this document,'' Hill said. ``There has not been a case developed that could, in any way, lead to the conclusion they have reached.'' 	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered. 	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year. 	   The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the environment. 	   ``The mission has noted severe ascertained and potential dangers to the cultural and natural values of the Kakadu National Park, posed primarily by the proposal for uranium mining and milling at Jabiluka,'' it said. 	   The miner, Energy Resources of Australia Limited, told the panel that its project does not threaten the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, which are recognized by the United Nations' World Heritage Bureau. 	   The company has already begun construction of its Jabiluka uranium mine, which is within the boundaries, but technically not part of Kakadu. 	   The ERA also promised it would rehabilitate the site ``to a condition ecologically and culturally compatible with Kakadu.''
19981128235200000	UN gives government a reprieve. DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine. 	   At its meeting in Kyoto, Japan, UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau on Saturday night expressed ``grave concerns'' about the impact Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's cultural and natural world values. 	   But after intensive lobbying from the Australian government, the bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger. 	   Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed report by April 15 next year saying what had been done to ``prevent further damage and to mitigate all the threats'' to the park posed by Jabiluka.'' 	   The bureau said that if the report did not show that the threats posed by Jabiluka had been properly dealt with, Kakadu should immediately be put on the in danger list, joining other areas such as the war-torn old city of Jerusalem. 	   Last Wednesday, the committee called for the scrapping of the mine. 	   Federal Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity. And while the report was thought to be an embarrassment to the Australian government, Hill stressed that the committee's findings had no legal standing and that construction of the mine would not stop.

19981201064100000	Australia defies UN by giving uranium project green light. CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park. 	   The U.N. Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization did accept a plea from the Australian government that it be given six months to respond to the panel's ruling. 	   But the panel recommended that all mining activities should cease in the meantime. It said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the environment. 	   The local Mirrar Aboriginal people have been among the most vocal critics of the project, which although actually inside the Northern Territory national park, has been technically excluded as an enclave within it. 	   Environment Minister Robert Hill said he would compile a comprehensive rebuttal of the UNESCO report, which he has described as superficial and unbalanced. 	   But he would not tell uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia, which is still 18 months away from mining the first uranium and is still doing preparatory work, to comply with the UNESCO call. 	   ``We are quite satisfied with all the Australian processes for approval of the mine,'' Hill said. 	   ``The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural damage,'' Hill said. 	   Hill said UNESCO's report, made after only a four-day visit to the mine site, ignored the enormous body of evidence gathered over 18 years of mining at Ranger just 12 miles (20 km) from Jabiluka. 	   Australia's environmental groups reacted immediately to Hill's announcement saying it would seriously damage Australia's reputation. 	   Greens party Senator Bob Brown said, ``Even major uranium buyers like France, Japan and the U.S. -- members of the World Heritage Committee -- voted to stop this obscene mine.'' 	   ``If Australia defies the world umpire on the World Heritage Convention no treaty will be seen as safe,'' Brown added. 	   Environmentalists say reputable surveys show that 82 percent of Australians oppose mining in areas like Kakadu. 	   They claim that the government's rebuttal of the UNESCO report shows it to be both arrogant and out of touch with its own people and the rest of the world. 	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,200 sq. km.) of flood plains and plateau on Australia's north coast, with waterfalls and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.

19990419035521000	Rain Forest Advocate Wins Award. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian  uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize. The $125,000 annuall prizes, to be awarded today, recognize  efforts of grassroots environmentalism around the world. ``The common theme as always is that one person can indeed make  a difference,'' said Duane Silverstein, who oversees the awards. ``You don't need a special education, special training or a special background to help save the earth.'' The labors of Jacqui Katona and Yvonne Margarula have delayed  mining of an estimated 20,000 tons of ore from Jabiluka, one of the world's richest untapped uranium bodies. The government-approved mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu National Park. Last year Katona and Margarula were convicted of trespassing  following a protest against the mine. Later, Katona urged a United Nations panel to halt the mine operation, saying it amounted to an attack on the Mirrar, an Aboriginal clan that has cherished the land for centuries. Samuel Nguiffo of Cameroon also won the prize for leading a team  in the Congo Basin which informs forest dwellers of a law that allows inhabitants to manage lands prized by foreign logging companies. ``It is unacceptable that the basis for life of millions of  individuals be destroyed in order to satisfy the greed of a few private companies,'' Nguiffo said. Some 20 million to 30 million people live in or near the central  African rain forest, which is second in size only to the Amazon forest in South America. Other recipients of the 10th annual Goldman awards were: -- Ka Hsaw Wa, a member of the Karen ethnic minority in Burma,  now known as Myanmar. He fled his home during military rule 10 years ago. He has interviewed more than 1,000 victims of human rights abuses and documented environmental abuses, including increased logging and the hunting of elephants and tigers. -- Bernard Martin, a former fisherman from Newfoundland who has  called for reduced fishing quotas after witnessing the collapse of Canada's east coast fisheries. -- Jorge Varela, a conservationist who has worked to contain the  expansion of shrimp farming along the Gulf of Fonseca in Honduras. Environmentalists say shrimp farming has destroyed critical coastal wetlands, displaced traditional fishing communities and contaminated fresh water supplies. -- Michal Kravcik, a Slovakian hydrologist who galvanized support  to stop a proposed dam that would have destroyed the environment and forced the evacuation of four 700-year-old villages.

19971008000000000	Australia Okays Controversial Uranium Mining Plan. CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government today gave the green light to the country's controversial uranium mining plan, arguing that it would generate billions of U.S. dollars in revenue for Australians and create 2,000 jobs. Australian Prime Minister John Howard today defended the government's decision to go ahead with uranium mining on development and environmental grounds. The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory. "There is no reason, therefore, why it should not go ahead," Howard was quoted today by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation evening TV news program as saying. Resources Minister Warwick Parer said estimates indicated the Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could provide more than 90,400 tons of uranium oxide. In a move apparently to lobby domestic support for the decision, the minister made it clear that the government is looking to Jabiluka's export potential rather than uranium for domestic use. "Jabiluka means Australia could become the leading world uranium oxide supplier," Parer said in a statement. He told reporters that exports from Jabiluka are expected to peak at 4,500 tons a year and the mine is expected to add a total of 4.46 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's gross domestic product over 28 years. The government's decision however has been condemned by environmentalists and opposition parties. "It is a dark day for Australia when our most precious World Heritage area is consigned as a 60 million ton radioactive waste dump," Wilderness Society national spokesperson Virginia Young said. Australian Democrats environment spokeswoman Meg Lees said the government has ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area and environmental concerns.

The Age -- Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday.
19981125000000000	Australia Faces Embarrassment Over Uranium Mine. CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia faces international embarrassment over the Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N. committee Wednesday demanding the mine be scrapped to prevent it endangering the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area. In a major embarrassment to the Howard government, the Bureau of the U.N. World Heritage Committee found Kakadu was under threat, raising the prospect that the committee will this week make Kakadu only the 26th of the world's 552 World Heritage Sites to be placed on its endangered list. "The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger," the bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu (National Park in Northern Territory) was under threat from Jabiluka. "The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed." The finding was hailed by traditional owners and green groups as a great victory, but Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead, according to Australian Associated Press. Hill denounced the report as biased and unscientific and said Australia would try to have it struck down before it is considered by the World Heritage Committee in Kyoto this week. He said he was astonished the report could call for the scrapping of Jabiluka because of its perceived threat to Kakadu, but did not object to the nearby Ranger mine, which had been operating for 18 years. Northern Territory Chief Minister Shane Stone also accused the report's authors of predetermining their findings.
19981127000000000	World Heritage Chief Rejects Australia's Criticism. CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) --The Australian government's criticism of a report on the Kakadu National Park was extraordinary, head of the World Heritage mission to Kakadu, Francesco Francioni, said Friday. The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list. Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead anyway. The report is due to go before the World Heritage Committee Bureau meeting in Kyoto. While talking over ABC Radio from Tokyo, Francioni rejected Hill's claim that the mission's report was full of contradictions. He said the recommendations were designed to remove real and potential dangers from one of Australia's most famous national parks. He said the majority of the drafting group reflected the views of the report. "I find it quite extraordinary that this language is used, especially since I personally ensured that the mission cooperated and remained open to any kind of input and any kind of interaction with the Australian government." The World Heritage convention was supposed to be an instrument of cooperation and not a forum for adversary politics, he said. The Australian government has already insisted that Jabiluka remain open, which would almost certainly see Kakadu placed on the endangered list if the World Heritage Committee accepts the report of its mission to Australia.
19981129000000000	Greens Accuses Howard Government's Standing on Kakadu. CANBERRA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Greens accused the Howard government's standing on Kakadu National Park by saying it had become the world's leading environmental pirate for its role in stopping the immediate listing of Kakadu as an endangered area. Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered. "The Howard Government has now in the space of 12 months become the leading agent in undermining world agreements and environmental conventions," Brown was quoted by Australian Associated Press as saying. "It has become the ace environmental pirate on the planet and Australia's international reputation is being very grievously damaged." At its meeting in Kyoto, the heritage bureau expressed "grave concerns" about the impact Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's cultural and natural values. But after intensive lobbying from the government the bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger. Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed report saying what had been done to "prevent further damage and to mitigate all the threats" to the park posed by Jabiluka. If that report was not satisfactory, the bureau said Kakadu should immediately be put on the in danger list, joining the likes of the war torn old city of Jerusalem. Brown said the delay would see Australia's reputation "dragged through the environmental and cultural fires from experts right around the globe". The bureau's recommendation would be put to the World Heritage Committee this week for a final decision. It was unlikely the committee would disagree with the bureau. "This has come out of an intense political lobby devoid of any environmental or cultural rhyme or reason by the Howard Government." Brown said he would write to the bureau to say millions of Australians, international experts and the local Aboriginal people did not agree with its decision. "You cannot proceed with building a mine without damaging the cultural and environmental values of the Jabiluka valley and therefore the world heritage area," he said.
19990415000000000	Australia Rejects UNESCO Report on Kakadu National Park. CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine. Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said scientific evidence proved the natural values of Kakadu would not be threatened by the development of the mine. Hill said the report of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage mission contained "several errors of science, law and logic". Located in the Northern Territory, northwest Australia, the Kakadu National Park covers 20,000 square km. Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to the park, but the government rejected their environmental concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the mining project is important. Hill said Australia's response to the report "clearly demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu National Park on the in-danger list". The findings of the mission report were inconsistent with the fact the Ranger uranium mine, less than 20 km from Jabiluka had operated for 20 years with no adverse impact on Kakadu. "This proves mining can occur on leases adjacent to Kakadu without harming World Heritage values," he told journalists in Canberra.
