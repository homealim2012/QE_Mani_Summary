Advocates of art and music classes in public schools insist that these subjects offer students a myriad of benefits.
In the U.S. though, where no official federal law mandates the teaching of fine arts, many programs have been marginalized or eliminated over the past 20 years because of budget constraints or cuts; more recently, efforts at meeting standardized academic testing objectives has trumped teaching the arts.
However, in 1994, the U.S. Department of Education did set improving fine arts instruction as a goal for 2000.
Yet a 1998 study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that the nation was falling short in artistic instruction.
That same year, Hillary Clinton announced the nation's commitment to putting high-quality arts education in all schools.
Progress has been slow.
In 2000, only an estimated 25% of American schools offered music programs.
Some parents have had to turn to private academies for their children's fine arts education though fund-raising drives and donations by organizations such as the nonprofit, Save the Music Foundation, combined with contributions from various philanthropic sources, has recently helped to bolster arts education in America's public schools.
In China, by contrast, The Ministry of Education has historically sought to improve the younger generation's education in the arts and has embarked on many projects towards this end.
For example, students are encouraged to attend free performances, and improvements are continually made to music and art facilities in schools.
Officials there believe these efforts help to nurture civilized manners and moral conduct.
