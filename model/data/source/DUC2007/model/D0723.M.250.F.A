Dianne Feinstein was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992 after an unsuccessful run for Governor of California in 1990.
She defeated Gov. Pete Wilson's hand-picked successor, receiving more votes than any Senate candidate in American history.
She had to run again in 1994 since she was finishing Wilson's incomplete term, and in that election she edged Rep. Huffington, who spent $30 million on the race, by 163,000 votes.
Feinstein faced reelection again in 2000 by which time her political and legislative accomplishments made her a clear favorite with polls showing her lead over Rep. Tom Campbell among decided voters as 57%-34%.
While serving in the Senate 1993-2000 Feinstein established a solid record as a seasoned politician and one of the best speakers in current American politics.
Some regard her as a centrist able to work with members of both parties, and others as generally-but not uniformly-a liberal.
She became the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology and gained a seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee.
Sen. Feinstein was the first Senate Democrat to speak out publicly condemning Pres.
Clinton's lying to the American people and she sponsored an unsuccessful censure resolution.
The crowning glories of her Senate career were the creation of a new national park in the Mojave Desert and enactment of a ban on assault weapons (1994).
As the Democratic National Convention approached in 2000 there was much speculation that Dianne Feinstein might be the Vice Presidential nominee.
