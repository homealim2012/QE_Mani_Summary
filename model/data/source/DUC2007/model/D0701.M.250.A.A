Morris Dees was co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 1971 and has served as its Chief Trial Counsel and Executive Director.
The SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups.
As early as 1973 the SPLC won a federal case which forced funeral homes throughout the U.S. to provide equal services to blacks and whites.
In 1991 it started a classroom program "Teaching Tolerance" which features books, videos, posters and a magazine that goes to more than 400,000 teachers.
It also funded a civil rights litigation program in Georgia to provide free legal assistance to poor people.
The SPLC's most outstanding successes, however, have been in its civil lawsuits against hate groups.
Dees and the SPLC have fought to break the organizations by legal action resulting in severe financial penalties.
Described as "wielding the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders," the technique has been most impressive: 1987-$7 million against the United Klans of America in Mobile, Alabama; 1989-$1 million against Klan groups in Forsyth County, Georgia; 1990-$9 million against the White Aryan Resistance in Portland, Oregon; and 1998-$20 million against The Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Charleston, South Carolina.
But despite these judgments the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan Resistance have survived.
