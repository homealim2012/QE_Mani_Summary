Potable water shortages are common in many countries of Asia and Africa and have also occurred on the island of Cyprus and in Mexico.
The cause is usually a chronic condition of limited sources of potable water to serve populated areas aggravated by equipment failures, obsolete or inadequate distribution systems, drought and inefficient, wasteful or absent water-management programs.
Damaged or obsolete distribution systems present problems in Angola, Bangladesh, China, Cyprus and Lebanon.
Inadequate distribution systems are the crux of the problem in parts of China, Ethiopia, Iran, Bangladesh, Lebanon and Nepal.
Periods of drought have worsened the situation in The Philippines, Malaysia, Cyprus, Vietnam, Tanzania, Thailand, Pakistan, Rwanda, and Afghanistan.
Cyprus relies completely on rainfall and plans desalination plants to relieve the shortage.
Waste, pollution and lack of an efficient water-management system are problems in South Africa, China, Lebanon and Mexico.
Lebanon relies on pumping stations to bring water from the coast to rural areas but is afflicted by leaky pipes and a system less efficient than reliance on dams and gravity.
Nepal presents an unusual case in having rich sources of water but no system to tap this resource and bring its treasure to the people even in its capital of Katmandu.
The biggest problem is providing limited resources of water to growing urban areas where the need is the greatest and problems of waste and pollution are the most severe.
