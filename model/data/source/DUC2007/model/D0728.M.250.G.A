The antiviral drug interferon is a genetically engineered replica of a naturally occurring human protein.
A weak angiogenesis inhibitor, interferon blocks a substance secreted by some tumors that signals the body to grow more cells.
It has been used most prominently either alone or in combination with ribavirin to treat liver disease, particularly hepatitis B and hepatitis C, but has also been effective in stopping the growth of giant-cell tumors.
Its effectiveness in reducing inflammation and quieting down overactive immune systems has helped delay the onset and slow down the progress of multiple sclerosis.
Used most extensively in the treatment of hepatitis C, interferon typically reduces symptoms of about 20% of patients if administered for six months and achieves a substantial response in as many as 30% if continued for 12-18 months.
It eliminates the disease in only 10-20% of patients and about half of those treated do not respond at all.
On the positive side, it has saved the lives of many children with life-threatening tumors called hemangiomas for which no other cancer treatment had worked.
Treatment with interferon often results in physical and emotional side effects.
Patients complain that flu symptoms, lethargy, clogged saliva glands, chronic yeast infection, urinary infection and depression can often make the treatment almost as devastating as the disease.
