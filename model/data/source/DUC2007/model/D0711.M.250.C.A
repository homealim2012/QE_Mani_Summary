On May 30, 1990 the Federal Trade Commission opened an antitrust investigation of Microsoft Corp.which was dropped in August 1993 without action.
In July 1994 Microsoft and the Department of Justice (DOJ) reached a settlement in which the company agreed to change key aspects of its licensing agreements.
In April 1995 DOJ sued to block Microsoft's acquisition of Intuit, Inc., maker of the Quicken personal finance program.
In September 1996 it was announced that DOJ was conducting an investigation of Microsoft concerning possible antitrust violations involving marketing and distribution of its Internet Explorer software.
The charges did not go to trial until October 1998.
Meanwhile antitrust suits lodged by Microsoft competitors Sun and Caldera lingered in the courts adding substance to the DOJ investigation.
By October 1999 DOJ estimated its cost for antitrust actions against Microsoft over the decade as $13.3 million.
The same month a federal judge's finding of fact ruled that Microsoft had abused its power and harmed consumers.
Settlement talks between DOJ and Microsoft ensued, but in March 2000 DOJ rejected Microsoft's offer.
Forty-eight hours later the judge in the case issued his finding of law: that Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust law through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept "an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune".
Microsoft said it would appeal.
DOJ proposed as punishment breaking Microsoft into two companies--one for Windows and one for everything else.
The judge approved the split and Microsoft said it would appeal.
