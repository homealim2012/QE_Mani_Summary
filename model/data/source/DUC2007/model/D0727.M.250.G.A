On July 29, 1999 Newt Gingrich filed for divorce from his wife of 18 years, Marianne, declaring the marriage "irretrievably broken".
Marianne filed a counterclaim asking a judge to freeze the couple's assets accusing Newt of transferring assets before filing for divorce.
Newt denied the charge but a confidential financial agreement pending a divorce settlement was reached on Sept. 10.
Marianne requested and a judge granted a videotaped deposition of a 33-year-old Congressional aide, Callista Bisek, with whom Newt was alleged to have had an affair.
Bisek appealed to another judge to overrule the decision.
Marianne then asked permission to depose Newt's close advisors and associates to get answers to questions that he ignored.
Newt responded by calling on Marianne to sit for a videotaped deposition and to account for all the couple's cash and stocks, suggesting that she had evaded their confidential financial agreement.
The agreement was subsequently released to the public.
After a judge ruled that Bisek must testify, Newt volunteered that he would question her.
Bisek admitted their six-year affair, but refused to comply when Marianne's attorney subpoenaed various gifts, letters and documents.
Outstanding legal issues were never settled since after going to mandatory mediation, the Gingriches reached "full settlement" on Dec. 16.
Final signing of the settlement on April 3, 2000 asked that the judge seal the agreement so that its terms would remain secret.
One aspect of the outcome was announced, however: Newt and Callista Bisek would be married August 18, 2000.
