Eric Robert Rudolph was charged with bombing an abortion clinic in Birmingham, AL on Jan. 29, 1998 and three earlier bombings in Atlanta, GA 1996-97.
The Birmingham bombing killed one person and injured another.
The Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta killed one and injured 111 while bombings at an Atlanta abortion clinic and a gay bar injured nine.
Pursuit of Rudolph began within hours of the Birmingham bombing.
The operation involved the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local legal authorities.
The search scoured the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina where Rudolph lived as a boy.
The area is heavily forested mountainous terrain with peaks reaching to 5000 feet, heavy hardwood forests and thickets of virtually impenetrable rhododendron.
Hundreds of mines and caves dot the area.
It was thought that Rudolph, an accomplished sportsman and survivalist, was able to hide in inaccessible mines or caves while stealing food for sustenance.
The search for Rudolph involved as many as 200 armed officers and employed bloodhounds and helicopters with infrared viewing capability.
The FBI placed Rudolph on its ten most wanted list and offered a reward of $1 million for information leading to his apprehension.
After a year without success the search was scaled back and in March 2002 it was announced that the task force would dismantle its command post in June.
In August it was reported that the 31-month unsuccessful pursuit of Rudolph had cost $24.6 million.
