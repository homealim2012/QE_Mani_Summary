Pakistan and India have failed to join the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NNPT), blaming each other and the five nuclear powers Britian, China, France, Russia and the United States for unfair and discriminatory behavior.
In accordance with the NNPT, only those five nations may maintain nuclear arsenals.
In May 1998, Pakistan conducted six underground nuclear explosions in response to five tests by India.
The tests were condemned worldwide and sanctions were imposed on both countries by the United States, Britain, Japan and other industrialized nations.
Russia did not join in the imposition of sanctions and signed a deal with India for construction of a nuclear power station in Kudankulam.
Following India's nuclear tests, Pakistani President Nawaz Sharif said that the balance of power in the region had been "violently tilted." India and Pakistan have gone to war three times since 1947, twice over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
India claimed that its nuclear tests were necessary because of threats by China over disputed territory.
Egypt called for the Middle East to be a nuclear-free region and urged Israel to join the NNPT.
Turkey and Iran called on Pakistan and India to cease nuclear testing and join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
Saudi Arabia called on India and Pakistan to show restraint; Crown Prince Abdullah recently visited a uranium enrichment plant and missile factory in Pakistan.
Japan has urged India and Pakistan to join the CTBT and has also offered both countries to conduct bilateral talks in Tokyo.
