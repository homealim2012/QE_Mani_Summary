Amnesty International (AI) monitors human rights practices throughout the world issuing specific complaints and periodic reports on governments with records of such human rights abuses as torture of prisoners, slaughter of innocent civilians or political opponents, genocide, illegal detention or violence and repression against political opposition.
It has also provided legal assistance in some cases.
The Thailand office of AI gave a human rights award to three publications and two journalists in 1998.
Targets of AI complaints claim the organization ignores efforts towards reform, exaggerates abuses by forces of law and order, interferes in internal affairs of sovereign states, supports opposition groups, and sows seeds of hatred against the government among the population.
AI charged the government of Kenya in 1997 with police torture of suspects and footdragging on promised human rights reforms.
The Kenyan government complained that AI must be sensitive to national sovereignty and the human rights of killed police officers and accused AI of inciting Kenyans against the government.
A 1998 AI report charged the Rwandan army with massacring hundreds of unarmed civilians.
Rwandan authorities countered that AI was "another hand of the insurgency" and a mouthpiece for the Hutu hardliners.
AI charges of racist acts by the German police were thoroughly investigated by German state officials in what they termed an impartial review that found that the police were not racist as a whole.
AI complaints against the Afghan Taliban in 1996 were deemed interference in the internal affairs of an Islamic state.
