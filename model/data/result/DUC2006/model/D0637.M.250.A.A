Because the sun provides clean, renewable, and decentralized power, solar energy is an important social economic asset in developing nations with a good portion of their population scattered in remote rural areas heretofore difficult to supply with traditional power.
Technology advances, cost reductions, and growing environmental concerns are also beginning to make it more attractive.
It is low polluting and reduces dependence on fossil fuels.
For the two billion people worldwide who are not connected to power lines, solar energy is often the affordable way to get electricity.
It is used extensively in Asia and Africa.
In southwest China it is widely used in telecommunication, meteorology, earthquake forecasts, and forest fire prevention.
In Europe, Netherlands, which has little space for wind turbines but lots of rooftops, uses it to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
In Latin America, Brazil and Mexico are big buyers of solar power equipment due to the large part of their populations in remote areas.
A world summit on solar energy to be held in 1996 in Harare.
Examples of cooperation between nations include Israel's working with China to reduce serious pollution by replacing chemical energy with solar energy; Israel also working with Zimbabwe, where solar energy development infrastructure is at an advanced stage; China sending solar energy equipment to Zimbabwe; Japan cooperating with China to bring solar energy to China's less-developed areas; Canada exporting its solar-energy board technology to China.
U.S. is the leading producer, with competition from Australia, Japan, Germany, and Israel.
