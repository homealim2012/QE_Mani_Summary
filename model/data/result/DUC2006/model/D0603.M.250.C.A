The Wetlands are a natural ecological system sometimes called "Earth's kidney".
Once thought to be useless mud, they are now known as important as filters for water prior to entering rivers and lakes.
They serve as a habitat for numerous varieties of flora and fauna, many of which are quite rare.
Wetlands are important for flood prevention and impact climate, water preservation, soil erosion, and pollution.
Population increase and industrialization reduce the amounts of wetland acreage.
Even in underdeveloped countries the increase of such activities as grazing, brick-making, rice-planting, hunting, and tree-cutting have negative impacts on wetlands.
The launch of Wetlands International, an international conservation body, in 1996, represents a partnership between government and non-government interests with the goal of wetlands conservation.
Efforts around the world include abuse hot lines and swamp-draining prohibitions by Uganda.
China has established wetland reserves and is developing a monitoring network and scientific study of wetlands, as well as programs at local government levels for educating the public about natural resources.
The Nethrlands and Finland are funding programs in Uganda and China respectively.
The World Bank is approving loans to Vietnam for wetlands protection and development projects.
In the U.S. the Corps of Engineers is issuing new regulations to make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands.
Several states have projects for creating manmade wetlands.
Frustrations include unspecific language in the Clean Water Act, restrictions that stifle development, concerns over property rights, budget cuts, increasing workload on Corps of Engineers, and fuzzy math.
