Wetlands, called earth's kidney, are important in filtering pollutants, regulating climate, conserving water, preventing erosion, controlling floods, and preserving biodiversity.
They can be low-cost extensions of wastewater treatment plants.
Wetlands are of vital economic importance to Asia.
Human activities threaten wetlands in many places, including Asia, Africa, and the US, where 100,000 acres per year have been lost.
The 1971 Ramsar Convention, aiming to conserve wetland habitats and enhance international cooperation, has 90 signatory countries.
In 1996 Wetlands International linked government and NGO groups to work for conservation.
Countries are raising public awareness of wetlands' importance.
In 1996 Uganda established an environmental abuse reporting hot line and banned new draining of swamps for development.
China established over 130 wetland nature reserves since 1982 and increased wetland protections.
International help with wetland restoration has come from the Netherlands, Finland, and the World Bank.
In the US, the 1972 Clean Water Act mandated Corps of Engineers regulation of wetlands.
The ineffective nationwide permit system was tightened in 1996 to require individual permits for projects of 3-acres instead of 10, then in 2000 half an acre, and one-tenth an acre in the NY City watershed.
Closer scrutiny was required.
Developers who damaged wetlands were required to create new ones.
Declarations of critical habitat for wildlife also limited development.
Illegal projects have been shut down and fined.
Protecting wetlands has been hindered by insufficient enforcement; pressure from politicians, developers and industry; and resistance of residents.
Side effects have included mosquito breeding and beaver damage.
