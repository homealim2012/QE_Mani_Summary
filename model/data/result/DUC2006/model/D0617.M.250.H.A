The October 1999 crash of EgyptAir flight 990 was evaluated for mechanical defects, operational errors, or human sabotage.
The plane plummeted 15,000 feet, but then climbed 8000 feet before its final fall to the ocean.
There was no distress call, and an emergency descent was virtually ruled out.
The tail elevators were in uneven positions, indicating a possible malfunction, but it is not known if this was a cause or byproduct of the crash.
Boeing did step up inspections of its elevator systems.
An in-flight electrical problem could explain why the transponder stopped working, and computer failure could lead to erratic behavior as the pilots tried to regain control.
However, thorough evaluation of the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, radar data, and wreckage led investigators to determine there was no sign of mechanical failure.
EgyptAir said this was its best crew, but there were strange operational events.
Both engines had been switched off from the cockpit, something experienced pilots would not do.
The autopilot was switched off and the plane went into a controlled steep dive.
Investigators found little in recent activities, background, medical history, and emotional stability of crew and passengers.
Further investigation showed the co-pilot was the subject of several investigations by New York hotel security police.
The prayer he uttered and final comments on the cockpit voice recorder led investigators to suspect his suicide.
Electromagnetic interferences by local military radars could have caused shutdown of computerized autopilot, elevators, and engines, but radar evidence is classified.
