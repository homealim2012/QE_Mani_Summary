In the 1990's Gen X was a fashionable synonym for the twentysomethings, post Baby-Boomers, born from 1965-1979, and complete with an entire set of stereotypes.
Many Gen Xers know the only reason they are in this world is that their yuppy parents had money and they are just another possession.
Then they were deserted by divorcing parents and discredited social institutions.
With no rules left to break and everything up for grabs, they have no clear sense of identity.
Alienated and isolated, they have become cynical.
They linger in school, put off marriage, and flit from job to job.
They want eternal adolescence: "Adulthood Lite".
They worry about commitment -- but long to nurture -- babies, pets, even robotic pets!
They shun churches but love spirituality.
Indifferent to politics, they rarely vote, but are big on volunteering.
Gen Xers are not intimidated by authority.
Instead, they are quick to question policies and practices they are uncomfortable with.
However, they have little regard for experience and "working one's way up".
They are creative and comfortable with technology, having grown up intimately linked to media culture -- Internet, TV, film, music.
They are capable of handling change and find it easy to transfer loyalty to whatever job/project they're working on at the moment.
With their independent can-do attitudes and creativity they may be the ones to get things done!
Thus the Gen Xers are not just the latte-scarfing slackers they are often perceived as.
Pinning labels on groups is convenient but dangerous!
