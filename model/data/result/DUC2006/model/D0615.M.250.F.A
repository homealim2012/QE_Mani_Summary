Teaching the origins of life on earth is a controversial and emotional topic.
The consensus amongst scientists and educators is that biology and other aspects of science cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution.
Proponents of evolutionary theory use a plethora of evidence, including fossils and carbon-dating, to show how life forms mutated and branched out from common ancestors in the billions of years since the world came into existence.
Scientists and clergy who believe in both God and evolution are often called upon to help the conservative public in some districts accept evolution as part of the required curriculum.
Proponents of "Creation Science" believe a divine being created humans and other species a mere 10,000 years ago, and generally use the Bible as the ultimate authority on how the world was formed.
They want to teach the evidence against evolution - : intelligent-design theory, abrupt-appearance theory, irreducible-complexity theory, and depth of topsoil.
Sometimes called a pseudoscientific rival to evolution, the inclusion of Creation Science as curriculum may be a violation of the laws of church and state.
Proponents of Intelligent Design don't always posit God as the creator.
They want evolution to be fairly represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life, including the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos require an intelligent designer.
Creative design is seen by some as a compromise and by others as an opening for religion-based teaching to be inserted into the curriculum, which would be unconstitutional.
