It is thought that autism is caused by neurological abnormalities in parts of the brain.
Scientists now suspect mutations of at least 5 or 6 genes on chromosomes 7, 13, and 15, possibly occurring in days 20-24 of gestation.
Although autism is thought to occur in one out of 250-100 children, the true rate is questionable because there has never been a nationwide study.
There are not enough facilities to support the number of autistics and there families and the treatment is expensive.
Many families form their own support groups.
New methods of diagnosing autism include blood testing newborns; children who later develop autism have abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals.
Other signs include subtle abnormalities in body movements of infants as young as 3 months old.
"Applied Behavioral Analysis" (ABA) is the only widely accepted treatment for autism.
It uses repetitive teaching and positive reinforcement.
It is hoped that intervention can be used to stimulate a baby's brain to circumvent"bad wiring" or develop compensatory connections, and the goal of research is to learn how and when to use intervention.
Secretin, a hormone used for gastrointestinal problems, and the antibiotic vancomycin were accidentally found to lessen the characteristics of autism.
Scientists are trying to identify different areas of the brain with different symptoms, and attempts are being made to correlate different areas of brain abnormality with outcome of interventions.
New research shows a possible connection between sex hormones and brain development and susceptibility to neurological disorders.
