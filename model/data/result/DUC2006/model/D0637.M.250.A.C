Solar energy is non-polluting, renewable, and low-cost.
Its use preserves the environment and helps develop the economy.
Solar energy is the most affordable way to bring electricity to remote or hard-to-wire areas that are "off the grid", such as deserts, jungles and mountains.
Solar boats could open up waterways that have been banned to human use because of associated pollution.
Sunny places like North China have great solar energy potential.
Solar energy is popular in developing countries worldwide, including Cameroun, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Somalia, Uganda, and Vietnam.
It is used in heating, cooling, lighting, cooking, refrigeration, telecommunications, meteorology, earthquake forecasts, and forest fire prevention.
Countries that have made advancements in solar energy, such as Israel, Germany, Japan, and Canada, are assisting with solar energy development in China and Africa.
China is also aiding African solar energy development.
In the next 10 years, 253 cooperative solar demonstration projects are to be launched worldwide.
Australia is a leader in solar energy research, with Australian universities developing efficient ultra-thin solar cells and high-tech material for solar thermal electricity.
The US leads in solar equipment manufacturing.
It also leads in solar energy production, followed by Japan and Europe.
Germany is expanding solar cell production.
China is a major solar energy producer and sells it at home and abroad.
The Netherlands is increasing its solar energy use and installing collectors on rooftops.
Israel is a leading solar energy user and does extensive research and development.
Brazil and Mexico are major solar power consumers.
