Indians comprise less than 1% of the population but tribes differ widely.
Tribal burocracies are scattered and ineffective.
Many reservations are remote with little access to development.
Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment.
Poor communications facilities impact the low literacy rate.
Long rides to school means students can't stay to use school resources.
There is poor health care and higher than average death rates from alcohol, diabetes, suicide, and accidents.
The nature of the land -- "held in trust" -- effectively shuts the Indians out of conventional home loan processes.
Federal aid programs are inadequate and impacted by outdated maps and census figures.
Privileges of tribal sovereignty include unique hunting and fishing rights, and the ability to sell gas and cigarettes tax-free, set zooming, and ban or sell alcohol.
Reservations can set up casinos, bringing jobs and money.
However, only a few casinos are profitable.
Furthermore, there is concern that the casinos bring many non-Indians as customers and managers, and erode historic values and traditions.
Tribal sovereignty leads to a number of other issues.
Some reservations impose taxes on non-native Americans who work or live on their land and who do not have any voice in the local government.
Indian cigarette factories, not having to pay tax, can undersell non-reservation factories.
Fishing and hunting privileges cause concern among conservationists that regions will be depleted.
Many feel different rights based on bloodline is unconstitutional.
