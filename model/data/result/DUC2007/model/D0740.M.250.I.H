On March 21, 1999, after 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes aloft, the first persons to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon touched down in Egypt's Sahara Desert.
Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and British adventurer Brian Jones had traveled non-stop for 29,206 miles to complete their record-setting journey.
Piccard had made two previous attempts at the feat in 1997 and 1998 with two differing teams--the first was abandoned after only six hours aloft because of a hazardous fuel leak; the second attempt was aborted after the balloon was denied permission to fly through China's airspace.
On this third, successful voyage, the team launched from Switzerland and drifted southwestward to North Africa before catching a favorable jet stream at 9.27° west longitude.
From there the team flew east across Asia, over the Pacific for six days to Mexico, then across the Atlantic to complete the final leg of their journey.
Piccard and Jones piloted their innovative, helium/hot-air hybrid balloon-- the Breitling Orbiter 3--by controlling the craft's rising and falling in order to catch the winds (typically jet streams) that seemed to be going in the most promising direction; satellite communication, navigation, and weather monitoring systems kept them in touch with their control centers, and provided guidance essential to success and survival.
Achieving what was hailed as the last great milestone of aviation, the two received awards from the International Olympic Committee and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, as well as a $1 million prize from Anheuser-Bush Co.
