In November 1997, The National Institutes of Health gave an unprecedented endorsement of acupuncture.
It said that there was "clear evidence" that acupuncture was effective in treating some types of pain and controlling nausea and vomiting.
An NIH panel added that it should be included in any comprehensive treatment for certain conditions and noted that it has few side effects.
Among the ailments for which acupuncture could be used were low backpain, asthma, post-operative and chemotherapy nausea, drug and other addictions, stroke rehabilitation, fibromyalgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
It is being used increasingly as an alternative treatment for pets, particularly those with skeletal structures similar to a human's, but it is being tried even on dolphions, turtles, and iguanas.
Most medical schools now teach alternative therapies including acupuncture and Health Maintenance Organizations have started to pay for this form of therapy, especially for pain management.
In a random telephone survey, more than 50 per cent of the respondents said that they would be willing to pay more than $15 a month in health insurance for other services including acupuncture.
Acupuncture is even used for face lifts!
To improve appearance, but most acupuncturists would prefer to treat health problems rather than enhance someone's appearance.
