The Oslo Accord of 1993 stipulated that the Israeli Army would pull back from 80% of Hebron in the West Bank by March 28, 1996.
A second phase of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was to be completed by September 1997.
A third and final withdrawal from all of the West Bank would take place before a final peace agreement set for May 4, 1999.
The Accords were based on the principle of land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace for the Israelis.
Final status talks would include: the status of Jerusalem; the border of the Palestinian entity; the fate of Palestinian refugees; the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank; the Gaza Strip; and water.
The first Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was delayed after a series of suicide bombing attacks, and again pending the Israeli elections.
After the ascent of Netanyahu as Israeli Prime Minister, progress stalled in the face of vigorous Israeli settlement in the West Bank in defiance of the Oslo accords.
By 1998 the two sides were still at loggerheads over withdrawal from the West Bank although they should have reached final status talks two years earlier according to the accords.
Modification of the Oslo accords was followed by some progress in the Wye Plantation peace agreement in October 1998, but by June 2000 as the Palestinians and Israelis embarked on final status talks, Israel had handed over control of only 40% of the West Bank.
