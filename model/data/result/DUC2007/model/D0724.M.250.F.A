Obesity is a major health problem in the United States.
Statistics on the extent of obesity are varied but one fact is clear: the problem is getting worse rather than better.
Some statistical studies either combine or confuse the obese and the overweight.
Reports from 1998-2000 showed 55-58% of the U.S. population either overweight or obese.
58% of African-Americans were in the group with 54% of Latinos and 44% of whites.
Studies found 20-33% of adults and 15% of children obese and one study placed the figure for Americans as a whole at 17.9%.
Between 1991 and 1999 the obesity rate for Americans as a whole increased about 50% from 12% to 17.9%.
In 1991 only 4 states had a rating greater than 15% while in 1999 45 states reached that level.
The southeast U.S. increased 67.2% and Georgia led the nation with an increase of 101.8%. West Virginia had the highest rate of obesity at 22.9%.
The cause of obesity is a complicated combination of genetic and environmental factors.
While genetic factors influence appetite and the weight-gaining effect of a given quantity of food, the basic causes of the problem are over- consumption of high-calorie food and lack of adequate exercise.
Specific examples of this mix are over-promotion and over-consumption of huge servings of fast food, lack of sidewalks and exercise facilities ad too much television.
More generally, the cause is a culture of abundance and inactivity.
