In June 1996 the Basque separatist group ETA declared a week-long cease-fire in its 27-year violent struggle for independence.
ETA demanded that the Spanish government change its policy of placing ETA prisoners in jails far outside Basque country.
The government called on ETA to give up its arms altogether.
Nothing came of the cease-fire.
Violence by the ETA continued through 1997 and into 1998.
In June 1998 the political ally of ETA, Herri Batasuma (HB) demanded a negotiated solution to violence calling for Basque independence and improved conditions for ETA prisoners.
The Spanish Prime Minister ruled out negotiation with HB unless it distanced itself from ETA or ETA laid down its arms.
In September a coalition of Basque nationalists including HB signed the Lizarra Declaration calling on ETA to renounce violence.
ETA declared an open-ended cease-fire.
In November the Spanish government agreed to preliminary talks with ETA but would only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners.
It offered to transfer some prisoners to Basque country if ETA renounced violence for good.
An ETA spokesman said transfer of all prisoners would be a step towards peace talks.
Spain offered to move 21 prisoners closer to Basque country but insisted on an end to violence.
A single round of talks ended in stalemate and the truce ended in December 1999.
By September 2000 twelve more ETA-related killings were recorded and French authorities had arrested the Chief of ETA.
