Pakistan has consistently tied its acceptance of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to India's acceptance of the agreement.
While confronting reports that Pakistan was preparing for a nuclear test in 1996, a Foreign Office spokesman denied the reports, stating "Pakistan has been in the vanguard...to advance the cause of non-proliferation" but "Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan...have fumbled because of India's negativism".
After India's series of nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, 1998, the Pakistani Prime Minister commented "...the Indian actions rendered...instruments such as Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty...irrelevant".
When Pakistan responded to the Indian challenge with its own series of tests May 28 and 30, the international community called on both countries to negotiate their differences over Kashmir and sign on to the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
Many countries imposed sanctions on both countries.
Pakistan refused to sign the NPT on the basis that it was unfair with its double standards allowing some nations to maintain nuclear arsenals and denying that right to others.
Sanctions against a non-signatory country for failing to comply with the NPT were deemed "unjust and unrealistic".
A Foreign Office spokesman pointed out "treaty provisions cannot be enforced on non-parties".
In September 1998 Pakistan's Prime Minister agreed to unilaterally adhere to the CTBT but in 2000 Pakistan reasserted its determination to maintain credible nuclear deterrence to prevent any aggression against it.
