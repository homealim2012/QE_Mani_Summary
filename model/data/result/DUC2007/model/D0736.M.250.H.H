Oprah Winfrey has become the richest and most influential woman in entertainment.
Her popularity stems primarily from her TV talk show that has won 32 daytime Emmy's in its focus on family relationships, health, fashion, beauty, and books.
Oprah started a book club to encourage inspirational reading and has invited writers such as Robert Morgan, author of "Gap Creek", and change-your-life guru, John Gray, to discuss their books.
She also, for the first time, recently invited presidential candidate Al Gore, followed a week later by George Bush, both in an appeal for women's votes.
Recently she has begun featuring a "change your life" theme on her show that focuses on who you are and a truth-will-set-you-free attitude.
Much of her show's subject matter stems from her own sexually abused girlhood.
She is developing a new TV channel named Oxygen and starting a magazine, both intended to inspire women.
Her book club promotions have won her a 50th Anniversary Medal by the National Book Foundation.
She has produced TV movies based on some of the promoted books.
Her show declined, however, briefly after her disappointing role in "Beloved".
She also faced a lawsuit because her show allegedly "melodramatized" the mad cow disease.
She was cleared of giving false information and defaming cattle producers.
Oprah received high praises for teaching a class at Northwestern University on "Dynamics of Leadership".
The TV movie "Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays with Morrie" was named best TV movie in September 2000.
She still inspires promotional reading.
