Eric Rudolph, a 31-year old carpenter is wanted for bombing an Alabama abortion clinic on 29 January 1998 and three bombings in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997.
An explosion July 27, 1996 at Centennial Olympic Park killed one woman and injured 111 people.
In a pair of explosions January 27, 1997, seven people were injured outside an Atlanta abortion clinic.
A bombing at a gay nightclub in Atlanta February 21, 1997 injured five people.
Rudolph became a suspect when witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the January 1998 bombing.
A North Carolina license plate on the man's truck was traced to him.
Six months later, Rudolph was identified by a food store owner near Nantahale Lake in Western North Carolina not far from where he first lived.
He stole the man's truck and took about a six-month supply of food.
About 200 FBI, state, and local officials began searching the remote densely forested area employing helicopters, dogs, and survival-training volunteers.
Evidence from the abandoned truck, buried trash, and boot prints proved he was in the area.
A one-million dollar reward for information, distribution of photos, and prime-time TV exposure were employed to no avail.
Rudolph has eluded police for three years.
He is an experienced survivalist, knows the area well, has altered his identity by growing a beard and long hair, and is probably hiding in one of the area's hundreds of caves or mines.
The search effort has been reduced to relying on volunteer information.
