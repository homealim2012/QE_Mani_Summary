Al Gore formed a campaign organization at the start of 1999.
The only obvious opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000 was Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
Gore began touring the country gathering support from diverse groups and talking to citizens one-on-one to overcome his reputation for stiffness.
He appointed women and blacks to his campaign staff to counter his reputation of operating with an inner circle of white males.
He gained an early endorsement from Minority Leader Gephardt and polls in early 1999 showed him a clear favorite for the Democratic nomination, but a distinct underdog when pitted against potential Republican candidate George W. Bush.
By the end of April the campaign had raised $8.9 million.
During the remainder of 1999 Gore received endorsements from many prestigious people including Hillary Clinton, the Governor and both California Senators, 600 Latino leaders, and Rep. Patrick Kennedy.
But polls indicated a stronger than expected challenge by Bill Bradley.
The lingering effects of the Clinton impeachment trial posed a problem which Gore hoped to palliate by moving campaign headquarters from lobbyists' row on K Street in Washington back to the folks at home in Gore's native state of Tennessee in October.
Sen. Ted Kennedy endorsed Gore at the start of 2000 and assisted with campaigning for the New Hampshire primary.
By the end of February Gore was ahead of Bradley in polls 56%-32%.
By August Gore and Sen. Lieberman made up the Democratic presidential ticket.
