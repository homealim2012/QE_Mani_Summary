Angelina Jolie's screen debut was in one of her father John Voight's movies "Looking to Get Out" (1982) at the age of 6.
As a young adult, her early movie roles include appearances in "Hackers" (1995) and "Foxfire" (1996).
She won back-to-back Golden Globe awards for her TV movie performances in "George Wallace" (1997) and "Gia" (1998).
Jolie took a short break from acting after "Gia" and studied film writing and directing at New York University.
She soon returned to acting and won Golden Globe, Screen Actors' Guild and Academy awards as best supporting actress in "Girl Interrupted" (1999).
Other film credits include "Playing God" (1998), "Playing by Heart" (1999), and "Pushing Tin" (1999).
She costarred with Denzel Washington in "The Bone Collector" (1999), the first film for which her name appeared above the title.
Soon after divorcing actor Jonny Miller, Jolie married "Pushing Tin" costar Billy Bob Thornton in a quickie Las Vegas ceremony in May 2000.
That same year, Jolie starred with Antonio Banderas in "Dancing in the Dark", and opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in "Gone in 60 Seconds", a box office hit despite poor reviews.
Aside from films, Jolie appeared on the spring 1999 cover of Allure and in the Rolling Stones video "Has Anybody Seen My Baby"?
Upcoming films credits will include starring as Lara Croft in "Tomb Raider" and with Kevin Costner and Meg Ryan in Oliver Stone's "Beyond Borders".
Jolie turned down a leading role in "Charlie's Angels".
