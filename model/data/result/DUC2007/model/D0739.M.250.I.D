After "Seinfeld" ended, Jerry Seinfeld did a stand-up tour, a 10-show Broadway run, and an HBO special, "I'm Telling You This for the Last Time".
He planned a second TV special and a comedy album based on the first.
Seinfeld, who says he'll never do another sitcom, has done some commercial promotions.
He married Jessica Sklar, who became pregnant with their first child in 2000.
Cast members Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Michael Richards also have done numerous commercials.
Alexander appeared as Boris Badenov in the movie "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle".
Richards took it easy after "Seinfeld," but now plans to star as befuddled private detective Vic Nardozza in "The Michael Richards Show" on NBC.
Recurring cast members Estelle Harris (George's mother), Wayne Knight (Newman), Phil Morris (Jackie Chiles), and Patrick Warburton (Puddy) can be seen selling a variety of products.
Morris considered starring in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Seinfeld and Larry David.
After the show ended, a 68-page script from the 1992-93 season with all the "alrights" was auctioned for $1,500 to $2,000.
TBS purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated repeats of "Seinfeld" beginning fall 2002 and lasting four years.
To assist saddened "Seinfeld" lovers, AllHerb.com offered "As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kits" which included a free month's supply of Saint Johnswort and a list of 25 names that rhyme with female body parts.
NBC moved its next-best comedy "Frasier" into "Seinfeld's" timeslot.
David starred in a special and show on HBO, both called "Curb Your Enthusiasm".
