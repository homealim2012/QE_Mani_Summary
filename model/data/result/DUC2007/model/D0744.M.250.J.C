Organic foods are those which have not been affected by radiation, genetic engineering, antibiotics, pesticides, preservatives, hormones or post-packaging additives.
Congress ordered national organic standards in 1990.
The first USDA proposal came in 1997 but was rejected by the industry for allowing irradiated and genetically engineered food and the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
Farms nationwide claiming to be organic were certified by 88 different state or certifying agencies with few controls or on-site inspections.
The absence of labeling hurt exports, costing American farmers $200M annually because genetically modified corn cannot be separated from the rest.
Europeans and Japanese do not want gene-altered crops.
In the 90's, U.S. sales of organic foods grew 20% annually, exceeding $3.6 billion in 1996.
Crop acreage doubled.
More than 10,000 farms were raising organic crops and livestock.
Production of organic eggs and milk increased even more.
There were attacks from the conventional food industry (e.g.
, Dennis Avery's "Saving the Planet With Pesticides and Plasic" - Hudson Instutute, 1995) but participation by companies such as General Mills and grocery chains such as Albertsons, Krogers and Winn-Dixie were evidence that organic food had joined the mainstream.
New USDA standards were expected to be finalized in late 2000 and put into effect 18 months later.
Agriculture Secretary Glickman said the new standards will be the "most comprehensive, strictest organic rules in the world".
Products meeting the standard will be labeled "USDA Certified Organic".
The USDA's new budget included a $5.5 million request for organic research.
