American Home Products Corp. removed the diet drug fenfluramine, also known as Pondimin or the fen in fen-phen, from the market in 1997 after a study linked it to potentially fatal heart valve injury.
In Texas, a number of plaintiffs sued the manufacturer for injuries resulting from fenfluramine use.
Sandra Moore sued for her mild heart valve damage and settled for a reported $500,000.
Debbie Lovett sued for her moderate to severe damage.
She eventually settled for a fraction of the $23.3 million a jury awarded her.
Survivors of Mary Smith alleged she died of primary pulmonary hypertension resulting from taking fenfluramine.
The trial ended with a $6-$7 million settlement.
American Home Products reportedly paid over $3 million to 70-year-old Ruth Burks, who attributed her rare lung disease to the drug.
Former fenfluramine user Virginia Brinkley, who was facing a third valve-replacement surgery, settled her lawsuit for $8-9 million.
In Mississippi, the company agreed to pay $350-400 million to settle 1,400 injury cases after a jury awarded $150 million to five other plaintiffs.
Four weeks later, six more women sued there.
Several wrongful death cases in the country were settled for about $4-5 million each.
Survivors of Mary Linnen of Massachusetts settled for an undisclosed amount.
Over 4,100 lawsuits have been filed against American Home Products over fenfluramine.
In October 2000, the company settled a class-action suit, agreeing to pay a $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide.
The deal would pay individual plaintiffs up to $1.5 million.
