The International or World Court located in The Hague, Netherlands is made up of 15 permanent judges plus two others nominated by the parties involved in a dispute.
It's purpose is to handle disputes between nations and sometimes acts in conjunction with war crimes tribunals.
The court has no power to enforce its orders but its decisions often carry diplomatic weight.
For example, when it found the United States guilty of illegally mining the harbors of Nicaragua, the US ignored its verdict, but in another case when it sided with the United States, the US worked to enforce the Court's decision.
It is up to the discretion of the parties involved whether to submit to the judgment of the Court.
