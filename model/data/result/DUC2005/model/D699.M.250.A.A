The issue of term limits is concerned with whether or not career politicians are good for the country, the state, or the locality.
Proponents see career politicians as a threat.
They argue that individuals in office for long periods lose their perspective and stop listening to constituents, that they block the rise of new leadership, and that to stay in office they are likely to bow to special interests groups and their money.
Incumbents have an advantage in elections.
In Congressional elections, 98 percent of incumbents seeking reelection win year after year.
Proponents say that term limits will dilute the power of incumbents and will keep elected officials more accountable to the electorate and more likely to push for reforms.
Opponents argue that term limits will produce newly elected officials highly dependent on the people around them.
As a result, the functioning of government will not improve and the power of unelected officials, bureaucrats, and interest groups will increase.
They say that term limits will force out talented, experienced, and highly regarded politicians with strong ties to their constituents.
They also say that limits will take away voter's rights to select the elected officials they want.
Pro and con arguments on term limit at the federal, state, and local levels are all very similar.
Two differences about limits at the state level are, on the pro side, they could result in more minorities being elected; on the con side, with inexperienced legislators the Legislature could become dominated by the governor.
