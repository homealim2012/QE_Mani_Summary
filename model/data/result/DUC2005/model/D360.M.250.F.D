Although many strong arguments are made against drug legalization, equally strong arguments are made in favor of legalization, particularly of marijuana, but also of other recreational drugs.
Those in favor argue that drug money now goes to drug dealers and big drug cartels much of it in Colombia and other countries.
If recreational drugs were legal, profits from the sale of drugs would go to American businesses and to the American government through taxes.
Currently much taxpayer money is being spent to fight the war on drugs.
They also argue that much drug-related crime both internationally and in poor neighborhoods would disappear if drugs were sold legally.
Advocates use the sale of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages as examples of addictive substances already being sold legally.
They even point out that the dangers from marijuana use are fewer that from tobacco and alcohol.
Marijuana is also considered one of the safest therapeutic drugs for pain management.
Warnings could be placed on packages of marijuana similar to those currently found on cigarette packets and advertising could be limited in a similar manner to alcohol and tobacco advertising.
Some studies on the effects of decriminalization of marijuana show that rates of consumption either remained the same as before decriminalization or, in several instances, actually decreased.
