Wildlife in danger of extinction includes species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.
Threatened mammals include golden lion tamarins in Brazil; African elephants poached for their ivory tusks; black and white rhinos hunted for their horns; Indian tigers hunted to meet the demand for tiger bone; jaguars and black Howler monkeys in Belize; blue and humpback whales; Arabian Oryxes; black-footed ferrets; tigers in Sumatra; bison in Poland; wild dogs in southern Africa; African manatees; giant Pandas; lemurs in Madagascar; harp and hooded seals; bears in the Pyrenees; and orangutans in Indonesia.
Threatened birds include red kites, British barn owls, and North American whooping cranes; threatened reptiles include sea turtles in waters from the Caribbean to the Atlantic and from the Mediterranean to the Pacific; and threatened amphibians include South American caimans and Majorcan toads.
Programs seeking to protect wildlife from extinction can be grouped together according to the nature of the methods they use.
One group of programs is concerned with banning or restricting activities, such as trading in ivory, poaching of rhinos, commercial whaling, hunting turtles, and importing baby sealskins; and with punishing those engaged in such activities, such as embargoing imports from countries failing to stem trade in rhino and tiger parts.
Another group of programs is concerned with establishing conservation areas, such as the preserve in Belize for jaguars and monkeys and the whale sanctuary around Antarctica where hunting is prohibited.
Another group deals with breeding endangered species, such as whooping cranes and tamarins, in captivity.
