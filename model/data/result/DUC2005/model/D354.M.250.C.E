Journalism is a dangerous profession.
Journalists have been murdered, killed in other ways, kidnapped, arrested, imprisoned, tortured, threatened, and banished.
Journalists in war and riot zones are subject to the life-threatening dangers as are the warriors and those attempting to quell riots.
In attempting to report the news, they have been victims in nearly all parts of the world but mostly in war zones, where governments suppress opposition, or where there is no established law and order.
Some governments target journalists whose reporting is contrary, or even hostile, to that government's programs or actions.
Drug cartels, groups attempting to overthrow a government, guerilla bands, criminal activities, e.g., the Mafia have kidnapped and murdered journalists for their expose activity or for merely witnessing activity intended to be unrevealed.
The number of journalists killed was on the increase during the latter half of the 1980s.
The existence of the "Committee to Protect Journalists" testifies to the recognition that journalism is a dangerous profession.
