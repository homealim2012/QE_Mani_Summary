The world's population was estimated to grow from 5.7 billion in 1994 to 10 billion by 2050.
Depending on assumptions about birth rates, this figure could range from 7.8 to 12.5 billion.
Birth rates vary considerably by region.
Fertility rate -- the average number of children per women -- is 4 in India, 2.4 in China, but more than 6 in sub-Saharan Africa.
Africa's growth rate is 2.9 percent, the world's highest; Asia and Latin America have rates less than 2 percent; Western Europe's rate is 1.7 percent.
Factors influencing fertility rates include economic conditions, access to contraception, educational and economic opportunities for women, and government birth control policies and programs.
