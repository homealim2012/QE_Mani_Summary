Health related problems and injuries related to working with computers have become commonplace.
The US estimates that as many as five million workers are affected resulting in a cost of about 27 billion dollars in medical expenses and lost income annually.
The most common problem is repetitive strain injury, RSI, followed by vision, back, and stress related problems.
RSI is a painful and sometimes disabling disorder that affects necks, shoulders, arms, and hands.
Carpal tunnel syndrome caused by the use of the mouse results in tingling and pain in thumbs and fingers, a weakening of the thumb, and often severe nerve damage.
Vision disorders are caused by extended viewing of the monitor screen.
Many manufacturers of computer equipment and office furniture are working on ergonomic designs which lessen the strain of using the computer.
These include adjustable chairs with built-in lumbar support, redesigned keyboards that support wrists and keep hands in a more relaxed position while typing, a mouse that will keep the hand in a more natural position, and screens that adjust for height.
Some state and local government agencies as well as the European Community have passed labor regulations to help prevent computer-related injuries.
The regulations call for frequent rest breaks for workers, proper office lighting, and adjustable furniture and equipment.
There are many helpful guidelines for computer workers to help prevent the onset of RSI or other related problems.
guidelines offer suggested helpful exercises, proper posture while at the computer, and personal adjustment of equipment.
