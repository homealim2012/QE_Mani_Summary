Traditional plants melt coke and ore in a blast furnace to make pig iron, which is processed into steel.
Two new technologies -- electric arc furnaces and thin-slab casting -- are being used in mini-mills to produce steel.
Mini-mills use scrap metal and iron as raw materials, turning them into steel in an electric arc furnace.
Benefits of this technology include savings on raw material by using recycled scrap and cost savings by avoiding making of expensive pig iron.
Mini-mills require less land than traditional mills and have lower capital demands and operating costs.
However, they require adequate electricity and scrap metal availability, and the steel produced is best suited for special applications as construction.
Traditionally, sheet steel is made by poring molten steel into a mold, shaping it into slabs, and turning the slabs into finished steel through a series of rolling operations.
The thin-slab casting process produces slabs using special tunnel molding and immediately compresses the slabs into finished steel.
Benefits of thin-slab casting are that is quicker, simpler, and has lower energy and labor costs than the traditional process because it cuts out several stages.
However, it has tighter process control parameters, as temperature.
In addition, the steel produced is best suited for the low-end of the steel market.
Nucor is the largest US mini-mill steel manufacture.
Co-Steel has mini-mills in the US, Canada, and Britain.
Nucor, Iscor, Armco, and LTV -- teamed with British Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries -- and other companies are planning mini-mills.
