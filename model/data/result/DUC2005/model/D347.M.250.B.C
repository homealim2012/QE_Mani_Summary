A wide variety of animals are in endangered around the world.
Among them are large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses, big cats such as tigers and snow leopards, and smaller animals such as black-footed ferrets and indri lemurs.
Endangered primates include orangutans, gorillas, and monkeys.
Among the many endangered birds are whooping cranes and barn owls.
Reptiles such as snakes, toads, and caimans are in trouble, as are many ocean creatures including whales, manatees, sea turtles, and seals.
Numerous programs have been created to protect these endangered species.
Many programs breed animals in captivity and release them into their native habitats.
Other programs create nature and wildlife reserves which not only protect the species, but their habitats as well.
