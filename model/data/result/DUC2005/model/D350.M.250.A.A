Many health problems have been identified with working with computers.
They include repetitive strain injury (RSI), carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), eyestrain and "sick-building syndrome".
RTI refers to the painful and sometimes debilitating range of conditions affecting the neck, shoulders, arms, wrists, and hands.
It is caused by performing repetitive tasks as punching a keyboard thousands of times an hour, for several hours at a time.
It is also associated with extended mouse usage.
RTI accounts for most work-related injuries; in 1994, more than 2,000 RSI lawsuits against computer manufactures were filed, with similar lawsuits filed in the UK and Australia.
CTS is caused by repeated movements involving the wrist, such as when using a mouse and or keyboard.
Its symptoms include tingling feelings and pain in the thumb, index finger, and middle fingers and a weakening of the thumb.
Eyestrain is a common complaint among those who use computers frequently.
It is caused by prolonged staring at computer screens or visual display units (VDUs).
Its symptoms include blurred vision.
Sick-building syndrome has flu-like symptoms and affects thousands of office workers, mostly those working with computers.
It is though to be caused by dust attracted to terminals, which then settles on the face of the users.
Ergonomically designed mice, keyboards, screens, and office furniture are being introduced into the workplace, and new workplace health and safety standards are being mandated.
Use of these new products and standards in the workplace, combined with worker training, could reduce computer-related health problems.
