In the early 1990s, women were poorly represented in many parliaments.
In 1992, less than nine percent of the MPs in the UK parliament were women, six percent of the US Senate were women, and less than 1 percent of both the upper and lower houses of parliament in Pakistan were women.
In 1993, less than two percent of the deputies in the Turkish parliament were women.
While women made some progress in gaining political power, such as the election of a woman prime minister in Poland in 1992 and in Turkey in 1993, they made little headway in traditional, male-dominated countries.
In 1992, the number of women candidates for the Japanese upper house decreased by half.
In 1993, members of the Swiss parliament rejected a women from the country's cabinet because of her feminist life style.
Several countries considered election system reforms to raise the percentages of women in parliaments.
One reform considered in the UK was the list system where female candidates are stacked at or near the top of a political party's list.
Another was the additional member system featuring both directly elected and party appointed representatives.
Quota systems to ensure gender equality were proposed for the Turkish parliament and for parties of the planned Scottish parliament.
Pakistan considered reserving 20 seats for women in its lower house.
Countries as the US relied on political processes rather than quotas for increasing the number of female candidates.
The 1992 Senate election featured a record 11 women candidates.
