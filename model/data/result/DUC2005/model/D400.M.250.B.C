Many of the environmental problems of the Amazon rainforest result from the slash and burn cycle of clearing used by ranchers and farmers.
Whenever the soil gives out, more land is cleared.
The rainforest suffers great losses from wide scale logging, illegal logging, illegal mining, chaotic development, roadway construction, and hydroelectric projects.
In 1987, deforestation caused 1.2 million tons of carbon to be released into the atmosphere.
Currently, 40 tree species are at risk of extinction.
Peru's coca fields cause 10% of its deforestation.
Unterraced hills of coca trees cause erosion and deadly landslides.
Coca growers' herbicides and refining chemicals wash into rivers.
Oil companies, through negligence, recklessness, and intentional activities, have polluted and destroyed countless acres of rainforest.
Bolivia's wood industry is unsustainable, causing its forests to dwindle.
In order to preserve the rainforest, Brazil ended subsidies to ranchers for forest clearance, and made a law prohibiting landowners from clearing more that 50% of their property.
Efforts are underway to teach farmers proper harvesting techniques and wean them from the slash and burn cycle.
Sustainable forestry and development techniques, such as reforestation, are being employed, and environmental and economic zones have been established to protect threatened species.
An effort is underway to link indigenous people's welfare to the welfare of the rainforest in order to encourage them to protect it.
A technological surveillance system will be built to monitor the Amazon for environmental research.
Numerous research projects in forest management are being funded by Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Bolivia.
