Argentina and Great Britain engaged in a war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands, islands in the South Atlantic claimed by Argentina but occupied by Britain.
After the war, Britain imposed an arms embargo and Argentina imposed restrictions on imports from Britain.
Relations between Argentina and Britain eventually improved: in 1989, Argentina lifted restrictions on imports from Britain, and they cooperated during 1991 Gulf War.
Full diplomatic relations between the two countries resumed in February 1990.
Argentina made discreet attempts to resume military ties, but was rebuffed and the arms embargo continued.
Carlos Memen assumed the office of President of Argentina in 1991 and adopted free-market and pro-western policies which made trade with Argentina and investments there more attractive.
Trade between Argentina and Britain then began to recover.
Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.
Britain reduced the cost of insurance protecting against possible losses resulting from investments in Argentina.
In 1993, for the first time since the war, high-level ministers from both countries exchanged visits.
A British consortium bought Argentina's largest gas distribution company in a privatization auction.
Both countries held talks regarding joint oil and gas projects in Falkland waters.
Argentina also hoped to attract British investment in their privatized nuclear industry.
Two continuing sources of tension between Argentina and Britain have been Argentina's Falkland sovereignty claims and Britain's efforts to protect Falkland fishing revenues from illex squid, also competed for by Argentine and Asian fisherman and thought to be over-exploited.
