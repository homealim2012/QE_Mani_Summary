Until recent times, Malaysia was the world's largest producer of tin.
Tin mining was a centuries old tradition in the country.
In the mid-19th century tracts of land were given over to tin concessions.
Many Chinese immigrants came to work in the mines.
In the 1960s, Malaysia was producing between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of tin annually and employing over 200,000 workers in the industry.
By 1993 only about 4000 people worked in the tin mines producing less than 10,000 tons.
Beginning in 1985 too much tin had been stockpiled in many countries in the world and was released on the market.
Prices for tin fell dramatically and tin mining operations, particularly those involved in high cost hard rock mining, were forced to close down or cut back operation.
During this same period, three countries that had lower labor costs, China, Indonesia, and Brazil raised output of tin to become bigger producers than Malaysia.
Furthermore, the demand for tin for use in food storage was being replaced by glass, aluminum, and plastic.
In spite of the huge drop in demand, CEOs of tin mines remain cautiously optimistic looking toward new uses for tin in plating car components, fire-retardant packaging, solders, lead-free tin alloy for gunshot, and tin bottle capsules.
The Association of Tin Producing Countries met in 1993 to discuss ways to reduce global stockpiling and save the industry.
Meanwhile, Malaysia has moved away from commodity production and put its capital in modern technologies, electronics, tourism, and real estate.
