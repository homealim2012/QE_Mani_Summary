The Salvation Army in both the United States and Great Britain offers help to the homeless and the needy.
In England the Salvation Army is working to break the cycle of homelessness by making available long-term housing and outreach support.
In the US the Army offers shelters for the homeless supplying hot meals, cots, blankets, and hygiene supplies in most areas of the country.
They provide motel rooms and emergency food for homeless families on a short- term basis.
The Salvation Army has a strong religious commitment to never turn away a homeless child.
The Army runs a 56- bed shelter and program exclusively for women alcoholics.
They also run soup kitchens and contribute to food pantries.
At holiday time the Army supplies food, toys, and other gifts to needy families.
An Army holiday innovation is the Adopt-A-Family project where one family can volunteer to give gifts to a needy family at Christmas time.
As a religious organization, the Army offers weekly Christian worship services accompanied by a home-cooked meal.
The Salvation Army runs Door of Hope, a provider of maternity care, scholarships, and drug and child-abuse programs.
They actively contribute to disaster relief and were one of many organizations providing aid to victims of hurricane Hugo.
The Army cooperates with other charitable organizations to help the needy.
