Causes of train accidents found by investigations fall into these categories.
Faulty or damaged equipment include track, wheels, breaks, signaling equipment and cargo braces.
Human factors include driver errors; not complying with light signals; signaling procedure errors; improper coupling of cars and engines; improper breaks connections; inaccurate cargo manifests; poor communication among train crews; poor communication between police and railway operators; improper switch operation; vehicle error at crossings; and improper maintenance.
Substance abuse includes operating a train under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Management errors include failure to train drivers in difficult maneuvers and emergency procedures, and failure to systematically implement existing policies for identification, management and monitoring of hazards.
Under-funding delayed implementation of safety measures, such as installation of "Automatic Train Protection" systems.
Natural causes include floods and ice.
Other causes include poor track design, such as conversion of double track to single track for bidirectional travel; vandalism; and pedestrians on tracks, including suicides.
Formal recommendations for avoiding train accidents include replacing older trains with new ones; putting data recorders on all trains; improving driver emergency training, especially regarding 1) past accident scenarios, 2) light signal compliance, and 3) emergency breaking; improving accuracy of cargo weight listings; improving communications among crews members; installing "Automatic Train Protection" systems; redesigning buffer stops; supervising drivers' fitness for work; making it illegal for railway workers with safety responsibilities to be impaired by alcohol or drugs; allowing drug testing after incidents; and investigating problems of sudden light changes between outdoors and illuminated stations.
