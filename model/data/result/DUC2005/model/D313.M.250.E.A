Magnetically levitated (maglev) trains are propelled along a guideway by electromagnetic forces on a slight cushion of air.
In the early 1990's, maglev technology was under development in Japan and in Germany.
The Railway Technical Research Institute, an affiliate of Japan Railroad with national and local government support, was building a 27-mile test track.
HSST Corporation of Nagoya, a public-private joint venture, was promoting maglev system for both intercity and commuter uses.
In Germany, three engineering groups, Thyssen, AEG, and Siemens, together with Lufthansa and the German railway system, joined forces to form a new company to develop and build a maglev train between Hamburg and Berlin, and possibly to Bonn, Bremen and Cologne.
The system was to be built with public funds and operated by the new company.
In 1990, the HSST Corporation offered to pay for a 155.6-mile maglev commuter system linking downtown Los Angeles, Orange County, and the San Fernando Valley.
Also in 1990, California evaluated proposals to construct a 65-mile maglev system from the Los Angeles International Airport through the San Fernando Valley to Palmdale.
The system would serve both commuters and travelers to the airport.
Construction costs were to be paid with a combination of state and private funds, and the state was to provide rights of way.
Again, in 1990, California designated a consortium to build a privately funded 265-mile maglev system between Anaheim and Las Vegas.
In 1994, Switzerland began a feasibility study for an underground maglev train between Geneva and Zurich.
