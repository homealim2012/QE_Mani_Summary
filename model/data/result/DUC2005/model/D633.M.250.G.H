From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community.
The PM argued forcefully to preserve the union of England, Scotland and Wales.
The Plaid MPs, as buoyed as most Scotts by North Ireland's prospective self-rule, said self-government was urgent so Wales could participate directly in forthcoming EC meetings to get funds.
Plaid had only four MPs from 38 Welsh districts, who opposed self-rule in a 1979 referendum four-to-one.
The opposition Labour Party, long strong in South Wales, campaigned in 1992 parliamentary elections by nurturing popularity throughout the UK for devolution.
Labour MP candidates committed to create a Welsh "assembly", not self-government, with representation to the EC's soon-to-be-formed Committee of the Regions, "within the life-time" of a prospective Labour-formed UK government, as well as assemblies for the English regions, and a Scottish Parliament with taxing powers.
Plaid MPs demanded Labour treat Wales as favorably as Scotland on devolution with taxing powers, and give financial aid to Wales.
Remembering 1979, Labour MPs rejected Tory MPs demands for a referendum on Welsh devolution, deferring instead to their parliamentary election mandate.
Concurrently, a white paper restructuring Welsh government into unitary districts, written by the British appointed Secretary of Wales, an English constituency Tory opposed to Welsh self-rule, was rejected by the Welsh Counties but supported by the underlying Districts.
Implementation was postponed until at least 1995.
