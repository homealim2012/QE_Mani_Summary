Founded in the middle of the 19th century, the Salvation Army is a worldwide organization, which, as part of its religious mission, engages in various activities to help the needy, often partnering with other charities.
Sometimes under contract with localities, the Army operates shelters for the homeless, supplying cots, blankets, personal hygiene supplies, and hot meals.
In the San Fernando Valley, the Army provides shelter for homeless men at two Adult Rehabilitation Centers; and provides emergency food to homeless men, women, and children at their San Fernando Valley Corps Community Center.
The Army operates facilities, as the one in Los Angeles, where alcoholics can come in off the streets for a meal or a shower and can receive employment counseling and alcohol and drug education.
In partnership with Los Angeles and the federal government, the Army runs a transitional housing program where families threatened by eviction and the homeless are housed in trailers.
In Orange County the Army operates, with Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, a food distribution center for the poor.
It provided food and fuel in Massachusetts to those in need because of the economic decline.
Together with other charitable organizations, it distributed toys to children in Orange County and food and clothing to the poor in Oceanside.
Working with other charitable organizations, the Army provides emergency aid programs where and when needed.
They helped victims of Hurricane Hugo, and after the San Francisco earthquake, they set up a relief center to provide food, water, clothing, blankets, and cots.
