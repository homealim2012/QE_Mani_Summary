Poaching is the illegal killing or taking of endangered wildlife.
Poached animals are used for food, clothing, medicine, jewelry, and trophies; live animals are supplied to the pet trade and to zoos.
African elephants are poached for their tusks and are killed as pests because they trample on crop fields.
Both black and white rhinos in Africa are hunted for their horns sold in the Far East for their aphrodisiac properties.
Tigers in India are poached for their skins and to meet a demand for tiger bone used in Chinese medicine.
Giant Pandas in China are poached, as are bison in Poland.
Black bears in the Northeastern US are killed for their gall bladders used in the Far East as an aphrodisiac.
Raptors are killed in Nevada for body parts, such as golden eagle feathers and hawk talons, to use as decorative trophies.
Infant mountain gorillas in Rwanda are stolen to supply zoos, and adult gorillas are killed for food and use as trophies.
A variety of steps are being taken to prevent poaching of endangered species.
International bans have been placed on elephant poaching, and conventions have been signed that prohibit trading in tusks and tiger bone.
Preserves have been established where wildlife is protected.
Law enforcement against poachers has been strengthened with shoot-to- kill policies and with aerial monitoring of known poaching areas.
There are efforts to reduce demand for animal parts by toughening and enforcing import controls and efforts to reduce supply, such as by dehorning rhinos.
