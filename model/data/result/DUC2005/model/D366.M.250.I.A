Cyanide and cyanide compounds, as hydrogen and sodium cyanide, are used in mining processes, electroplating, manufacturing, and other commercial applications.
In the heap-leaching process used to extract gold and silver, ore is first placed in a heap on an impermeable plastic pad and then a weak cyanide solution is sprinkled over the ore.
The solution collects at the bottom after percolating through the ore and dissolving most of the ore.
A similar process is used to process copper mined from open-air pits.
Electroplating of metal parts, such as aircraft parts, involves placing the parts in cyanide and acid baths.
Hydrogen cyanide is used in manufacturing chemicals, such as tryptophan and other amino acids.
Cyanide is also used to recover silver from X-ray film.
Cyanide entering air, water, or the soil from commercial activities could have adverse impacts on animals and plants.
Waste in the ponds produced by leaching gold from ore and in the pits produced by leaching copper from ore is a source of potential environmental dangers: drinking their toxic solution could kill wildlife; and leaks and overflows from them and their flooding could contaminate groundwater, kill fish and aquatic life, and endanger fisheries.
Concerns about potentially harmful effects of mining waste also could cause tourism to decrease.
Commercially used cyanide has caused real damage.
Work-related deaths have resulted from inhaling cyanide fumes.
More than 6,400 migratory birds and other animals were killed in Nevada by drinking water in the cyanide-laced ponds produced by gold mining operations.
